A transmitter hidden on the island, fitted with a time-delay mechanism, clicks on, sending its high-frequency radio signal to a communications satellite orbiting the earth. This signal is amplified and returned to earth where, simultaneously, it triggers the remaining nuclear warheads.

In 2012, whilst on winter vacation at your Uncle Jonas\u2019 and Aunt Betty-Ann\u2019s ranch in Texas, you were invited to visit a shale-oil mine near Austin; it was the first of its kind in Texas. As Chief of Construction, your uncle was proud to take you on a guided tour of the whole underground complex, which, for security reasons, was totally self-supporting. It was during this tour on 3 January 2012 that the holocaust began.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou remember how the ground shuddered when the shock waves from the first distant explosions reached the mine, and how you thought it was the start of an earthquake, the like of which you had experienced many times at home in California. But, as the levels nearest the surface began to collapse and the central elevator shaft filled with rubble, you realized the awful truth. At first there was no way of telling the extent of the surface devastation. Below ground, the safety generators had automatically switched into operation when the main power supply failed, and the tremors had faded quickly, which encouraged your aunt and uncle to believe that the damage above was superficial. Uncle Jonas was confident that the military would mount a rescue operation and that you would be brought out within a few days, a week at the most. Aunt Betty-Ann, too, was optimistic. After all, there were emergency supplies\u2014enough to feed 200 men for a whole month. Little did she know that the three of you would end up consuming all those supplies, or that the mine would become your home, your shelter, and your prison for the next eight years of your lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was early September in the year 2019 when eventually you broke through to the surface. When you set eyes on the landscape surrounding the mine, it was like looking at the surface of another planet. Few structures had survived the blizzards and intense cold that had swept around the world in the years following \u2018The Day\u2019, and now, after the dust had settled and the sun had returned, the once-fertile plains of Austin resembled little more than a desert of parched and broken rock, littered with the artefacts of an absent civilization. During the first few days, when you began to explore this wilderness, it was easy to believe that you were the only survivors. But on the morning of the fifth day Uncle Jonas made chance radio contact with a family called Ewell, who were living near the ruins of McKinney, thirty miles north of Dallas. They told him that they had been in touch with a handful of other groups who had managed somehow to survive the holocaust. Most were isolated and unable to move due to lack of fuel, food, or water. They were urging those who could travel to join them in McKinney to start a new community there, and some were already on their way. When your uncle and aunt accepted their invitation, the Ewells were enthusiastic but they also warned you to be wary\u2014not everyone who had survived wanted to establish a new community. The ruins of some large Texan cities, such as Dallas and Fort Worth, were controlled by gangs of criminals who fought with each other and terrorized anyone seeking to reestablish law and order. They urged you to avoid these gangs at all costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took more than a week to discover a vehicle that could transport you to McKinney. It was an old school bus, which had been parked in an underground lot and had survived the years of sub-zero blizzards. With fuel and spares salvaged from the mine, you managed to coax it back to life; then you set off on your journey north. When you arrived at the town, it was easy to find where the Ewells lived, as their ranch was the only place that was still standing. It looked more like an old frontier post than a ranch, with its fortified perimeter wall, lookout posts, and stake-filled moat. Having been ambushed and shot at by the city gangs of Fort Worth during the final stages of your journey, you recognized the need for such defences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Pop\u2019 Ewell, the seventy-year-old grandfather of the Ewell family, was the leader of this small colony of survivors, and it was he who had urged Uncle Jonas to join them when they had first made radio contact. The colony numbered less than a dozen at the time of your arrival, yet as the airwaves became clearer and new contacts were made, this number had soon more than doubled to twenty-five. It was decided that a name was needed to identify the settlement and \u2018Dallas Colony One\u2019 was adopted, \u2018DC1\u2019 for short. From that day on, everyone worked hard to make DC1 a secure haven for those seeking refuge from the hostile wastelands and marauding city gangs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Cutter\u2019 Jacks was one such refugee. Before \u2018The Day\u2019 he had been chief mechanic at the International Grand Prix Circuit near Lake Dallas, and his incredible skill and knowledge of engines was soon to prove invaluable to the colony. He taught you how to drive, and from a pile of old wrecks that you helped him salvage from the circuit, he built you a powerful, customized car. You used it to patrol the highways north of the city, keeping a lookout for gangs of city punks who frequently mounted raids to steal or destroy DC1\u2019s supplies. Cutter also taught you to shoot, and it was your natural prowess with a gun and your skill behind the wheel that were to earn you the begrudging respect of your enemies, who took to calling you the \u2018Freeway Warrior\u2019.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESix months after you arrived at DC1, the colony was faced with a major crisis. A heat wave was causing a drought that threatened to destroy the food supply. Crops were failing and the colony\u2019s artesian well, its only source of uncontaminated water, was beginning to dry up. The drought was also provoking more attacks from the city punks, who were desperate for food and water. Their common need had united them and now they posed a very real threat to the security of DC1. It was the last day of May 2020, when Pop Ewell made radio contact with another colony, who were based in the city of Big Spring, 300 miles west of McKinney. Their situation was completely the reverse of DC1\u2019s: they had food and water in plentiful supply but they were desperately short of fuel. They told of their contact with survivors in Tucson, Arizona, who were also without fuel. The Tucson colony reported that the territories west of the mountains of the Sierra Nevada had been spared the worst effects of the radioactive blizzards that had devastated the rest of the country and, miraculously, much of southern California was still widely populated: it had survived the last eight years virtually intact. When you heard the news you could hardly believe your ears. Perhaps your family were still alive. After all that had happened, there was now a real hope that one day you might be reunited with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA meeting was held to decide how best to deal with the crisis facing DC1. Everyone agreed that to stay at McKinney would lead to eventual death, either slowly from starvation or suddenly at the hands of the murderous city gangs. The only choice open to DC1 was to try to reach California; only there lay real hope for the future of the colony. The decision was relayed to the survivors at Big Spring and a deal was struck to rendezvous with them as soon as possible. DC1 would give them fuel in exchange for food and water, and together they would join up with the Tucson colony for the final stage of the journey to California.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECareful preparations were made for the long trek, and three vehicles were chosen to make up the convoy: the school bus, your customized roadster, and a gasolene tanker laden with 5000 gallons of petroleum siphoned from underground storage tanks at the Ewell ranch. Supplies of food and water were adequate but the colony lacked sufficient firearms and ammunition with which to defend itself. On the day before the convoy was due to leave, one of the colonists was sent north to search the town of Sherman for weapons. He radioed back to say that he had found a cache of hunting rifles and ammunition, but that his truck had broken down and he was stranded in the town. He had also found a survivor\u2014a beautiful teenage girl\u2014and he requested that you go to Sherman to pick them up. As soon as you arrived you were ambushed by the scouts of a brutal gang of bikers known as the Detroit Lions and, in the ensuing gun battle, you killed Stinger\u2014the scouts\u2019 leader.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELater you learned that the girl\u2014Kate Norton\u2014was the sole survivor of a Kansas City colony, which had been attacked and wiped out by the Detroit Lions. The Lions\u2019 leader, who calls himself \u2018Mad Dog Michigan\u2019, had taken a liking to her and spared her life. Mad Dog was once a high-ranking HAVOC agent who had escaped from Pontiac Deep Pen near Detroit, and he and his gang, most of whom were also HAVOC escapees, were heading for the Fort Hood Military Reserve near Killeen, Texas, the largest armoury in the whole of the United States. There he hoped to find enough weapons to equip the other HAVOC clans who were now in control of cities all along the eastern seaboard. Kate had managed to steal a motorcycle and escape from their camp, but Mad Dog was determined to get her back. He sent his brother\u2014Stinger\u2014and a handful of his best scouts to track her down, and they had finally caught up with her at Sherman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Mad Dog learned that you had killed his brother, he vowed to get even with you at any price. He abandoned his plans to loot Fort Hood and embarked instead on a relentless pursuit of your colony as it crossed the sun-scorched wastelands of Texas. The journey to Big Spring was fraught with great danger, and yet, in spite of the many perils you faced, or perhaps because of them, you felt yourself falling in love with Kate. Moreover you sensed that she was becoming increasingly fond of you. Sadly, the convoy was only a few miles from Big Spring when disaster struck. The land surrounding the settlement was controlled by a gang of bikers, a renegade clan called the \u2018Mavericks\u2019 who had been the bane of the Big Spring colony for many months. As the convoy drew nearer to its destination, the Mavericks launched an attack, and, in the running battle that ensued, they captured and abducted Kate. The convoy entered the fortified gates of Big Spring to a rapturous welcome from the colonists of that settlement, but for you the mood of celebration was soured by the vivid memory of Kate\u2019s abduction. You vowed to rescue her, and from that moment on, every waking minute of every day at Big Spring was spent thinking about little else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy chance it transpired that the leader of the Mavericks, a blond-haired murderer called Amex Gold, was a former HAVOC agent who had served under Mad Dog Michigan before \u2018The Day\u2019. He offered to join forces with the Lions, and, as a gesture of his loyalty to his former commander, he returned Kate to him. Together the Lions and the Mavericks launched a hasty attack on Big Spring, yet, although they outnumbered the colony by more than three to one, they were unable to breach the settlement\u2019s fortified perimeter wall, and were repelled with heavy losses. On the day after the attack, Pop Ewell discovered the radio frequency that the clansmen were using and was able to eavesdrop on their communications. He learned that Mad Dog had ordered another HAVOC clan\u2014the Saints\u2014who were based in New Orleans, to come to reinforce his command; they were expected to arrive within the week. He also overheard Mad Dog arrange a meeting with Mekong Mike, the leader of the Angelinos, a gang who controlled the city of San Angelo. He wanted him as an ally and was prepared to offer guns and ammunition in return for his help in destroying the Big Spring colony. Two days later, Mad Dog Michigan set off for San Angelo at the head of a motorcycle pack 200 riders strong. Those few clansmen who remained with Amex Gold tried all manner of tricks to convince the colony that the Mavericks and the Lions still surrounded Big Spring in strength, but to no avail. The senior members of the newly-enlarged colony convened a meeting at which it was decided that, with the clansmen now at their weakest, and with the appearance of the New Orleans gang expected at any time, a breakout had to be attempted without delay. There was only one way for the colony to reach Tucson overland and that was to follow the remains of Interstate Freeway 10 through the arid, mountainous territory of western Texas. Precisely halfway between Big Spring and Tucson is the city of El Paso. To reach this city in one piece became the convoy\u2019s goal, for it lay at the end of a long and tortuous stretch of mountain highway, undoubtedly one of the toughest you would have to face on your journey to California.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnder cover of darkness, the convoy escaped from Big Spring and sped westwards, now your vow to rescue Kate could at last be attempted and, at the first opportunity, you told the colony of your plans. Reluctantly they let you leave the convoy and go to San Angelo, where you intended to infiltrate the meeting between the Lions and Angelinos in the hope of finding Kate there. Your skill and daring were rewarded: you were able to locate and rescue Kate from under the very noses of the clan leaders. During your escape from their city you killed Mekong Mike, the Angelinos\u2019 leader, and stole a map from Mad Dog Michigan. Later you discovered that this map contained vital details of a HAVOC operation to take over the whole of the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you escaped westwards from San Angelo, you encountered three soldiers, survivors from a World Defence League outpost in southern Texas, who were also heading for El Paso where the remnants of their command group were stationed. You joined them and together you made a rendezvous with the convoy at the entrance to the only passable road through the Apache Mountains. A fierce battle was raging along this pass, between the Mavericks and a renegade clan of Mexicans, who had crossed the border in search of food and supplies. The convoy was forced to run the gauntlet of their gunfire before finally reaching its goal. Upon entering the city, you received a warm welcome from the WDL command group who were defending the military reserve of Fort Bliss. They celebrated your arrival for several days until the victorious mood was soured by the appearance of Mad Dog Michigan and an army of clansmen over 1,000 strong. He had persuaded the Mexicans to join the Lions, the Mavericks, and the Saints, all of whom were now united to his cause. The situation was desperate. Faced by overwhelming odds the WDL command tried to negotiate with Mad Dog but he rejected their attempts with disdain. He sent a reply to the command leader, Captain Frankland, in which he reaffirmed his vow to avenge his brother\u2019s death. His aims were brutally simple: he promised that neither you, nor any of the colony, would ever leave El Paso alive. He set up headquarters in Ciudad Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, from which he directed his clan army to encircle and lay siege to the colony.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor two weeks, he launched repeated attacks calculated to weaken your defences. The colony withstood the assaults, but this constant attrition began to erode your hopes of ever being able to break out of El Paso and reach Tucson intact. Then a radio message was intercepted that was to turn the desperate situation into a crisis. A clan convoy of trucks was leaving Zaragoza bound for Mad Dog\u2019s headquarters in Ciudad Juarez. On board were enough high explosives to blow Fort Bliss and everyone in it to sightless atoms. Something had to be done to prevent Mad Dog from using these explosives. Out of desperation was born a daring plan to save the lives of the colony and disrupt the enemy just long enough for you all to break out of El Paso.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe plan is to destroy the explosives as soon as they reach Ciudad Juarez to prevent Mad Dog Michigan from using them against the colony. It is a dangerous and potentially suicidal mission, too difficult for one man alone, so Captain Frankland offers to lead the mission and calls for three volunteers to accompany him. WDL Sergeant Haskell and WDL Marine Knott accept the challenge, but no one else steps forward readily to fill the remaining place. The future of the colony hinges on the success of this mission, and with this thought paramount in your mind, you summon up the courage to volunteer as the fourth member of the team.\u003C/p\u003E"

Five hundred yards away, across a rubble-strewn no-man\u2019s-land, clan snipers are entrenched behind a makeshift barricade of old cars and other debris. Their rifles are trained on Fort Bliss and, in the past, they have been all too eager to use them whenever a target has presented itself. Crossing this zone will be perilous in the extreme and, in order to minimize the risks of the mission failing here, the captain proposes that the team split into pairs and cross the zone at two separate locations.
