Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EIn 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E\u2014the first {{characterName}} interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe\u2019s first book laid the foundations for the future of the {{characterName}} series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThe {{characterName}} series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n     \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGary Chalk\u003C/strong\u003E, the illustrator of the early {{characterName}} series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary was working as a children\u2019s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain\u2019s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, \u003Ccite\u003EThe Jungle of Horrors\u003C/cite\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary has also drawn the illustrations in \u003Ccite\u003ERedwall\u003C/cite\u003E and related books, \u003Ccite\u003EThe Prince of Shadows\u003C/cite\u003E gamebook series, and several books which he also authored.

All of the Kai warriors were in attendance for the feast of Fehmarn, and all except you were massacred.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou fought your way to Holmgard, the capital of your country, where the King sent you upon a desperate quest for help. Your mission was fraught with great danger, for Sommerlund had been betrayed by one of its own magicians\u2014Vonotar the Traitor. His agents sought to kill you at every opportunity, but your skill and strength defeated their evil aims. You returned to Holmgard at the head of a great fleet\u2014the allies of Durenor\u2014and destroyed the Darklord army that besieged your capital.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch of Sommerlund was ruined by the war. The rich farmlands were laid waste and many towns were razed to the ground. But the Sommlending are a tough people and were undaunted by the enormous task that lay ahead. They set about the rebuilding of war-torn Sommerlund with such determination that now, one year later, few of the scars of war remain visible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the crucial part that you played in the victory, the King has bestowed upon you the rank and title of \u2018Fryearl of Sommerlund\u2019, a rare honour for one so young. The ruins of the Kai Monastery and much of the surrounding lands are now \u2018Fryelund\u2019 under your protection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWork to rebuild the monastery was about to commence when disturbing news from the north prompted the King to summon you to the capital. Many merchants, returning from the summer trading expeditions to Kalte, told of the fall of the Brumalmarc\u2014the leader of the Ice Barbarians. The description of the hunchbacked magician who has succeeded the fierce Brumalmarc fits only one man\u2014Vonotar the Traitor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the defeat of the Darklords, Vonotar escaped to the frozen wastes of Kalte. He made his way to the ice fortress of Ikaya where, through deception, he tricked the cruel Brumalmarc into adopting him as his magician. It was a mistake that was to cost the barbarian leader his fortress and his life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe news that Vonotar still lives spreads like wildfire throughout Sommerlund. Thousands of Sommlending surround the capital and demand that Vonotar be made to pay for his treachery. So great is the outcry that the King is obliged to promise that the evil traitor will be brought back to Holmgard, and made to stand trial for his crimes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor you, {{characterName}}, the King\u2019s promise is the start of a quest that will pit you against a hated foe, deep within the hostile Caverns of Kalte.\u003C/p\u003E"

They were formless creatures, without shape and substance, and existed as pure energy in another dimension, beyond the confines of space and time. The Ice Demons discovered the Vagadyn gate, a sort of door between their world and Magnamund; they fought each other to enter this gate, unaware of the fate that awaited them. The Ancients had also discovered the gate. As the Ice Demons passed through the Vagadyn, their spirits were imprisoned in crystals by the cunning Ancients, who harnessed the power of the Ice Demons to build Ikaya. The M\u2019lare bowls that light the fortress each contain the spirits of lesser Ice Demons trapped within.
