Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EIn 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E\u2014the first {{characterName}} interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden).

When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary was working as a children\u2019s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain\u2019s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E.

By the time you have disentangled yourselves, the boat is firmly in the grip of the river current. You grab an oar and fight to keep the boat in the centre of the rushing water as it speeds on its course through the foothills of the Maaken Range. But no sooner has the boat been brought under control than you are confronted by an unexpected hazard: ahead of you the river suddenly disappears into the rock-face beneath a massive granite ledge. It is too late to avoid being swept into the inky black cavern, and as you glide into the darkness, you prepare yourself for any hidden dangers that may lurk inside."
