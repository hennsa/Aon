Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EIn 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E\u2014the first {{characterName}} interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe\u2019s first book laid the foundations for the future of the {{characterName}} series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThe {{characterName}} series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n    \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGary Chalk\u003C/strong\u003E, the illustrator of the early {{characterName}} series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary was working as a children\u2019s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain\u2019s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, \u003Ccite\u003EThe Jungle of Horrors\u003C/cite\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary has also drawn the illustrations in \u003Ccite\u003ERedwall\u003C/cite\u003E and related books, \u003Ccite\u003EThe Prince of Shadows\u003C/cite\u003E gamebook series, and several books which he also authored.

You are surprised to read the King\u2019s message, for it is a request for your help in solving an urgent problem of what he describes as \u2018great diplomatic importance\u2019. It seems a strange request to make of a warrior lord, whose skills are better suited to the field of battle than to parleying with foreign envoys. However, you obey the summons and upon your arrival at the capital, all is made clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Zakhan of Vassagonia, the imperial ruler of this desert empire, has sent his most trusted envoy to seek a treaty of peace between your two countries, and you have been asked to sign the treaty on behalf of your country. The reason for this is easily apparent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELess than a year ago, a renegade noble of Vassagonia called Barraka led his army of bandits in an attack upon the Sommlending province of Ruanon. This mining town and much of the surrounding land was overrun and destroyed. Many Sommlending lost their lives, and many more were enslaved and forced to labour in the mines of the Maaken Range. When the regular convoy from Ruanon failed to arrive at the capital, the king sent you to investigate. A great battle ensued in which you defeated Barraka in mortal combat. Without your courage and skill, the safety of Sommerlund and all of the Lastlands would have been placed in grave peril.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Your majesty, the Zakhan is gravely embarrassed by Barraka\u2019s foul treachery, and is most anxious that our friendship and trust be restored. He begs that you send the Kai warrior, {{characterName}}, to sign a treaty of peace with him at the Grand Palace in Barrakeesh,\u2019 whimpers the Zakhan\u2019s emissary, as he kneels at the feet of King Ulnar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe king rises from his throne, barely able to conceal his distaste for the fawning envoy. He turns his gaze to you and bids you follow him to the privacy of an antechamber.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018I have no liking for this desert realm, {{characterName}}, but I like the prospect of war even less. The Zakhan is old and frail, and has no son to claim his throne when he dies. Barraka was but one of many ruthless nobles who wait like jackals for the chance to seize power, and I fear they grow too impatient to allow the Zakhan to die a natural death. The treaty may not guarantee peace with Vassagonia once the Zakhan is dead, but it will at least buy us precious time to strengthen our southern border.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe king leads you to a window and points towards the harbour, barely visible through the falling snow. A Vassagonian galley lies anchored close to the harbour wall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Go to Vassagonia, {{characterName}}. Sign the treaty and return quickly. Even with the promise of peace, I fear the shadow of war will fall upon us before the year is out.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou wave farewell to Holmgard on this bleak midwinter\u2019s day, feeling sure you will return before the thaw. But as you watch the spires of Holmgard disappear in the falling snow, you have no inkling of the shadow that awaits you in Vassagonia.\u003C/p\u003E"

The six other cities of this vast arid country are mainly to be found in the thin coastal strip, such as Ferufezan in the northwest, and Bisutan in the south. Barrakeesh is cut off from most of the rest of Vassagonia by the semicircle of the Kabar Range. These mountains meet the sea on the eastern coast at Cape Kabar, which overlooks a trio of islands.

The Black Zakhan was a brutal tyrant, the cruellest of an evil lineage that ruled over the desert empire long ago. The barbaric excesses of his reign have never been forgotten in the Lastlands. The Grand Palace was built by his army of slaves, prisoners from countries he had conquered in war. The palace became his obsession; he personally oversaw its entire construction and punished the workers personally if there was the slightest delay. He butchered his subjects indiscriminately and in the most terrible fashion. His favourite form of execution was for the victim to be sawn in half from head to foot until the body fell in two pieces. However, it was the mass execution of the slaves who built the Grand Palace that made him infamous. He slaughtered every slave worker so that his enemies could never learn of the secret treasure chambers he had had constructed. Among the slaves were his only daughters, Kebilla and Sousse, who openly opposed their father\u2019s cruelty and tried to prevent the executions. In a blind rage, he ordered that they should be the first to die."
