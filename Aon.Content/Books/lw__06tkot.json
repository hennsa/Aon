Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EIn 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E\u2014the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe\u2019s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThe Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n     \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGary Chalk\u003C/strong\u003E, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary was working as a children\u2019s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain\u2019s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, \u003Ccite\u003EThe Jungle of Horrors\u003C/cite\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EGary has also drawn the illustrations in \u003Ccite\u003ERedwall\u003C/cite\u003E and related books, \u003Ccite\u003EThe Prince of Shadows\u003C/cite\u003E gamebook series, and several books which he also authored.

Since Haakon\u2019s defeat, the power of the Darklords has waned. Rumours abound that a civil war rages in Helgedad, as the lesser Darklords fight for power and dominion over the city. However, it is a widely held belief in Sommerlund that your discovery of the lost Sommlending treasure, \u003Ccite\u003EThe Book of the Magnakai\u003C/cite\u003E, is the real reason for their power struggle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ccite\u003EThe Book of the Magnakai\u003C/cite\u003E is legendary in Sommerlund. With the wisdom of the Magnakai, Sun Eagle, the first Kai Grand Master, instilled the disciplines into the warriors of Sommerlund that were to protect your land from devastation at the hands of the Darklords. \u003Ccite\u003EThe Book of the Magnakai\u003C/cite\u003E was lost hundreds of years ago, but its wisdom was kept alive, handed down through generations of Kai so that they too could share the strength to resist their eternal enemies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you discovered \u003Ccite\u003EThe Book of the Magnakai\u003C/cite\u003E, you gave a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory and so ensure the security of your land in the years to come. You returned to your homeland and, in the seclusion of your monastery in the hills, set about the study of the Magnakai Disciplines. It was an exacting task\u2014a trial of physical strength and mental fortitude. The seasons came and went, but you were unaware of the passage of time, lost in your quest for the knowledge and the skills of your warrior kin. Three years of determined study pass, revealing the secrets of three of the Magnakai Disciplines. However, the others cannot be learnt by study alone, and in order to fulfil your pledge to restore the Kai, you must complete the quest first made by Sun Eagle over a thousand years ago. When he had finally completed his quest, he recorded all his experiences in \u003Ccite\u003EThe Book of the Magnakai\u003C/cite\u003E, but the script has faded with the passing years and now few words remain to guide you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Seek and find the Lorestone of Varetta, for this alone holds the power and the wisdom\u2026\u2019 are the few words you can still decipher of the Grand Master\u2019s chronicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the verse is brief you are not without hope, for you recognize the name Varetta. It is one of the oldest cities of Magnamund, lying in the Stornlands beyond the Maakengorge, far to the south of Sommerlund. You realize that you must set out upon the quest without delay, for the war in Helgedad will not last indefinitely, and the Darklords swore long ago to conquer your country and destroy your people. As soon as their civil strife is resolved, the victorious lords of evil will turn on Sommerlund and summon the creatures of the Dark Realm to thwart your quest. You must therefore act quickly and with secrecy, for your life and the future of Sommerlund depend on your success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, guided by the words of your ancient mentor and with the shadow of the Darklords ever present, you set out on the quest for the Lorestone of Varetta, unaware of the wonders and the horrors that await you in the Stornlands.\u003C/p\u003E"

He set the stone upon a gold sceptre and used it in battle to inspire his fanatical followers and crush his foes. He believed it made him invulnerable, but this was not so\u2014he was killed on his royal barge during a battle at Rhem, and the Lorestone was lost when the gold sceptre fell from his hand into the depths of the River Storn. There were many accounts of the sceptre having been found, but they had always proved to be untrue or simply fanciful. It was said that whoever wielded the Lorestone was the rightful ruler of all the Stornlands. For this reason alone it was often sought by evil or unscrupulous warlords, and many had pursued the quest, all without success."

He believed that it made him invulnerable, but it was not so. He was killed in a battle on board his royal barge at Rhem, and the Lorestone was lost when it fell from his hand into the depths of the River Storn. However, that is not the end of the story. There are many tales about the sceptre having been found, but on the whole they have turned out to be fake or merely fanciful. The legend says whoever wields the Lorestone is the rightful ruler of all the Stornlands. For this reason above all others, the Lorestone is sought by many evil or unscrupulous men to further their dreams of power. If you wish to know more, you should go to Varetta.
