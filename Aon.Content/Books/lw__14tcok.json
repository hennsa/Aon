After the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, the fearsome city-fortress of Kaag became a refuge for the remains of their broken armies.

Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EIn 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E\u2014the first {{characterName}} interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe\u2019s first book laid the foundations for the future of the {{characterName}} series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThe {{characterName}} series ended after 28 books and 14 years.

Brian Williams was Joe\u2019s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe\u2019s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the \u003Ccite\u003E{{characterName}}\u003C/cite\u003E series.

These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain\u2014the Darklands\u2014and caused the destruction of their leader, Archlord Gnaag, and the seat of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Northern Magnamund. Some factions which were part of this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war, which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Skilfully their commanders exploited the chaos and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor five years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction, the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a Second Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well underway. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possesses latent Kai skills and all show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYour attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection\u2014to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and organized the training of the Second Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded and, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power that you had recovered during your quest for the Magnakai. It was here, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, that you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors\u2014Banedon and Rimoah\u2014you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines, and grasp the fundamental secrets of Left-handed and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this time many changes were occurring beyond the borders of Sommerlund. In the regions to the northeast of Magador and the Maakengorge, the Elder Magi of Dessi and the Herbwardens of Bautar were working together in an effort to restore the dusty volcanic wasteland to its former fertile state. It was the first tentative step towards the reclamation of all the Darklands. However, their progress was painfully slow and both parties were resigned to the fact that their efforts to undo the damage caused by the Darklords would take not years but centuries to complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the far west, the Drakkarim had retreated to their homelands and were engaged in a bloody war against the Lencians. Much of Nyras had been reclaimed by the armies of King Sarnac, the Lencian commander, and his flag now flew over territory which, two thousand years ago, had once been part of Lencia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the destruction of the Darklords of Helgedad, the Giaks, the most prolific in number of all of Gnaag\u2019s troops, fled into the Darklands and sought refuge in the gigantic city-fortresses of Nadgazad, Aarnak, Gournen, and Kaag. Within each of these hellish strongholds fierce fighting broke out as remnants of the Xaghash (lesser Darklords) and the Nadziranim (evil practitioners of Right-handed magic who once aided individual Darklord masters) fought for control. It is widely believed that by the time the Elder Magi and the Herbwardens reach the walls of these strongholds the occupants will have long since brought about their own extinction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EElsewhere, throughout northern Magnamund, peace reigns victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the age of the Darklords has finally come to an end. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of Naar come in many guises and there are those who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly six months ago the evil Cener Druids of Ruel attempted to enact Naar\u2019s revenge. Secretly, in the laboratories of their foul stronghold of Mogaruith, they had laboured to create a virulent plague virus capable of killing every living creature upon Magnamund, save their own kind. Word of their terrible plan reached Lord Rimoah who immediately urged the rulers of the Freelands to raise armies and invade Ruel. Hurriedly they complied, but the invasion ended in disaster. Seven thousand fighting men entered Ruel intent on storming the fortress of Mogaruith and razing it to the ground. Seven thousand marched into the dark realm; only seventy emerged alive. The Ceners were within days of perfecting their ultimate weapon when you took up the challenge and ventured alone into Mogaruith. Despite overwhelming odds you thwarted their evil plan by destroying the virus and the means by which it was created.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter emerging from Ruel triumphant, your quest fulfilled, you returned home to Sommerlund and the Kai Monastery where you resumed your duties as Grand Master. Three months later, on the day that saw the first fall of winter snow, you were visited by Lord Rimoah. Once again he found himself the reluctant bearer of ill news. Your friend Guildmaster Banedon, whilst helping with the reclamation of wastelands close to the Maakengorge, had been abducted by a war-band of Giaks under the command of Nadziranim sorcerers. A rescue was attempted, but ruthlessly the Nadziranim obliterated those who tried to follow their escape into the Darklands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018The Nadziranim have grown bold of late,\u2019 said Lord Rimoah, his words tinged with fear and bitterness. \u2018They have a newfound power and are keen to exercise it. It would have taken considerable skill and energy to ensnare one as gifted as Banedon.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018But why Banedon?\u2019 you asked, trying at once to comprehend and come to terms with the loss of your trusted friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018I fear that the Nadziranim seek to extract from him the secrets of Left-handed magic, so that they may be able to marry it to their own foul sorcery. Such an outcome would give them extraordinary power. It could herald the rebirth of the Darklands.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt once you recalled how such an attempt to unite the two paths of magic had resulted in catastrophe for Sommerlund. Vonotar the Traitor, a magician from the same guild as Banedon, had betrayed his homeland in exchange for the promise of Nadziranim power. It was his act of treachery that brought about the invasion of Sommerlund and the destruction of the First Order of the Kai.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018What can be done?\u2019 you asked of Rimoah, fearful that it may already be too late to save your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Banedon is still alive, of that I\u2019m sure. The Nadziranim have taken him to the old Darklord city-fortress of Kaag. His life is in deadly danger but they will not kill him until they have succeeded in extracting the knowledge they crave. We can only pray that he is strong enough to resist them until\u2026\u2019 Lord Rimoah held you with his eyes, words no longer necessary. It was clear that all hope for Banedon\u2019s survival depended upon his swift rescue from Kaag, and there was only one who could effect such a perilous quest with any hope of success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018So be it,\u2019 you said, resolutely, \u2018I accept the mission. I alone will go to Kaag and secure his release\u2026or die valiantly in the attempt.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E"

The plan is to traverse the Durncrag Range and enter the Darklands under cover of a dust storm which is currently sweeping southwards towards Kaag. A landing will be made ten miles to the northeast of the city-fortress, beyond a ridge of hills that will keep the Skyrider hidden from the eyes of Kaag\u2019s watchful lookouts. From there you are to make your way to the fortress on foot, enter as best you can, locate and rescue Banedon, and then return with him to the Skyrider which will carry you back to the safety of Sommerlund. You will have 48 hours in which to complete your mission. If, after the two days have elapsed, you have not returned, Rimoah will be forced to assume that you and the Guildmaster have perished. The dust storm will not last for more than two days, after which time there is a grave danger that the Skyrider will be spotted and attacked by the Kraan and Zlanbeasts which are known to patrol the skies around Kaag."

Its horny eyelids save its sight and quickly it recovers, now more determined to fulfil Cadak\u2019s command. Hastily you draw a hand weapon as the shadow of the beast falls upon you."

Its highest point towers two miles above the desolate plain. Thunder booms and streaks of blue-white lightning earth themselves against its walls, drawn from the rolling storm clouds gathered menacingly overhead."
