Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people.

His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden).

Brian Williams was Joe\u2019s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe\u2019s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the \u003Ccite\u003E{{characterName}}\u003C/cite\u003E series.

These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain\u2014the Darklands\u2014and caused the destruction of their leader and the base of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Some factions which were part of this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Skilfully their commanders exploited the chaos and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor seven years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a New Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well established. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time here at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYour attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection\u2014to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and the training of the New Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded for, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power which you had recovered during an earlier quest for Kai knowledge. In this vault, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors\u2014Banedon and Rimoah\u2014you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines, and grasp the fundamental secrets of Brotherhood and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the years following your victory over the Darklords, peace has reigned victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the evil which once threatened to destroy them has been banished from the face of Magnamund. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of the Dark God Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready your newfound skills have been tested against Naar\u2019s agents and you have, on each occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. But your continuing victories against his minions have enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. One such minion, the powerful Deathlord of Ixia, threatened to enslave the free nations of Magnamund with a weapon forged by Naar himself. Bravely you ventured alone into the Deathlord\u2019s icy domain and confronted him in a life-or-death battle in which you were triumphant. However, as you were returning from the Deathlord\u2019s frigid realm you learned that Sommerlund had been attacked. In your absence, Naar had sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to destroy the New Order of the Kai and lay waste to your homeland.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe news came as a terrible shock. In Ixia you had won a great victory over Evil, yet at what cost? You had no doubts that the New Order were worthy Kai warriors, but they were all so young, their mettle as yet untested in the furnace-heat of battle. Secretly you feared that they would be unable to resist Naar\u2019s newest champions, and so you resolved to return as quickly as possible to Sommerlund to take command of the Kai Monastery and orchestrate your country\u2019s defences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the court of King Sarnac of Lencia, in the city of Vadera, you received a pledge from the King himself that he would do all in his power to help speed your long journey home to Sommerlund. Accompanied by Lord Ardan, a friend and magician from the land of Dessi, you were put aboard a Lencian clipper, one of the fastest of all sea-going vessels. This ship was bound for Garthen\u2014the principal city of Talestria\u2014which lies more than a thousand miles to the east of Vadera. This was to be the first stage of your journey back to Sommerlund, a destination more than two thousand miles from Lencia. As you set sail from Vadera harbour you knew that you were embarking upon a race against time, a desperate race in which the future of your country and the New Order of the Kai were at stake.\u003C/p\u003E"

The mood of the troops is one of studied indifference, a condition which often prevails in those who have become emotionally numbed by the horrors of war. As this sullen mass moves through the west gate, you glance up at the battlements and notice a red-robed figure clutching a long staff of glowing white metal. A tingle of apprehension runs the length of your spine when you recognize the figure to be a Cener Druid. The staff he holds radiates a magical aura and you sense at once that he is scanning the arriving soldiers, using the staff to determine, amongst other things, if any have contracted plague. Suddenly the Cener becomes agitated and he sprints the length of the battlements to sound an alarm bell. Within a few moments, the west gate is sealed by a heavy iron portcullis and panic sweeps through the troops who have been shut outside. You look up at the battlements once more and this time your heart skips a beat; the Cener is pointing his glowing staff directly at your head."
