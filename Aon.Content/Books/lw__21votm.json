These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. The leader of your illustrious fighting order\u2014the legendary warrior {{characterName}}\u2014was the sole survivor of the First Order of the Kai, and as a young initiate he had stood amid the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and had vowed to avenge the massacre of his comrades. In the year MS\u0026nbsp;5070 he was to keep his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the base of their power\u2014the infernal city of Helgedad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of {{characterName}} the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly reestablished. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS\u0026nbsp;5063, during the era of war against the Darklords, and you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery at the age of seven to develop your martial skills and the latent Kai abilities which lie dormant in some Sommlending. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and honed to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the year MS\u0026nbsp;5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during {{characterName}}\u2019s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it) the Dark God sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by {{characterName}} and the King\u2019s Army of Sommerlund.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe defeat of his minions enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years later he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called \u2018Wolf\u2019s Bane\u2019 who was the very image of {{characterName}}. While your leader was engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland in his guise and sought to destroy the reputation and the honour of the Kai. He would have succeeded had not {{characterName}} returned home and pursued this enemy to an ancient necropolis in the Sommlending city of Tyso. There, deep within a subterranean crypt, he and his evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness\u2014Naar\u2019s stronghold\u2014where a deadly duel ensued. {{characterName}} vanquished the foe and discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti. This wondrous artefact was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund had heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund has since been measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone\u2019s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the mysterious Isle of Lorn in Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of {{characterName}}\u2019s eyes had told him that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of Naar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} realized that the Dark God had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world, while the forces of the Gods of Good, Kai and Ishir, had been held at bay. Only {{characterName}} and the New Order of the Kai had stood in the way of the onslaught of Naar\u2019s agents since the demise of the Darklords.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} successfully escaped from the Plane of Darkness and returned to Sommerlund, yet he knew that the fight against Evil had not been won outright. He realized that he would have to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from Naar\u2019s legions of darkness. Two years ago, with the aid of his most trusted ally, Lord Rimoah of Dessi, {{characterName}} fulfilled his vow by journeying to the Dark God\u2019s domain and retrieving the Moonstone of the Shianti. Upon his triumphant return, {{characterName}} placed the Moonstone in the Vault of the Sun\u2014his personal chamber located deep below the fortified citadel of the Kai Monastery. He had hoped that the fabled artefact could remain there indefinitely, to be guarded by generations of Kai who would keep it secure from Naar\u2019s minions. Retrieval of the Moonstone had denied the Dark God\u2019s champions ready access to Magnamund, yet {{characterName}} knew that there were many lesser agents of Naar upon Magnamund waiting quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding. Undoubtedly they would stop at nothing to retrieve the Moonstone for their fell master.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin a year of his return home it became clear to {{characterName}} that his wish could not be fulfilled. At first the presence of the Moonstone seemed greatly beneficial to Sommerlund. Crops grew abundantly, incidence of disease and illness became increasingly rare, and the newly-born were uniformly healthy. Even the offspring of the impoverished who, in normal times, could expect only one in three of their infants to survive longer than a month after birth, were all in good health and exceptional in their physical and mental development. The Sommlending called this extraordinary period of providence \u2018the Blessing of the Moonstone\u2019, yet this time of good fortune could not last. The power of the Moonstone was a great force for Good, but it was also greatly disruptive of the natural order of Magnamund. Soon death itself became a rarity in Sommerlund, and the four seasons of the year were slowly transformed into one unending spring. {{characterName}} was deeply concerned at the changes wrought by the Moonstone and sought the counsel of his closest friend\u2014Guildmaster Banedon, leader of Sommerlund\u2019s Brotherhood of Magicians. Banedon entreated him to relinquish the Moonstone before the effects of its power became irreversible. To right the balance of nature the Moonstone would have to be taken to the Isle of Lorn, in the southernmost reaches of Magnamund, and delivered back into the hands of the Shianti. Only they, its creators, could prevent its powers from disrupting the natural order of your world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} agreed with Banedon\u2014the Moonstone would have to be returned to the Shianti. The physical effects of its presence were beginning to attract the unwelcome attentions of those who secretly sought to enact Naar\u2019s revenge upon the Kai. When one of Naar\u2019s agents was captured by a Kai patrol within a few miles of the monastery, {{characterName}} felt he could wait no longer. He resolved to act immediately. Preparations were made for a long journey and, especially among the lower ranks of the Kai, rumours were rife that {{characterName}} himself would take responsibility for carrying the Moonstone to the Shianti. Indeed, this speculation seemed to be confirmed as fact when it was discovered that he had secured the use of Guildmaster Banedon\u2019s famous flying ship\u2014\u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt therefore came as a shock when, early one morning, you were summoned unexpectedly to the Vault of the Sun. In strictest confidence, Supreme Master {{characterName}} informed you that he had decided to entrust you with the task of taking the Moonstone to the Shianti. The elaborate preparation he was undertaking was simply a diversion, a bluff designed to draw attention away from the vital mission that he wished to entrust to you\u2014the most talented and courageous of his Kai Grand Masters.\u003C/p\u003E"

It is only through the use of your Kai curing skills that you are able to make him breathe again and bring him back from the edge of the abyss. You set his fractured leg but, despite your best efforts, you cannot return him to consciousness."

The crew scream with terror when they look upon their comrade, for his upper body has been transformed into a blackened and fleshless skull that perches precariously upon his hollow, smoking rib cage."

Fearing the worst, you rush along the narrow corridor and throw open the door to Oriah\u2019s cabin. You find her huddled below her bunk, sobbing quietly. You comfort her as best you can but she is overcome with grief; Fernant died whilst protecting her and she blames herself for his death and for the calamity which has befallen The Pride of Sommerlund. She tells you that the raiders came from Ghol-Tabras, the city ruled by her evil suitor. She is convinced that the reason they attacked the ship was to capture her."

Moments after the pirates fire their gun, you hear the whistle of a heavy cannonball as it hurtles across the deck of The Pride of Sommerlund. Fortunately the pirates are poor gunners and it passes within inches of the mainmast before splashing harmlessly into the ocean. Sergeant Dryan commands his men to return fire and a volley of shots from the three swivel guns slams into the bow of the pirate ship with devastating effect. Two shots penetrate below the waterline and the third severs the bowsprit. As it falls into the ocean, it rips away sail and rigging which drag more than a dozen pirates overboard. In disarray, the enemy vessel veers from its collision course and founders in the wake of The Pride of Sommerlund as it enters the Bukimi Channel. Here your ship picks up a prevailing wind which propels it away from the second pirate raider. Soon both ships have disappeared and, when Raker is sure that the danger has passed, he warmly praises both the marines and his crew for the skill and courage they have displayed."
