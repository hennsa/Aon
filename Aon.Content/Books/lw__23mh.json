Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people.

His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden).

Brian Williams was Joe\u2019s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe\u2019s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the \u003Ccite\u003E{{characterName}}\u003C/cite\u003E series.

These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. The leader of your illustrious fighting order\u2014{{characterName}}\u2014was the sole survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS\u0026nbsp;5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of {{characterName}} the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of the new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS\u0026nbsp;5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of {{characterName}}, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the year MS\u0026nbsp;5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during {{characterName}}\u2019s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it) the Dark God Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by {{characterName}} and the King\u2019s Army of Sommerlund.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe defeat of his minions enraged Naar and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years later he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called \u2018Wolf\u2019s Bane\u2019 who was the very image of {{characterName}}. While your leader was engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland in his guise and sought to destroy the reputation and the honour of the Kai. He would have succeeded had not {{characterName}} returned home and pursued this enemy to an ancient necropolis in the Sommlending city of Tyso. There, deep within a subterranean crypt, he and his evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness\u2014Naar\u2019s stronghold\u2014where a deadly duel ensued. {{characterName}} vanquished the foe and discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti. This wondrous artefact was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund has since been measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone\u2019s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the mysterious Isle of Lorn in Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of {{characterName}}\u2019s eyes had told him that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of Naar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} realized that the Dark God had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world while the force of the Gods of Good\u2014Kai and Ishir\u2014had been held at bay. {{characterName}} and the New Order Kai were all that stood against the onslaught of Naar\u2019s agents following the demise of the Darklords.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} successfully escaped from the Plane of Darkness and returned to Sommerlund, yet he knew that the fight against Evil had not been won outright. He realized that he would have to return to the Plane of Darkness to retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from an invasion by Naar\u2019s legions of darkness. Two years ago, with the aid of his most trusted ally, Lord Rimoah of Dessi, {{characterName}} fulfilled his vow by journeying to the Dark God\u2019s domain and retrieving the Moonstone of the Shianti. Upon his triumphant return, {{characterName}} placed the Moonstone in the Vault of the Sun\u2014his personal chamber located deep below the fortified citadel of the Kai Monastery. He had hoped that the fabled artefact could remain there indefinitely, to be guarded by generations of Kai who would keep it secure from Naar\u2019s minions. Retrieval of the Moonstone had denied the Dark God\u2019s champions ready access to Magnamund, yet {{characterName}} knew that there were many lesser agents of Naar upon Magnamund waiting quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding. Undoubtedly they would stop at nothing to retrieve the Moonstone for their foul master.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin a year of his return home it became clear to {{characterName}} that his wish could not be fulfilled. At first the presence of the Moonstone seemed greatly beneficial to Sommerlund. Crops grew abundantly, incidence of disease and illness became increasingly rare, and the newly-born were uniformly healthy. Even the offspring of the impoverished who, in normal times, could expect only one in three of their infants to survive longer than a month beyond birth, were all in good health and exceptional in their physical and mental development. The Sommlending called this extraordinary period of providence the \u2018Blessing of the Moonstone\u2019, yet this time of good fortune could not last. The power of the Moonstone is a great force for Good, but it is also greatly disruptive of the natural order of Magnamund. Soon death itself became a rarity in Sommerlund, and the four seasons of the year were slowly transformed into one unending spring. {{characterName}} was deeply troubled by the changes wrought by the Moonstone and sought the counsel of his closest friend\u2014Guildmaster Banedon\u2014leader of Sommerlund\u2019s Brotherhood of Magicians. Banedon entreated him to relinquish the Moonstone before the effects of its power became irreversible. To right the imbalance of nature the Moonstone would have to be taken to the Isle of Lorn, in the southernmost reaches of Magnamund, and delivered back into the hands of the Shianti. Only they, its creators, could prevent its powers from disrupting the natural order of your world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} agreed with Banedon\u2014the Moonstone would have to be returned to the Shianti. The physical effects of its presence were beginning to attract the unwelcome attentions of those who secretly desire to enact Naar\u2019s revenge upon the Kai. When one of Naar\u2019s agents was captured by a Kai patrol within a few miles of the monastery, {{characterName}} felt he could wait no longer. He resolved to act immediately. Preparations were made for a long journey and, especially among the lower ranks of the Kai, rumours were rife that your leader would personally take responsibility for returning the Moonstone to the Shianti. Indeed, this speculation seemed to be confirmed as fact when it was discovered that {{characterName}} had secured the use of Guildmaster Banedon\u2019s famous flying ship\u2014\u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt therefore came as a shock when, early one morning, you were summoned unexpectedly to the Vault of the Sun. In strictest confidence, Supreme Master {{characterName}} informed you that he had decided to entrust you with the task of returning the Moonstone. His elaborate preparations were simply a diversion, a bluff designed to draw attention away from the vital mission that he wished you\u2014the most talented and courageous of his five Kai Grand Masters\u2014to undertake. It was with great pride and apprehension that you accepted the quest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} gave you the precious Moonstone in a seemingly ordinary satchel, yet the lining of this plain leather bag was woven from korlinium, a special mineral that would hide the Moonstone\u2019s powerful energies from the agents of Naar. In the guise of a Kai journeyman, you set sail from the Sommlending capital of Holmgard aboard a sailing ship that was to carry you south on the first leg of your journey, a voyage of 2,000 miles to Elzian, the capital of Dessi. This legendary city is home to Lord Rimoah and the Elder Magi. They are the last surviving members of Magnamund\u2019s oldest race of magicians and they had promised {{characterName}} that they would help you reach your final destination. You had hoped and expected the voyage to be swift and uneventful; however fate and ill fortune decreed otherwise. Your voyage was fraught with danger, yet you overcame the many perils ranged against you and eventually arrived at the Dessian capital, to the relief of Lord Rimoah and his anxious brother magicians who had feared the worst.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor three days you were treated to the hospitality of the Elder Magi and the freedom of the wondrous city of Elzian. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, having fully recovered from the rigours of your journey to Dessi, you set out upon the final stage of your quest\u2014the voyage to the Isle of Lorn. Passage had been arranged for you aboard a Suhnese trading ship called \u003Ccite\u003EThe Azan\u003C/cite\u003E. The ship\u2019s master, Captain Jenkshi, had been paid handsomely to carry you to his home port of Suhn and you had been promised a swift and comfortable voyage. However, this was not to be. In the Shadakine city-port of Ghol-Tabras you fell foul of Sesketera, the city\u2019s ruthless ruler, and you were forced to abandon \u003Ccite\u003EThe Azan\u003C/cite\u003E during your daring escape from his murderous bodyguards. After a perilous journey south by way of land and sea, you finally reached the Port of Suhn. There you made contact with Lord Zinair, the Dessian ambassador. He provided you with a small sailboat for your passage to the Isle of Lorn. This tiny island home of the Shianti lies no more than 200 miles east of the busy Port of Suhn, across the Sea of Dreams, yet no sailor has ever set eyes upon it for the Shianti have encircled their refuge with a web of enchantments, magical mists, and winds. Aided by the power of the Moonstone, you were able to navigate these mysterious waters and land upon the shores of Lorn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Shianti had sensed the approach of the Moonstone and were waiting to greet your arrival. In a formal ceremony in the sacred Temple of Amida you received the thanks and praise of Acarya, the leader of the Shianti exiles. Solemnly, he vowed to deliver the Moonstone into the hands of Goddess Ishir herself, thereby ensuring that never again would its power disrupt Magnamund\u2019s delicate balance of nature, nor be misused by the forces of Evil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the ceremony, the Shianti revealed to you some of the magical wonders of their island that have never before been seen by Man. You marvelled at flowing rivers of jewels, fabulous flora, and species of exotic fauna. After your tour of this paradise isle you were allowed to rest before being escorted to your sailboat to begin your journey back to the Port of Suhn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYour return voyage across the Sea of Dreams was swift and eerily smooth. You sensed that your direction and speed were being controlled by the Shianti, for within minutes of casting off from the shores of Lorn, the bustling harbour entrance to the Port of Suhn suddenly appeared from out of the swirling sea mist. A stiff breeze caught your sail and propelled you towards the quayside where Lord Zinair was waiting to greet your valiant return.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYour journey from Suhn to the Isle of Lorn and back again seemed to have lasted no more than a few days. Yet, to your surprise, you discovered that two whole months had elapsed since the day you first sailed upon the Sea of Dreams. Lord Zinair praised you for the success of your quest. He also informed you that during the time you spent on Lorn a new and sinister threat to the fragile peace of Magnamund had arisen. The precise nature of this threat was revealed when you returned with Lord Zinair to his consulate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a secret chamber of the Dessian consulate, you were able to communicate the success of your mission to Supreme Master {{characterName}} by means of a magical seeing stone. Warmly he praised the skill and courage you had displayed, and he commended you for upholding the highest traditions of the Kai. He told you that he and the New Order were justly proud of your accomplishment and they welcomed the day when you would return to the monastery. {{characterName}} also had some grave news to impart, news that would delay a swift return home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018King Oridon of Siyen has been assassinated,\u2019 he said, sadly. \u2018His only son, Prince Karvas, is the sole heir to the throne of Siyen, but he has lived in exile on the Isle of Sheasu for the past decade. The Kingdom of Siyen is one of our oldest allies. Lord Xavial, the Siyenese High Chancellor, has journeyed here to the monastery to warn that, in the Prince\u2019s absence, the throne is to be claimed by Baron Sadanzo. The Baron is an evil man and he possesses a sorcerous power that has turned the minds of the Siyenese Court. He has won the favour of those who, until the King\u2019s murder, openly denounced him as a heartless warmonger. Lord Xavial fears that the Baron draws his newfound power from the Dark God himself, for never before has Sadanzo possessed such sinister influence. If Sadanzo becomes King, the consequence of his rule will be disastrous for us all. Siyen is one of the richest and most powerful realms in all the southern reaches of Magnamund. If it should fall into the hands of Naar, then war and widespread destruction will surely follow. This is grim news, but all is not yet lost\u2026not if we act swiftly. The Constitution of Siyen decrees that Prince Karvas has, upon the death of his father, 60 days in which to lay claim to his rightful heritage. If he should fail to return in time then Sadanzo will be elected as the new ruler. I have vowed to Lord Xavial that the Kai will not stand idly by and let Siyen become enslaved by an agent of Naar. But time is against us\u2014we must act immediately if we are to thwart Sadanzo\u2019s scheme. Ten days have already passed since King Oridon was murdered. Now only 50 days remain before Harvestmas Day\u2014the day of royal ascendance.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou asked {{characterName}} how you could assist in keeping his pledge to Lord Xavial. His reply sent a shiver tingling down your spine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Prince Karvas must be found. He must also be persuaded to return to Seroa, his homeland capital, to claim his throne before time runs out. You, Grand Master, are closer to the Isle of Sheasu than any other Kai. I must command you to go there and seek him out. Lord Zinair has already made provision for your journey by ship. He will accompany you and assist your mission. The Magicians\u2019 Guild of Toran has also pledged its help. The Guildmaster has dispatched one of his brotherhood\u2014Wizard Acraban\u2014to Sheasu. He travels by skyship and should arrive there in twenty days\u2019 time. You are to rendezvous with Wizard Acraban at the city of Mydnight\u2014the island\u2019s only port. Acraban will help you find the Prince and transport him aboard his flying craft directly to Seroa.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith mixed feelings of pride and trepidation, you accepted the mission and vowed to {{characterName}} that you would do everything in your power to ensure its success. Your resolute promise met with his approval.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018I have faith in you, Grand Master,\u2019 he replied. \u2018The quest you are to undertake upholds the noblest traditions of the Kai. I am confident you will prevail. May Kai and Ishir guide you swiftly to victory over Sadanzo\u2014an agent of Naar.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E"

In the ensuing struggle you knock him unconscious with a blow to his jaw; then you grab the hollow spear and turn it towards the Bakhasians gathered at the end of the street. A trigger lever on the side of the spear fires a projectile and you see it soar through the air to strike the nearest shrine-bearer squarely in the chest. As the man is hurled backwards by the force of its impact, his grip is torn from the platform. It tilts over and the tiger-head idol tumbles from its wooden base to hit the ground with a mighty crash. It shatters in two, releasing a whirling cone of red flame from its hollow core that swiftly engulfs the remaining bearers. In the blink of an eye these men are transformed into smouldering heaps of ash."

Prince Karvas is glad to have left the province of Cavalia behind and he is hopeful that your reception in Varedo will be a more cordial one. The city, and its surrounding region, have always been loyal to the House of Oridon. Its ruler, Baron Lodamos, was a friend and martial advisor to his father, King Oridon.

At first the guards refuse you entry for the gates of Varedo are kept secure during the hours of nightfall. But when Karvas demands to see Guard Captain Dunwayne, the matter is quickly resolved. Karvas and Dunwayne both attended the military academy of Seroa, where they spent seven years together learning the art of soldiering. During this time they became the best of friends. Only when Karvas was forced into exile in distant Sheasu did their friendship lapse. The Prince is delighted to hear that Dunwayne still commands the city guard of Varedo and he awaits his arrival with keen anticipation. When eventually Dunwayne arrives at the gatehouse, theirs is a heart-warming reunion. Karvas quickly tells the guard captain of your need to reach Seroa as swiftly as you are able, and Dunwayne pledges to do all he can to help you. He provides you with fresh horses and escorts you personally through the lamplit streets of the city to the citadel where Baron Lodamos resides. Using his rank and influence, Dunwayne is able to rouse Chamberlain Gant, the Baron\u2019s aide. Gant can scarcely believe his eyes when he comes to meet Karvas. He has his guards escort you to the main hall of the citadel while he goes to wake the Baron and tell him the news. Karvas bids Dunwayne goodnight, for the guard captain must now return to his duties at the perimeter wall, but they agree to meet again soon, once Karvas has been crowned King."

As the cloud passes the crew slowly recover, but you glimpse a fresh danger ahead. The Starstrider is drifting towards two large active fissures running parallel to each other, and a little over 100 feet apart. Sweat streaks your face as you struggle to steer a straight course between these fissures and so avoid the crackling bolts of energy that are hurtling out of their fiery depths."

For centuries the neighbouring lands of Lunarlia and Siyen have been enemies, yet the sudden prospect of a marriage between Prince Karvas and Princess Amarelda promised to put an end to many years of rivalry and bloodshed. At first his father, the King of Siyen, approved of their union. But later he changed his mind and forbade his son to marry her on pain of exile. Karvas defied his father and was forced to leave his homeland. He travelled to Sheasu where he was later joined by his beloved Amarelda. She, too, had disobeyed her father\u2019s command and had been cast out for her act of defiance. Karvas talks fondly of the years they spent here alone together. Then, with sadness, he tells you that she recently fell ill with a fever from which she never recovered.

An eagle-eyed crewman on the forward deck spots a tiny clearing on a wooded peak overlooking a crescent-shaped bay.

You feel sure that you have found the Prince\u2019s retreat and you ask Acraban to bring the skyship down within a mile of the settlement so as to avoid the risk of frightening him away. He complies, and within a matter of minutes the Starstrider is hovering above the tree-line less than a mile from the clearing.

They are, by nature, a secretive community. Any overt interest in the affairs of another is commonly viewed with suspicion and distrust."

This district of Mydnight is crowded with the workshops of skilled artisans and craftsmen\u2014ironsmiths, potters, carpenters, weavers, wheelwrights, and glassblowers to name but a few. Most are honest men seeking refuge from the greedy barons and landlords of their native lands. Some have come to escape their debts, while others have found themselves brought here by some misfortune. The noise that fills this quarter of the city is almost deafening. The ceaseless hammering of iron and copper blends with the cries of sellers to create a reverberating wall of sound."

You commit their location to memory and then hurriedly you descend the stairs to the antechamber below."

He is leading the way out of the ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors swing open and the procession of black-clad figures file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they pass by, you peer around the edge of the crumbling warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of unease makes the skin on the back of your neck prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with shock at what you see."

The riding is easy and the fine weather helps you make good progress. By noon of the third day out of Jaroc you have covered nearly 200 miles and you are feeling in good spirits. The prairie gradually gives way to a region of hilly uplands that lie sandwiched between two mountain ranges. Here you happen upon a rutted track that leaves the prairie and winds through the hills towards a high pass. There are no signposts on this road, but Karvas is familiar with this region and he tells you that it leads to an outpost town called Battle Pass. You are in the land of Lunarlia and for centuries this realm has been the enemy of Siyen\u2014Prince Karvas\u2019 homeland. Many wars have been waged between the two kingdoms and this region has seen countless battles. Karvas pledges to end these wars. When he is crowned King of Siyen he vows that he will seek a lasting peace with the kingdom of Lunarlia."

You let him sleep on for another hour before you are forced to awaken him. A trio of rugged timber workers have arrived in an ox-drawn wagon to collect logs for transportation to the river barges. Unfortunately, they have decided to take the logs behind which you are hiding. As they busy themselves fixing hooks and chains, you and Karvas slip aboard their wagon and cover yourselves with a tarpaulin. Once the loading is complete, the men take their seats at the front of the wagon and set off for the river."
