Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people.

His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights.

These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. {{characterName}}, the leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS\u0026nbsp;5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the demise of the Darklords, peace has reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of {{characterName}} the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS\u0026nbsp;5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of {{characterName}}, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents have helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you have risen swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the year MS\u0026nbsp;5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during {{characterName}}\u2019s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by {{characterName}} and the King\u2019s Army of Sommerlund.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the six years that have elapsed since the defeat of his minions, Naar has endeavoured to enact his vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and they wait quietly in the shadows for the day when they may serve their fell master. One such agent was Lord Vandyan of Eldenora. Guided by Naar, Vandyan sought and found three ancient runes of evil. Empowered by his discoveries, Vandyan summoned a vast army of reptilian warriors\u2014the Vorka\u2014and he used them to conquer and occupy the lands of his peaceful neighbours. Emboldened by his martial successes, Vandyan then carried the war further afield.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy mid-summer of this year his army had overrun much of central Magnamund, including the realm of Lyris\u2014one of Sommerlund\u2019s oldest allies. From war-torn Lyris there arrived at the Kai Monastery an old man called Gwynian the Sage. He was a learned scholar and was revered by the Kai for he had aided {{characterName}} on many occasions in the past. He entreated your leader to help save his country from Vandyan\u2019s horde. Without hesitation, {{characterName}} pledged to mount a Kai crusade to raise the siege of Varetta, its capital city.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Vorka had been the key to Vandyan\u2019s military successes and he had a seemingly endless supply of these reptilian fighters. In order to defeat Vandyan and save Lyris, {{characterName}} knew that he had to cut off Vandyan\u2019s supply of Vorka reinforcements at their source. Gwynian had agents in Duadon, the capital of Eldenora, who had sent word that thousands of Vorka were being created inside the city. This was the source of the enemy\u2019s horde.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGwynian\u2019s agents in Duadon had confirmed that Vandyan\u2019s runes were being kept in the city\u2019s stronghold, a daunting fortress called Skull-Tor. {{characterName}} asked you to travel alone to Duadon to make contact with Gwynian\u2019s agents. They knew a secret route into the fortress and would help you to gain entry. Once inside, you were to find and destroy the runes as quickly as possible. Upon completion of the mission, the agents would assist you to evade Vandyan\u2019s troops. The thought of venturing hundreds of miles behind enemy lines to undertake such a dangerous quest filled you with a sense of foreboding. Yet, you also felt greatly honoured to have been chosen for the mission and you did not flinch from your duty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYour journey to Duadon was fraught with many perils, yet you overcame them all and made contact with Gwynian\u2019s agents. With their help you gained entry to Vandyan\u2019s stronghold of Skull-Tor and destroyed the evil runes, thereby extinguishing the source of the power by which the Vorka horde were permitted to exist. Vandyan\u2019s army dissolved and the Kai were then able to enter Lyris and raise the siege of Varetta.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring your mission in Skull-Tor, you discovered that the Vorka were not the only creatures that Vandyan had summoned by the power of the runes. A demonic entity called Zorkaan the Soultaker had also been brought to Magnamund from his lair upon the Plane of Darkness\u2014the ethereal domain of Naar. Having fought and defeated this creature, you believed that he had perished forever when subsequently you smashed the runes. Sadly, this was not so.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing your victory at Skull-Tor you were met by Guildmaster Banedon, the leader of Sommerlund\u2019s Guild of Magicians, who spirited you away from Duadon aboard his flying ship \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E. Within minutes of your arrival aboard, a route was charted and a course set for the city of Varetta. The journey by air took little more than two hours and, although darkness had fallen, Banedon\u2019s skilled crewmen had little difficulty locating the city. Its siege-damaged walls were ringed with beacons of fire that were visible for fifty miles. As you drew closer, you saw the lifeless remains of the Vorka horde spread out across the plain surrounding Varetta, and the regiments of the allied armies marching proudly towards its gates. The beacons guided Banedon\u2019s craft towards the centre of the city where it was made to hover above the Halls of Learning, Gwynian\u2019s home. Swiftly you were lowered by cage to the grounds of this magnificent building where the New Order Kai were encamped. There you were greeted by the thunderous cheer of your fellow kinsmen, and the proud embrace of {{characterName}} and Gwynian the Sage. It was a joyful and victorious reunion, one that will live forever in your memory and in the legends of the New Order Kai.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENews of your arrival spread quickly through Varetta and you were f\u00EAted by its grateful citizens. By your brave action, the cruel siege of their city had been lifted. Following a night of celebration, {{characterName}} ordered you to return in triumph to the Kai Monastery aboard \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E. He chose to ride home with the New Order and was expected to arrive in a week\u2019s time. Gladly you obeyed your leader\u2019s command, and shortly before noon you waved farewell to your proud brethren from the deck of Banedon\u2019s magnificent flying ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly the next day, you arrived at the Kai Monastery and delivered the glad news of your victory at Skull-Tor. Warmly the garrison praised your achievement and listened in awe when you recounted the details of your perilous mission. You informed them that {{characterName}} and the Kai crusaders were returning from Varetta and would arrive at the monastery in seven days\u2019 time. You were the highest ranking Kai present at the monastery and so you took charge and oversaw preparations for their welcome home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFive days passed and the preparations were completed ahead of schedule. Everyone was looking forward with eager anticipation to their return. It was late that afternoon when a Kai scout called Gold Rain arrived unexpectedly at the monastery. His face and clothes were badly travel-stained, and it was clear from his state of near-exhaustion that he had ridden hard without rest. You were hoping that he had glad tidings, but you soon heard to the contrary; Gold Rain had grave and shocking news to impart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou learned that {{characterName}} had disappeared. During an overnight encampment on the outskirts of Ruanon, your leader had been abducted. Those who witnessed the abduction said that {{characterName}} was engulfed by a whirling black shadow that fell upon him from out of a stormy sky. So swift was the attack that your fellow Grand Masters were unable to prevent him from being carried away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA cold chill ran down your spine as you listened to Gold Rain\u2019s report. His description of the whirling black shadow was identical to the form adopted by Zorkaan the Soultaker. You were filled with a gnawing sense of doubt, a dire fear that the destruction of the rune used by Vandyan to summon Zorkaan did not bring about the fell creature\u2019s demise. Instead, it had trapped Zorkaan upon Magnamund. Immediately you suspected that {{characterName}}\u2019s abduction was an act of revenge. Your Kai Sixth Sense told you that {{characterName}} was still alive and present somewhere upon Magnamund, but you could not determine exactly where that place was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou had achieved a great victory at Duadon, but the shocking news of {{characterName}}\u2019s disappearance cast a deep shadow over your triumph there. You feared that the loss of your illustrious leader was too high a price to pay for the defeat of Vandyan and his Vorka hordes. Your natural instinct was to do everything in your power to find {{characterName}} and release him from his shadowy abductor, but you knew not where to look.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHurriedly you dispatched a rider to Toran and summoned Guildmaster Banedon to an emergency council at the Kai Monastery. He responded swiftly to your summons and arrived within hours aboard \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E. He was accompanied by Lord Rimoah of Dessi, an Elder Magi magician who is also {{characterName}}\u2019s oldest friend and advisor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERimoah confirmed your suspicions that Zorkaan had been summoned to Magnamund by the power of the runes. When you smashed the runes, this entity could not return to the Plane of Darkness from whence it had come. Inadvertently, your action had trapped Zorkaan upon Magnamund. The arrival upon your world of this powerful creature of evil had not gone unnoticed by the Elder Magi. From afar they had sensed Zorkaan\u2019s presence and, through the use of their Old Kingdom magic, Rimoah and his fellow elders had charted his movements. For a short while, following the destruction of the runes, the creature had roamed the planet freely. But his freedom was soon curtailed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELord Rimoah then told you of an evil sorcerer called Xaol. He is a necromancer who dwells in hiding in Gazad Helkona, a former Darklord city-fortress located in the desolate wastes of northern Skaror. Xaol is also an agent of Naar who, since the demise of the Darklords, has patiently awaited the chance to serve his fell master. During the days before {{characterName}}\u2019s abduction, Rimoah and the Elder Magi detected streams of psychic communication coursing between Gazad Helkona and the Plane of Darkness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Naar was transmitting to Xaol the secrets of a Ritual of Binding by which the freed spirit of Zorkaan could once again be enslaved,\u2019 said Rimoah. \u2018We now know that this ritual was enacted successfully by Xaol in the stronghold of Gazad Helkona.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Naar\u2019s insatiable thirst for revenge is a menace that {{characterName}} has had to live with since the day he destroyed the Dark God\u2019s champions,\u2019 said Guildmaster Banedon. \u2018He maintains his vigilance against the constant threat of assassination by the agents of Naar, yet it seems he\u2019s been caught off-guard during the long march home to Sommerlund.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Through the ritual enacted by Xaol, Naar has gained control over Zorkaan,\u2019 replied Rimoah. \u2018He sent this creature to assassinate {{characterName}} at a Kai encampment near Ruanon, yet the attempt was unsuccessful. Zorkaan failed to kill {{characterName}}\u2026but he was able to subdue and abduct him.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018So where is {{characterName}} now?\u2019 you asked, anxiously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018He is imprisoned in Gazad Helkona,\u2019 replied Rimoah, \u2018and he is in great peril. Only his Supreme Master Disciplines and the power of the Sommerswerd, his magical blade, have spared him from death by the hand of Naar\u2019s foul creation. Your leader is brave and resourceful, but I fear that Zorkaan\u2019s frequent attacks will weaken and eventually destroy {{characterName}} unless he is rescued quickly.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESelflessly you volunteered to attempt such a rescue. Rimoah and Banedon were impressed by your courage and your confidence, and readily they agreed to help you achieve this difficult task. Rimoah informed you that Gazad Helkona is occupied by Xaol and his cohorts, which comprise Hammerland bandits and remnants of the army of Darklord Chlanzor, the former ruler of this city-fortress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018The stronghold is located in a remote volcanic region, surrounded by a petrified forest from which it takes its name. It is a difficult place to reach and assault by force,\u2019 said Rimoah.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018But where an army may fail, a single Kai may triumph,\u2019 interjected Banedon, wisely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt length you discussed the rescue and agreed upon a plan of action. Banedon will transport you aboard his flying ship \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E to a valley in the Shezar Hills, situated fifty miles to the south of Gazad Helkona. Here you will disembark and then approach the fortress on foot. Banedon will remain aboard his flying ship, safely out of sight of Xaol\u2019s lookouts, where he will await a telepathic signal from {{characterName}} to confirm his rescue. Upon receiving this signal, he will bring \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E into the centre of Gazad Helkona in order to collect you both. If you are unable to complete your mission to set {{characterName}} free, you must make your own way back to the flying ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring your mission, Lord Rimoah and the Elder Magi will use their combined powers to disrupt the channel of communication that exists between Naar and his agent Xaol. Rimoah is confident that this action will serve to prevent Xaol from detecting the arrival of \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E, and it will also help to keep secret your approach to his grim stronghold.\u003C/p\u003E"

Inside the entrance to this gloomy passage you discover a niche in the wall. It contains a small crystal decanter of green fluid, festooned with cobwebs. Cautiously you pull its stopper to sniff the contents, and you are pleasantly surprised to discover that it contains a tincture of Laumspur. It is old and stale, but it still possesses some of its healing powers. (This Decanter contains the equivalent of two doses of Laumspur. Each dose will restore 4 ENDURANCE points when swallowed after combat. If you wish to keep the Decanter, it will occupy only one space in your Backpack.)"
