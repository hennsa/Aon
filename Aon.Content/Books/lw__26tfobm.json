Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people.

His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden).

These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. {{characterName}}, the supreme leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of the Darklord attack upon the Kai. As a young initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. Twenty years later he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the destruction of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the demise of the Darklords, peace has reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of {{characterName}} the ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and a New Order has been firmly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS\u0026nbsp;5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of {{characterName}}, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. Over the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents have helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you have risen swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement that has brought great honour upon you and your family.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the year MS\u0026nbsp;5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during {{characterName}}\u2019s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by {{characterName}} and the King\u2019s Army of Sommerlund.\u003Csup\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022#tssf-1-foot\u0022 name=\u0022tssf-1\u0022\u003E1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the seven years that have elapsed since the defeat of his minions, Naar has sought vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and quietly they wait in the shadows for the day when they may serve their fell master. One such agent was Lord Vandyan of Eldenora. Guided by Naar, Vandyan sought and found three ancient runes of evil. Empowered by his discoveries, Vandyan summoned a vast army of reptilian warriors\u2014the Vorka\u2014which he used to conquer and occupy the lands of his peaceful neighbours. Emboldened by his martial successes, Vandyan overran much of central Magnamund, including the realm of Lyris\u2014one of Sommerlund\u2019s oldest allies. In response to a plea for help from Lyris, {{characterName}} mounted a Kai crusade to raise the Vorka siege of Varetta, its capital city.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring this crusade, you undertook a vital mission behind enemy lines that turned the tide of the whole campaign. Alone, you infiltrated Vandyan\u2019s daunting fortress of Skull-Tor and destroyed the three runes, thereby extinguishing the source of the power by which the Vorka horde were permitted to exist. Vandyan\u2019s army dissolved on the battlefield and the Kai were able to raise the siege of Varetta.\u003Csup\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022#tssf-2-foot\u0022 name=\u0022tssf-2\u0022\u003E2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring your mission in Skull-Tor, you discovered that the Vorka were not the only creatures that Vandyan had summoned by the power of the runes. A demonic entity called Zorkaan the Soultaker had also been brought to Magnamund from its lair upon the Plane of Darkness\u2014the ethereal domain of Naar. Having fought and defeated this creature, you believed that it had perished forever when subsequently you smashed the runes. Sadly, this was not so. After celebrating the battlefield victory at Varetta, {{characterName}} ordered you to return in triumph to the Kai Monastery aboard the flying ship \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E. He chose to ride with his New Order crusaders and they were expected to arrive home a week later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter five days, a Kai scout arrived unexpectedly at the monastery with shocking news to impart. {{characterName}} had disappeared. Those who witnessed the abduction said that he was engulfed by a whirling black shadow that fell upon him from out of a stormy sky. So swift was the attack that your fellow Grand Masters were unable to prevent him from being carried away. The scout\u2019s description of the whirling black shadow was identical to the form adopted by Zorkaan the Soultaker. The destruction of the rune used by Vandyan to summon Zorkaan had not brought about the creature\u2019s demise after all: it had trapped the creature upon Magnamund.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou had achieved a great victory at Skull-Tor, but the shocking news of {{characterName}}\u2019s abduction cast a shadow over your triumph there. Hurriedly you summoned Guildmaster Banedon, the leader of Sommerlund\u2019s Guild of Magicians, to an emergency council at the Kai Monastery. He responded swiftly to your summons and arrived within hours aboard his flying craft \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E. He was accompanied by Lord Rimoah of Dessi, an Elder Magi magician who is also {{characterName}}\u2019s oldest friend and advisor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERimoah informed you that Zorkaan\u2019s arrival upon Magnamund had not gone unnoticed by the Elder Magi. From afar they had sensed the creature\u2019s presence and, through the use of their Old Kingdom magic, Rimoah and his fellow elders had charted its movements. Rimoah told you of an evil sorcerer called Xaol who was in hiding in Gazad Helkona, a former Darklord city-fortress located in the desolate wastes of northern Skaror. This vile necromancer was a known agent of Naar. During the days before {{characterName}}\u2019s abduction, Rimoah and the Elder Magi had detected streams of psychic communication coursing between Gazad Helkona and the Plane of Darkness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Naar was transmitting to Xaol the secrets of a Ritual of Binding by which the freed spirit of Zorkaan could be enslaved,\u2019 said Rimoah. \u2018This ritual was enacted successfully in the stronghold of Gazad Helkona. Through Xaol, Naar has gained control over Zorkaan. He sent this creature to assassinate {{characterName}}, yet the attempt was unsuccessful. Zorkaan failed to kill {{characterName}}\u2026but he was able to subdue and kidnap him.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERimoah informed you that your leader was being held prisoner in Gazad Helkona. By the use of his Supreme Master Disciplines and the power of the Sommerswerd, his magical blade, {{characterName}} had survived death at the hand of Naar\u2019s foul creation. \u2018Your leader is brave and resourceful,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I fear that Zorkaan\u2019s frequent attacks will weaken and eventually destroy him unless he is rescued quickly.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESelflessly you volunteered to attempt the rescue. Rimoah and Banedon, impressed by your courage and your confidence, readily agreed to help you achieve your difficult mission and together you formulated a plan of action. Banedon transported you aboard \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E to a remote valley south of Gazad Helkona, from where you approached the fortress on foot.

It has been a peaceful and rewarding time for you at the Kai Monastery, a period in which you have devoted yourself to the training of new recruits. Such has been the success of your tutelage that you have come to be greatly revered by your students and your peers. Yet, lately, you have felt a longing to venture abroad once more, to test your courage and your battle skills in the ineluctable war against Evil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly one morning, you glimpsed a golden eagle leave its nest in the frost-covered timberland that stretches beyond the window of your private chamber. As you watched this majestic creature soar above the tree-line, you were reminded of the daring aerial escape that you had made from Gazad Helkona aboard Banedon\u2019s skycraft. Then you felt a tingle of premonition at the nape of your neck when you noticed a distant speck in the clear azure sky. This speck grew larger until you were able to discern the distinctive outline of \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E approaching from the north. Hurriedly you left your chamber and went to the monastery training park where a small group of Kai Lords had gathered in expectation. As the sleek skyship was made to hover overhead, a boarding cage was lowered to the frost-hardened ground and out stepped an unexpected visitor\u2014Lord Rimoah of Dessi. You exchanged greetings and he requested an immediate audience with {{characterName}}. From his sombre expression you could tell that he had grave and urgent news to impart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou escorted Lord Rimoah personally to {{characterName}}\u2019s chambers, located beneath the Tower of the Sun, the monastery\u2019s commanding citadel. Before you could excuse yourself and leave the vault, {{characterName}} asked you to stay to listen to what the venerable magician had come to say. Lord Rimoah nodded his benign approval.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Dwarf King Ryvin of Bor is in desperate need of our aid, my lords,\u2019 began Rimoah, earnestly. \u2018An ancient horror has been awoken in the depths of his subterranean kingdom, and now it threatens to destroy his realm. The Drodarin race may be doomed unless we are able to overcome this creature\u2026and swiftly.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELord Rimoah informed you that recent excavations in the lowest levels of the vast underground kingdom of Bor had disturbed the Shom\u2019zaa. This powerful entity was entombed by the Elder Magi during their 1,000-year war against Agarash the Damned\u2014Naar\u2019s first champion of evil. {{characterName}} lowered his eyes and shook his head in disbelief upon hearing Rimoah\u2019s words.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018I understood that dwarf lore expressly forbade such deep mining, for fear that the Shom\u2019zaa and its minions might be released. How could such a thing have been allowed to occur?\u2019 he said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Greed is to blame, my lord,\u2019 replied Rimoah, sadly, \u2018\u2026the greed of King Ryvin\u2019s elder son, the Crown Prince Leomin. He alone was responsible for the excavations that opened the way to this ancient horror.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELord Rimoah informed you that only five days have elapsed since the Shom\u2019zaa was released, yet already the creature and its Agarashi minions have taken control of the lower levels of the kingdom. \u2018Bitter fighting rages in the tunnels and chambers of Bor as King Ryvin\u2019s army struggles to contain the Shom\u2019zaa and its horde,\u2019 he said. \u2018They are being sorely pressed, for the enemy have captured their armouries and equipped themselves for the fight. Ryvin has lost control of the tunnels leading to his throne chamber, where Leomin and his younger brother, Prince Torfan, are now trapped and besieged, along with the remnants of their personal guard.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} was disturbed to hear that the Throne Chamber of Bor was under attack, for it houses the fabled Throne of Andarin. This grand seat contains a gem of power that was bestowed upon the Drodarin dwarves of Bor by the Goddess Ishir. Its divine radiance provides the dwarves with a unique energy that enables them to grow their crops deep underground, without the need for direct sunlight. If the Throne of Andarin is destroyed then the crops will surely fail and famine will beset Bor, with disastrous consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Repeated attempts to break the siege of the throne chamber have failed, and the morale of Ryvin\u2019s army is now dangerously low,\u2019 said Rimoah. \u2018I\u2019ve heard tell that even the Dwarf Lords and the War-thanes, the \u00E9lite of Ryvin\u2019s army, hold that Prince Leomin\u2019s greed has sealed their fate. If such talk is true, and the Shom\u2019zaa conquers Bor, then our hopes for a lasting peace in Magnamund will be ruined. The fall of Bor will give Naar a base of power at the very heart of Magnamund. There he will be able to muster his agents, spawn his vile abominations, and attempt once more to conquer our world.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018But what can be done to save Bor before it is too late?\u2019 asked {{characterName}}, anxiously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018King Ryvin lacks the means to destroy this enemy,\u2019 replied Rimoah, gravely. \u2018Nevertheless, the means exist. The Shom\u2019zaa is especially vulnerable to magic of the Old Kingdom. It is the magic that we used to entrap and entomb the creature millennia ago.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a pocket of his flowing robes, Rimoah took out a spherical crystal and held it in the cupped palm of his hand. Its multi-faceted surface radiated beams of golden light which shimmered and sparkled with a supernatural brilliance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018A Sun-crystal,\u2019 said {{characterName}}.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Yes, my lord,\u2019 replied Rimoah, reverently. \u2018By the skilful use of the power contained within this sphere it is possible that we may defeat the Shom\u2019zaa and its minions, and thereby spare the kingdom of Bor from the tyrannical rule of Naar. We of the Elder Magi have crafted the means to defeat the Shom\u2019zaa, but in all Magnamund only the Kai have the ability and courage that is needed to take this goodly weapon and use it to its full effect.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} approached Rimoah and took the Sun-crystal from his outstretched palm. Then he turned to face you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018We have been called upon to undertake a difficult and dangerous mission, Grand Master,\u2019 he said. \u2018You have proven your bravery and skill beyond all doubt, and truly you have earned the right to refuse this quest with honour. Yet I sense that you hunger for the heat of battle and the challenge of the quest, and so I offer this mission to you. Will you venture to Bor and confront the bane that now threatens to destroy our dwarven allies?\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Yes, my lord, I will,\u2019 you replied, without a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u2018For the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Kai, I am proud to accept the quest.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E"
