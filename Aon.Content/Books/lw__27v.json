Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the {{characterName}} books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EFive years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EIn 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E\u2014the first {{characterName}} interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson\u2019s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and \u003Ccite\u003EFlight from the Dark\u003C/cite\u003E was first published in 1984.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThis first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe\u2019s first book laid the foundations for the future of the {{characterName}} series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n   \u003Cp\u003EThe {{characterName}} series ended after 28 books and 14 years.

Brian Williams was Joe\u2019s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe\u2019s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the \u003Ccite\u003E{{characterName}}\u003C/cite\u003E series.

As a young initiate he stood amid the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. Twenty years later he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the destruction of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly, their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war, allowing the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of {{characterName}} the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and a New Order was established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS\u0026nbsp;5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old, you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of {{characterName}}, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. Your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by years of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and swiftly you rose through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement that has brought great honour upon you and your family.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the year MS\u0026nbsp;5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during {{characterName}}\u2019s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund.

Forbidden excavations in the lowest levels of the kingdom had awoken and released the Shom\u2019zaa\u2014a supernatural creature entombed by Magnamund\u2019s earliest magicians, the Elder Magi, during their ancient war against Naar\u2019s legendary champion: Agarash the Damned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi, travelled with you to Bor aboard a wondrous flying ship called \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E and, with his help, you were able to defeat the Shom\u2019zaa and save your Drodarin allies from destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThree months after you returned from Bor, Lord Rimoah came to the Kai Monastery aboard \u003Ccite\u003ECloud-dancer\u003C/cite\u003E. His visit was unexpected and you sensed at once that something was wrong. {{characterName}} summoned you to his chamber where, with mounting dread, you listened to Lord Rimoah\u2019s account of events in Southern Magnamund that threaten to destroy the fragile peace of that continent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Elder Magi had received word from King Karvas of Siyen that Autarch Sejanoz, the evil ruler of Bhanar, had secretly dispatched a squad of his Imperial Guards into the Doomlands of Naaros. At first, neither the King nor the Elders could fathom a reason why the Autarch had done this. The Doomlands are one of the most inhospitable regions in all of Magnamund, a barren wasteland of ash and cinders that once was the domain of Agarash the Damned. At its centre stood his mighty fortress-city of Naaros. Yet, following his defeat by the Elder Magi, all that remains of it now is a titanic chasm of molten lava and heat-fused rock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFearing for the security of his southern borderlands, King Karvas sent a group of \u00E9lite Siyenese rangers into the Doomlands to spy on the Autarch\u2019s men in the hope of discovering their true purpose. When, after six weeks, nothing was heard from the group, the King and his court assumed they had perished. Then a few days later, Karvas received word unexpectedly from his missing men. They had tracked the squad of the Autarch\u2019s Imperial Guard deep into the Doomlands, and they had observed them excavating an unmarked burial mound near to the ruins of Naaros. And it was here that they were to witness a chilling discovery, for buried beneath the mound lay the Claw of Naar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Claw of Naar is an ancient wand of power that was crafted by the evil God himself, and used by Agarash the Damned during his conquest of Magnamund. Legend held that it had been lost forever in the molten ruin of Naaros, but now it had resurfaced, and its return boded trouble for the peaceable nations bordering upon the Autocracy of Bhanar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rangers reported that the Autarch\u2019s squad were returning to Bhanar with the Claw in their possession. Their chosen route would take them through the Southern Dammerdon Mountains and so the rangers went ahead to hide themselves in Sunderer Pass where they intended to await their arrival. Their plan was to ambush the squad in the narrow confines of the pass and steal away the Claw. However, the ranger leader was fearful that the power of the Claw might overwhelm his small group. He requested of his King that help be sent urgently. Karvas responded to his plea by seeking the aid of the Elder Magi, and upon hearing of the situation, Lord Rimoah readily agreed to assist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018In turn, {{characterName}}, I have come this day to ask for the help of the Kai,\u2019 said Rimoah. \u2018We of the Elder Magi have the power and the means to destroy the Claw of Naar, but only when we have that accursed object in our possession. To secure the Claw will require skills and courage that only the Kai possess. And so, I come here seeking your aid, Supreme Master.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018It will not be an easy task,\u2019 replied {{characterName}}, thoughtfully, \u2018but we have the advantage of both speed and surprise. Sunderer Pass is no more than a day\u2019s journey away by skyship.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Aye,\u2019 replied Rimoah, \u2018but we must depart this afternoon if we are to be certain of reaching the pass before the arrival of the Autarch\u2019s squad.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E{{characterName}} slowly turned to face you. \u2018I am tempted to accept this challenge myself, Grand Master,\u2019 he said, as he held you with his unblinking gaze. \u2018But, alas, I must attend a War Council tomorrow at the King\u2019s Court in Holmgard. Will you journey to Bhanar in my stead and help Lord Rimoah to capture the Claw of Naar?\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Yes, my lord,\u2019 you replied, without hesitation. \u2018For the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Kai, I am proud to accept this task.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E"

Turning towards the rocks that block the mountain pass, he points the Claw at the base and lets loose a third blast of dark flame which blows a big hole in the heaped debris.
