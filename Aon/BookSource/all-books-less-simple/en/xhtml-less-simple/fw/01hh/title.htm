   <p>You are Cal Phoenix, the Freeway Warrior, champion and protector of Dallas Colony One. A murderous gang of HAVOC clansmen, led by the psychotic Mad Dog Michigan, are bent on destroying your fragile colony as it crosses the wastelands of Texas on the first stage of a life-or-death exodus to the California coast. These bike-riding clansmen are a formidable enemy: armed, cunning, and extremely dangerous, capable of launching a lightning raid at any time, day or night. You will need all your wits about you if you are to defend your people and reach your destination intact!</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels and the Freeway Warrior adventure books, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


   <p><strong>Melvyn Grant</strong> was born in London, England, and expressed a talent for art from a very early age. He became the only student to attend The Brassey Institute School of Fine Arts at the early age of twelve. Although his approach to painting is firmly rooted in traditional Fine Art, he finds much more excitement in the world of High-end Fantasy Illustration. Melvyn maintains a <a href="http://www.melgrant.com/">website</a> showcasing his art.</p>

<h2><a name="dtd">Dateline to Disaster</a></h2>

<dl>
<dt>1990–1998</dt>
<dd>Rise of global terrorism on an unprecedented scale. Political violence funded by organized crime syndicate called HAVOC—The Hijack, Assassination, and Violent Opposition Consortium.</dd>
<dt>1998–2003</dt>
<dd>The governments of many small and impoverished nations fall into the hands of HAVOC. International terrorists receive arms, training, and shelter in these ‘Badlands’.</dd>
<dt>2003–2008</dt>
<dd>Raids on oil and gas installations, assassinations, and the kidnapping of prominent world statesmen become commonplace as HAVOC attempts to terrorize the civilized world into submission. Despite public outrage and growing international tension, the major powers steadfastly refuse to give in to HAVOC’s demands.</dd>
<dt>2008</dt>
<dd>President of the United States and General Secretary of Supreme Soviet both assassinated at emergency summit meeting. US, USSR, and major European nations create the World Defence League and declare war on HAVOC. The Badlands are invaded, key HAVOC bases destroyed, and thousands of HAVOC agents are captured.</dd>
<dt>2009</dt>
<dd>HAVOC leaders imprisoned for life in ‘Deep Pens’—maximum security gaols located deep underground—to prevent their escape or release by HAVOC agents still at large.</dd>
<dt>2010</dt>
<dd>New leadership emerges to unify the scattered remnants of HAVOC and plan revenge.</dd>
<dt>2011</dt>
<dd>A WDL train transporting seventeen 100-kiloton nuclear warheads, slated to be neutralized and dismantled, is attacked by HAVOC agents. The train is destroyed and its deadly cargo stolen.</dd>
<dt>2012 New Year’s Day</dt>
<dd>HAVOC hijacks a WDL news satellite and broadcasts a chilling ultimatum. They have planted the seventeen stolen warheads in major cities throughout the US, USSR, and Europe. They call for the immediate release of all HAVOC agents held in Deep Pens, plus the payment of $2 trillion in gold bullion, or they will trigger the warheads one by one until their demands are met in full. A twenty-four hour deadline is set. WDL leaders declare an emergency and request that the deadline be extended. HAVOC refuses.</dd>
<dt>2nd January</dt>
<dd>First warhead detonated at Brie Nuclear Energy Plant, ten miles south of Paris, France. Blast and radioactive fallout claim millions of lives. HAVOC repeats its demand and extends deadline by twenty-four hours.</dd>
<dt>3rd January ‘The Day’</dt>
<dd>World Defence League agents discover location of HAVOC command headquarters on an island in the South Pacific Ocean. Immediately orders are given to infiltrate and destroy the HQ and its occupants. The assault is swift and decisive; the complex is quickly overrun and its inhabitants are killed. Yet, ironically, as the news of this victory is being relayed around the world, HAVOC enacts its ultimate revenge. A transmitter hidden on the island, fitted with a time-delay mechanism, clicks on, sending its high-frequency radio signal to a communications satellite orbiting the earth. This signal is amplified and returned to earth where, simultaneously, it triggers the remaining nuclear warheads. The initial explosions set off a disastrous chain reaction that feeds on civil and military nuclear installations all across the northern hemisphere. Hundreds of millions of people are killed within days, and many more perish during the years that follow, falling victim to the lingering radioactivity and the severe climatic changes that affect the earth.</dd>
<dt>2012–2019</dt>
<dd>Gale force winds sweep across the world, carrying enormous amounts of dust into the upper atmosphere and preventing much sunlight from reaching the earth’s surface. Temperatures plummet, deterring survivors from remaining above ground. Communications are disrupted by gamma radiation, making all radio, cable, and satellite contact impossible. Small colonies of survivors develop in total isolation from one another during these years of darkness.</dd>
<dt>2019–2020</dt>
<dd>Gradually, the dust storms die down and the sun penetrates the atmosphere, thawing the earth’s frozen surface. Radiation has decayed to tolerable levels, and survivors emerge to reclaim what little remains of the world they once knew.</dd>

<h2><a name="calstory">Cal’s Story</a></h2>

<p>You are Cal Phoenix, a survivor, born on Thanksgiving in the year 2000 AD. When you cast your mind back to the time before ‘The Day’, you recall your two brothers and your sister, your parents’ house in California, and summer vacations spent cruising the blue Pacific off Catalina Island aboard your father’s boat. They are your fondest memories, yet your most vivid recollections are of winter vacations, when the family would drive to Dallas to spend Christmas with Uncle Jonas and Aunt Betty-Ann. Of all your Texan Christmases, the 2011 visit was the most memorable. It was also the last time you saw your family alive.</p>
<p>Your parents had decided to cancel the trip to Dallas that year. The oil shortage had pushed up the price of gasolene to $30 a gallon, and only the rich could afford to drive long distances, even in cars equipped with solar-pacs. You were so disappointed when you heard the news that you decided to walk the 1300 miles to Dallas, and would have done so had your father not caught up with you three miles from home. Then, when Uncle Jonas and Aunt Betty-Ann got to hear of it, they fixed it with your parents so that you at least could spend Christmas with them at their ranch near Denton.</p>
<p>From the moment they met your charter flight at Addison Airport you knew it was going to be a vacation to remember. Uncle Jonas was an oilman. He had been one ever since he graduated from the University of Texas in ’95 with a degree in geology. Earlier that summer he had been put in charge of construction at a shale-oil mine near Austin, the very first of its kind in Texas, and as a special Christmas treat he promised to take you on a guided tour of the whole underground complex.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small1.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>On New Year’s Day 2012, the three of you started out early on the road to your uncle’s mine, located on the Austin Chalk, over 200 miles south of Dallas. The trip would take at least two days, with an overnight stop in Waco, for, in an effort to conserve energy, the Federal government had imposed a speed restriction of fifteen miles per hour on all state highways. It was a slow journey, and despite the sombre radio bulletins that gave news of HAVOC’s latest threats, you can still remember your excitement at the thought of exploring those tunnels deep below the earth.</p>
<p>Your arrival at the mine was met by a military patrol, posted there by the World Defence League. The job of the patrol was to prevent sabotage; oil installations all over the world had become one of HAVOC’s primary targets in their campaign of terror. The mine was officially closed for the New Year’s recess but Uncle Jonas had right of access at all times and, after checking his papers, the patrol allowed you in. It was a massive complex and, for security reasons, it was totally self-supporting. A central shaft serviced the many working levels to which there were attached laboratories, workshops, and even refineries for processing the precious crude oil after it had been extracted from the rock. Uncle Jonas was explaining the function of these refineries, 300 feet below the surface, when it happened.</p>
<p>The ground shuddered when the shock waves from the first distant explosions reached the mine, and you remember thinking that it must be the start of an earthquake, the like of which you had experienced many times at home in California. But as the levels nearest the surface began to collapse and the central shaft filled with falling rubble, you realized the awful truth. The unthinkable had happened.</p>
<p>At first there was no way of telling the extent of the surface devastation. Below ground, the safety generators had automatically switched into operation when the main power supply failed, and the tremors faded quickly, encouraging your aunt and uncle to believe that the damage above was superficial. Uncle Jonas was confident that the military would mount a rescue operation and that you would be brought out within a few days—a week at the most. Aunt Betty-Ann was also optimistic. After all, there were emergency supplies, enough to feed 200 men for a whole month. Little did she know that the three of you would end up consuming all of those supplies, or that the mine would become your home, your shelter, and your prison for the next eight years of your lives.</p>
<p>It was a month after ‘The Day’ when the three of you accepted that there would never be a rescue operation. Many days had been spent in silence, hoping and praying for the sounds of excavation or a voice on the radio link to the surface. But all that could be heard was the static crackle of the gamma radiation which was blanketing the earth. Uncle Jonas proposed that an attempt be made to reach the surface by tunnelling through the blocked central shaft. It was an awesomely dangerous feat, to dig vertically through 300 feet of compressed concrete rubble and twisted steel girders, but there was no other way you could ever hope to escape from the mine. Progress was painfully slow but the work gave you all a sense of purpose, a reason to go on, even though you feared what could be awaiting you on the surface.</p>
<p>Those years spent in the mine taught you invaluable lessons in survival. Uncle Jonas showed you how to refine gasolene from crude oil to keep the generators alive; to coax fresh water from porous rock; to manufacture spare parts in order to maintain vital machinery. Aunt Betty-Ann, who had at one time been a nurse and a high school teacher in Denton County, attended to your education and made sure that you stayed fit and healthy. Their love and support enabled you to grow during those dark days underground despite the enormous sense of loss you felt for your parents, brothers, and sister. You vowed then that one day you would repay their kindness by protecting and caring for them.</p>
<p>It was early September in the year 2019 when finally you broke through to the surface. Aunt Betty-Ann was convinced that radiation levels would still be dangerously high, and at first she was against leaving the mine. But, during the last few months of your incarceration, the static that had always jammed the radio wavelengths had gradually cleared, and Uncle Jonas was able to persuade her that this meant it was now safe to live above ground.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small8.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>When you first emerged from the mine, you thought you were on the surface of another planet. Surely this could not be Earth? Few structures had survived the blizzards and intense cold that had swept around the world in the years following ‘The Day’, and now, after the dust had settled and the sun returned, the once-fertile plains of Austin resembled little more than a desert of parched and broken rock, littered with the artefacts of an absent civilization. During the first few days, when you set out to explore this wilderness, it was easy to believe that you were the only survivors. But on the morning of the fifth day, Uncle Jonas made a chance radio contact with a family called Ewell who were living near the ruins of McKinney, thirty miles north of Dallas. They told him that they had been in touch with a handful of other groups who had managed somehow to survive the holocaust. Most were isolated, unable to move due to lack of fuel, food, or water. They had urged those who could travel to join them in McKinney, to start a new community, and some were already on their way. Your uncle and aunt also accepted their invitation. McKinney was not very far from Denton, and they were curious to see if anything remained of their ranch. They planned to return home, salvage whatever they could that might be of use, and then move on to McKinney. The Ewells were enthusiastic, but they warned that not everyone who had survived wanted to establish a new community. The ruins of Dallas and Fort Worth were controlled by gangs of criminals who fought with each other and terrorized anyone seeking to reestablish law and order. They advised you to avoid them at all costs when travelling north.</p>
<p>Interstate Freeway 35 was the only highway still intact amid the devastation that surrounded the mine. It offered a direct route home to Denton, if only transportation could be found, for Uncle Jonas considered conditions far too dangerous to attempt such a long journey on foot. It took more than a week to discover a vehicle that was still serviceable. It was an old school bus, one that had been parked in an underground lot and had survived the years of sub-zero blizzards. With a few new parts, a tankful of gas, and a lot of hard work it was eventually brought back to life.</p>
<p>Provisions, including a small generator, were hoisted out of the mine and stowed aboard before you began the journey back to the ranch. The noisy old bus bumped along the rock-strewn freeway that stretched northward across an empty sea of dust. It was a harrowing sight. Hardly a trace remained of what were once thriving communities, and the once-populous cities of Temple and Waco had barely enough buildings still standing to qualify as small towns.</p>
<p>It was not until you reached the outskirts of Fort Worth that you encountered signs of human habitation. The road ahead was blocked by a line of wrecked autos, and at your approach a group of hard faced men and women, clad in composite costumes of leather and rivetted steel, suddenly popped up from behind this barricade. Uncle Jonas was suspicious and slowed the bus almost to a halt. Suddenly they produced handguns and rifles and began to take aim at the windshield, and he knew it was not the time to stop to ask for directions! He told you and Aunt Betty-Ann to brace yourselves; then he stamped his foot on the gas and drove the bus straight through the wall of cars, scattering the punks like ten-pins in a strike. The bus was shot at many times as it sped through Fort Worth, but the street gangs had been caught out and you managed to escape from the ruined city before they could give chase.</p>
<p>When you got to Denton you discovered that the ranch, like all the other nearby dwellings, had been reduced to a heap of broken bricks and shattered timbers. The sight greatly upset your aunt, and Uncle Jonas felt it better not to stop but to continue overland to McKinney. It was easy to find where the Ewells lived, for their ranch was the only place in town that was still standing. It looked more like an old frontier post than a ranch, with its fortified perimeter wall, lookout posts, and stake-filled moat. But, after your brush with the citizens of Fort Worth, it was easy to understand the need for these defences.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small4.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>‘Pop’ Ewell, the seventy-year-old grandfather of the Ewell family, was the leader of this small colony of survivors; it was he who had urged Uncle Jonas to join them when they had first made radio contact. The colony numbered less than a dozen at the time of your arrival, yet as the airwaves became clearer, soon this number had more than doubled to twenty-five. It was decided that a name was needed to identify the settlement. The name ‘Dallas Colony One’ was adopted—‘DC1’ for short—and from that day on everyone worked hard to make DC1 a secure haven for those seeking refuge from the hostile wastelands and marauding city gangs.</p>
<p>‘Cutter’ Jacks was one such refugee. Before the holocaust he had been chief mechanic at the International Grand Prix Circuit near Lake Dallas, and his incredible skill and knowledge of engines was soon to prove invaluable to the colony. He taught you how to drive, and from a pile of old wrecks that you helped him salvage from the circuit he built you a powerful, customized car. You used it to patrol the highways north of the city, keeping a lookout for gangs of city punks who frequently mounted raids to steal or destroy DC1’s supplies. ‘Cutter’ also taught you to shoot, and it was your prowess with a gun and your skill behind the wheel that was to earn you the begrudging respect of your enemies who took to calling you ‘Freeway Warrior’.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small5.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Six months after you arrived at DC1, the colony was faced with a major crisis. A heat wave was causing a drought that threatened to destroy the food supply. Crops were failing and the colony’s artesian well—its only source of uncontaminated water—was beginning to dry up. The drought was also provoking more attacks from the city punks who were desperate for food and water. Their common need united them and they posed a very real threat to the security of DC1.</p>
<p>It was the last day of May 2020 when Pop Ewell made radio contact with another colony who were based in the city of Big Spring, 300 miles west of McKinney. It appeared that their situation was completely the reverse of DC1’s: they had plenty of food and water but they were desperately short of fuel. They told of their contact with survivors in Tucson, Arizona, who were also without fuel. The Tucson colony reported that the territories west of the mountains of the Sierra Nevada had been spared the worst effects of the radioactive blizzards that had devastated the rest of the country and, miraculously, much of southern California was still widely populated. It had survived the last eight years virtually intact. When you heard the news you could hardly believe your ears. Perhaps your family were alive. You might be reunited after all!</p>
<p>Pop Ewell called for a meeting to decide how best to deal with the crisis now facing DC1. Everyone agreed that to stay at McKinney would lead to eventual death, either slowly from starvation or suddenly at the hands of the murderous city gangs. The only option open to DC1 was to try to reach California; only there lay any real hope for the future of the colony. Your decision was relayed to the survivors at Big Spring and a deal was struck to rendezvous with them as soon as possible. DC1 would exchange fuel for food and water, and together they would join up with the Tucson colony for the final journey to California.</p>
<p>Preparations began almost immediately. Morale was so high that a heady sense of adventure and optimism enveloped everyone. Few guessed just how fraught with danger the journey would be.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>Before embarking on your adventure, you must first determine your personal characteristics and the weapons and provisions with which you are equipped. An <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> has been supplied on which to record and amend these details as the adventure unfolds.</p>
<p>Your personal characteristics comprise two basic attributes: <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small>. To discover your initial <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small>, take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero. Add 10 to the number you have picked and write the total in the <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (for example, if your pencil falls on the number 5 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, you have a <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> total of 15). When you fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, your <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> will be measured against that of your enemy, so a high score in this section is desirable.</p>
<p>To discover your <small>ENDURANCE</small> level, repeat the process, but this time add 20 to the number you have picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (for example, if your pencil falls on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, you have a total <small>ENDURANCE</small> score of 28). If you are wounded in combat, or injured at any other time during your adventure, you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If, at any time, your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. You can regain lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during the course of the adventure, but your <small>ENDURANCE</small> level can never rise above your initial score.</p>
<h3><a name="sskills">Survival Skills</a></h3>

<p>Ever since the day you returned to the surface, you have endeavoured to develop your skills and natural instincts fully in order to best defend yourself and your colony.</p>
<p>Listed on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> are your five basic Survival Skills:</p>
<h4><a name="driving">Driving</a></h4>

<p>Your ability to control powered vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks.</p>
<h4><a name="shooting">Shooting</a></h4>

<p>Your familiarity and experience in the use of missile weapons, such as pistols, machine pistols, shotguns, and rifles.</p>
<h4><a name="fldcraft">Field craft</a></h4>

<p>Your knowledge and experience of all aspects of outdoor survival.</p>
<h4><a name="stealth">Stealth</a></h4>

<p>Your physical fitness, the speed of your reflexes, and your dexterity.</p>
<h4><a name="perceptn">Perception</a></h4>

<p>Your intelligence, your ability to evaluate information, your education, and your mental alertness.</p>
<p>Your ability in each of these five individual skills is measured in skill points. You begin with 3 points per skill. Before starting the adventure, you may allocate an additional 4 skill points to your list of five Survival Skills. These 4 extra points can be used to improve one or more of your five skills. During your adventure, all five skills will be severely tested; therefore the higher the individual skill level, the better your chances of survival. You may allocate your 4 additional points entirely how you like.</p>
<p>When you have decided where to allocate your 4 additional skill points, make a note of the totals in the Survival Skills section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (In your first adventure, your total number of skill points should be 19: five skills x 3 points each = 15, plus 4 additional skill points = 19 points.)</p>
<p>If you complete successfully the mission set in Book 1 of the <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> series, you may add an additional 4 points to your Survival Skills in Book 2. These additional points, together with any equipment and provisions that you possess at the end of Book 1, may then be used in the next <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> adventure, which is called <a href="../../fw/02smr/title.htm#title"><cite>Slaughter Mountain Run</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Apart from your clothing, a number of useful items form your basic equipment. These comprise a Backpack and a belt on which hang your Ammo Pouch, Medi-kit, Water Canteen, and Hunting Knife. In addition to these items, you possess a <a href="#map">Map of Central Texas</a>, which you carry tucked inside your leather jacket.</p>
<h4><a name="backpack">Backpack</a></h4>

<p>Up to ten separate items may be stored and carried in your Backpack at any time. However, if more than three items are carried, your Stealth level will be reduced by 1 point. If more than six items are carried, your Stealth level will be reduced by 2 points; and if you carry a full Backpack (containing ten items), your Stealth level will be reduced by 3 points.</p>
<p>In order to equip yourself for the task ahead, you may choose up to four items from the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solar Torch</strong></li>
<li><strong>HE (High Explosive) Grenade</strong></li>
<li><strong>Binoculars</strong></li>
<li><strong>Compass</strong></li>
<li><strong>CB Radio</strong></li>
<li><strong>Signal Flare</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three Meals</strong> (each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack)</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Saw</strong></li>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small6.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>List the items you have chosen on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have picked four items, adjust your current Stealth level accordingly.</p>
<p>Opportunities may arise during your adventure for you to pick up useful items. These items will appear in the text in bold print and, unless you are instructed otherwise, they can be stored and carried in your Backpack.</p>
<p>You will need to eat regularly. If you do not possess any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<h4><a name="ammpouch">Ammo Pouch</a></h4>

<p>Your Ammo Pouch is where you store any spare ammunition for firearms. It can hold a maximum of the following:</p>
<p>
         40 rounds of 9mm calibre Pistol/Machine Pistol ammunition<br />
         or<br />
         20 rounds of 7.62mm calibre Rifle ammunition<br />
         or<br />
         10 rounds of 12-gauge calibre Shotgun ammunition<br />
        </p>
<p>When carrying mixed calibres of ammunition, use this equation to check how much space you have left in your Ammo Pouch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 x 9mm rounds = 2 x 7.62 rounds = 1 x 12 gauge round</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Additional ammunition can be carried in your Backpack. Ammunition occupies one space for each quantity that is equal to (or less than) the maximum that can be carried in one Ammo Pouch.</p>
<h4><a name="medikit">Medi-kit</a></h4>

<p>A well-stocked Medi-kit can make all the difference to your chances of survival should you suffer injury in the field or as a result of combat. It contains useful first aid supplies, such as dressings, antiseptics, antibiotics, water purification tablets, sulfonamides, pain killers, potassium iodide tablets (to delay absorption of radioactivity), and sutures.</p>
<p>For convenience, these medical supplies are grouped into units. To find how many units you have in your Medi-kit, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> (0 equals 10) and add 2. Your total score equals the number of units with which you begin your adventure. To keep a record of them, circle the appropriate number of unit symbols in the Medi-kit section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. The maximum number of units you can carry in your Medi-kit is twelve.</p>
<p>You may use your Medi-kit units to restore lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points; each unit used in this way restores 3 points. Units cannot be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in lieu of a Meal or Water when instructed to eat or drink.</p>
<h4><a name="canteen">Water Canteen</a></h4>

<p>Water is essential to life, and your life will depend on having a sufficient, uncontaminated supply. You will need to drink regularly during your adventure. One drink is equivalent to half a pint and your canteen holds exactly two pints of water: enough for one day’s needs. When instructed to drink, be sure to tick off one box in the Water section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have any Water when instructed to drink, you must lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<h3><a name="weapons">Weapons</a></h3>

<h4><a name="close">Close Combat Weapons</a></h4>

<p>These weapons aid you in hand-to-hand fighting. You begin your adventure armed with a Hunting Knife which, when used in close combat, adds 2 points to your <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small>. Note this Hunting Knife in the Close Combat Weapons section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you find a close combat weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. Close combat weapons will appear in the text with a close combat skill number, for example, Machete (3). This number indicates how many points this weapon will add to your <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> when used in a hand-to-hand fight.</p>
<p>The maximum number of close combat weapons you may carry is <em>two</em>, though you may only wield one at any time.</p>
<h4><a name="missile">Missile Weapons</a></h4>

<p>There are four types of missile weapon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pistol</li>
<li>Machine Pistol</li>
<li>Shotgun</li>
<li>Rifle</li>
</ul>
<p>You begin your adventure armed with only one of these weapons. Make your choice and then record the weapon you have chosen, together with its calibre and rate of fire details, in the Missile Weapons section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>In order to be able to use a missile weapon, you must have sufficient ammunition of the correct calibre. The following list shows the calibre of each weapon, the amount that is used every time the weapon is fired, and the number of rounds that you possess at the start of your adventure:</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><th /><th>Calibre</th><th>Rate of Fire</th><th>Initial No. of Rounds</th></tr><tr><td>Pistol</td><td>9mm</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td>Machine Pistol</td><td>9mm</td><td align="center">6<sup><a href="#weapons-1-foot" name="weapons-1">1</a></sup></td><td align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td>Shotgun</td><td>12-gauge</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td>Rifle</td><td>7.62mm</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">4</td></tr></table>
<p>The initial number of rounds should be noted in the Ammo Pouch section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. Missile weapons cannot be used if you run out of ammunition or possess only rounds of the wrong calibre. However, the opportunity may arise for you to replenish your supply of ammunition and/or discover a weapon of the correct calibre.</p>
<p>You may carry a maximum of three missile weapons. However, for every missile weapon that you carry (excluding your initial choice), you must reduce your Stealth level by 1 point.</p>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Close Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions when you will have to fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy’s <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> level will both be given in the text. Your aim in close combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero or below while losing as few of your own <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible.</p>
<p>At the start of a close combat, enter both your own and your enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Close Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for close combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through the use of close combat weapons to your current <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />

         Example<br />
         Cal Phoenix (<small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> 17) is attacked by a Renegade Clansman (<small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> 18). He is not given the opportunity to evade close combat, but must stand and fight his adversary. Cal Phoenix is armed with a Hunting Knife, so he adds 2 points to his <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> of 19.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Renegade Clansman’s <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +1 (19 − 18 = +1). He notes this +1 on his <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>After working out your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Close Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the number that you have picked (the random numbers appear down the side of the chart). You now have the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Cal Phoenix and his enemy in this round of close combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; CP represents points lost by Cal Phoenix.)<br /><br />

         Example<br />
         The Combat Ratio between Cal Phoenix and the Renegade Clansman has been established as +1. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 4, then the result of the first round of close combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Cal Phoenix loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>Renegade Clansman loses 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the close combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, start the next round of close combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from stage 3.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This procedure continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Cal Phoenix are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Cal Phoenix is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Cal Phoenix proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">Summary of the Close Combat Rules</a> appears on the page after the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade close combat. If you have already engaged in a round of close combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored; only Cal Phoenix may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but that is the risk of running away! You may evade combat only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>After a week of careful preparation, the colony is ready to begin the long trek to Big Spring. Three vehicles have been picked to make up the convoy: the school bus, your customized roadster, and a gasolene tanker that was salvaged from an old drilling site at nearby Greenville. Cutter and your uncle have rigged up a square canvas canopy to hide the tanker’s tell-tale cylindrical body, which now holds over 5,000 gallons of petroleum, siphoned from the underground storage tanks at the Ewell ranch. In this fuel-starved world, gasolene is the most valuable of all commodities. If the city gangs were to discover that DC1 were transporting such a precious load they would stop at nothing to capture it.</p>
<p>Most of the colony will be travelling aboard the bus, which will be driven by your uncle. Cutter will drive the tanker and you, acting as scout, will drive your roadster at the head of the convoy. With the bus full of passengers, luggage is limited to essential supplies only; everything else will be destroyed before leaving McKinney. At dawn, on the day before the convoy is to set off, a thorough check is made of the vehicles and provisions. There is enough food and water to reach your destination but, apart from your personal weapons, the colony has very few firearms with which to defend itself.</p>
<p>Long Jake Bannerman, a former roustabout from Gainsville, has volunteered to drive north and search for weapons and ammunition. His brother once owned a hardware store in Sherman and kept his stock of sporting guns locked in the basement. Although they may have to be dug out there is a good chance that they have survived intact. Everyone agrees that it is worth a try, and so Jake, equipped with a CB radio, a shovel, and a rusty revolver, sets out for Sherman in his beat-up old truck.</p>
<p>Two hours later he radios a message from Sherman. He has found rifles and ammunition, but his truck has broken down and he is now stranded in the town. He has also found a survivor—a teenage girl—and he requests that you come to pick them up as soon as possible. Uncle Jonas agrees. He tells him to sit tight and wait for you to arrive.</p>
<p>‘Trust Jake to go an’ maroon hi’self with a gal!’ grumbles Uncle Jonas, wryly. ‘Cal, you better git your body up to Sherman and haul ’em back here. An’ no messin’ with street punks on the way, y’hear!’</p>
<p>‘We’ll be back in time for breakfast!’ you reply, cheerily, as you slide behind the wheel of your roadster and fire up its throaty V-8 engine. Then, with a farewell wave, you power the car out of McKinney and speed northwards to Sherman along what remains of Highway 75.</p>

<p>You are about to search the bodies for items that may help you survive when you hear the mob ascending the stairs. Immediately you abandon the idea and concentrate on making an escape. At the end of the corridor is an open window. Below is an alleyway that passes to the rear of the bar. Without a moment’s hesitation, you climb out onto the ledge and leap to the ground, landing with a jolt that leaves you breathless. Gasping for air, you stagger along the alley and out into a deserted street. The jump has robbed you of stamina but at least you didn’t break any bones.</p>
<p>Desperately you look for somewhere to hide while you recover. An old boarding house opposite seems to be the answer to your prayers, and you cross the street and enter before the mob reappears.</p>

<p>You recall that these letters are the chemical symbol for sodium chloride—common salt.

<p>You pull and release the bolt of your G-12 then level the barrel at the leading dog as it gets ready to make its leap. Hurriedly you squeeze off a burst of fire that rips through its chest and sends its lifeless body spinning backwards among the rest of the pack. The death of their brother—and the noise and fury of your weapon—brings the pack to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>Moonlight pours in through a large hole in the roof, illuminating the interior of the store. Judging by the nature of the debris littering the floor, this place was once a liquor store.

<p>Your bullet hits home, striking the machine gunner squarely in the chest and spinning him away from the window with the force of its impact. You breathe a little easier. Then a long burst of fire echoes from inside the building, causing you to duck involuntarily. But this time you are in no immediate danger. Your single shot proved fatal and, in the throes of death, your enemy has emptied a full magazine into the walls and shattered ceiling of the drugstore.</p>

<p>Your caution was well placed. As you focus on the town you count over twenty motorcycles parked at random along the highway. Their riders are looting the stores and houses nearby, and much of what they have found lies heaped beside their machines. Suddenly a pinpoint of light climbs into the sky and explodes with a brilliant white flash that illuminates the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>‘What do you make of that?’ you say, as Cutter and Kate join you to find out what is wrong.</p>

<p>The climb is steep and tortuous but you manage to reach the top of the gully in one piece. Carefully, you pick your way around the edge until you happen upon a narrow path that ascends towards the flickering light on the mountainside above. As you draw closer, you see that the light is being cast by a small fire burning at the entrance to a cave. You approach with caution.

<p>A gnawing pain, brought on by the exertion of opening your backpack, stiffens your right hand. You grit your teeth and persist until your aching fingers locate the tip of your survival flare. With care you remove it from the pack and position it between the ropes that bind your body in such a way as to avoid burning yourself when you set it off.</p>
<p>Less than a dozen clanswomen and children are on the street when you decide to fire the flare. There is a flash of red light at your side as it erupts into life; then you are engulfed by a huge cloud of choking crimson smoke. The flare alerts the clanswomen who immediately raise the alarm while you struggle against your smouldering bonds.</p>

<p>It takes just four seconds for the clansman to pump thirty bullets into the side of your roadster. Several of the special armour-piercing loads pass straight through the thin metal sheeting that encases the driving compartment, and wound you in a line from your shoulder to your thigh. The force of their impact knocks you across the passenger seat and, as you fall, you pull the steering wheel and send the car veering wildly out of control. It careers off the road and rolls over and over until finally it explodes with a tremendous roar.</p>

<p>Curious as to what lies within, you enter the strongroom and inspect its dusty shelves. This concrete vault contains the documentation of experiments and small quantities of what were once considered precious metals—gold, platinum, silver, and titanium.

Tiny fragments of the high-velocity bullet pepper your headrest but you survive the attack unscathed. Quickly you recover control of your car and signal to the others to accelerate.

<p>Obstructions are few on this stretch of Interstate 35.

<p>It is nearly dusk when the clansmen and their chief reappear. Slowly the shiny Thunderbird drives towards you, positioned at the head of a torchlit procession of men and women dressed in strange, ceremonial robes. Chief Drawoher brings the line to a halt before the totem and calls for silence. Then he extols the virtues of Heng, the Thunder Spirit, and asks that he grant their request for rain. The clansmen form a wide circle around you and, as their leader steps forwards, they chant loudly and hypnotically.</p>
<p>With a glint of madness in his eyes, the chief unsheathes the sacrificial dagger, a blade carved from the bone of a buffalo, and holds it above his head. ‘You die so that the land may live!’ he screams, his voice barely audible above the drone of his followers. In desperation, you remove your free hand from behind your back and attempt to grab his wrist as he brings the dagger down towards your heart.</p>

<p>Painfully you drag yourself to your feet. You wait until the footfalls of the patrol have passed out of earshot and then venture out into the park once more. You manage to avoid another patrol before escaping from the amusement park and meeting up with Cutter at the truck depot. You are both relieved to discover that the place is empty and unguarded, and quickly you make your way to the stores building. You find the records office, but without electricity you cannot access the computer files to pinpoint the exact location of the spare you need. With horror you realize that in order to find a new steering linkage you will have to search every one of the 1,600 storage bays that occupy the building.</p>
<p>‘We’ll be here forever if we have to search the shelves,’ you whisper.</p>
<p>‘I guess you’re right,’ replies Cutter, ‘but I think I know a quicker way of finding what we need. Follow me.’</p>
<p>Intrigued by Cutter’s reply, you follow him out of the stores building, across a parking lot, and into another section of the depot that is marked:</p>
<div class="signpost">Zone 3: Municipal Vehicle Servicing</div>
<p>After searching four of the dozen service bays, finally he discovers what he is looking for: a school bus. ‘Cal, you keep y’eyes open while I strip the linkage out o’ this baby. Give me an hour an’ we’ll be on our way.’</p>
<p>Nervously you stand guard at the door to the service bay while Cutter works. All is quiet until, forty minutes later, you see something moving among the vehicles on the far side of the parking lot: it is a drunken clansman. Slowly he staggers nearer, taking alternate gulps from bottles clutched in either hand. He is about to pass by when Cutter drops a spanner. The ringing noise pierces his drunken stupor and prompts him to investigate.</p>
<p>‘Trouble on its way!’ you whisper to Cutter, but your warning is too late. The clansman comes lumbering through the open door, brandishing his bottles like clubs. He sees you and screams an oath as he gets ready to launch his attack.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ll be…!’ mutters Hammer, scarcely able to believe his eyes. High in the azure sky you see a tin flying machine with fragile, bat-shaped wings. Spellbound, the colony watches as the plane circles above the town and comes in to land on the stretch of freeway that approaches the bridge. Slowly the pilot extricates himself from the tiny, motorized hang glider, and gives a friendly wave as he strides towards the group.</p>

<p>Rickenbacker warns the colony that a large group of clansmen is riding towards the town from the east. They are less than five miles distant and closing fast. He also tells you about another gang of bikers, a clan called the ‘Mavericks’, who have been the bane of the Big Spring colony for the last six months. They control the city of Lubbock, 100 miles to the north, and their raiding parties are in the area foraging for food. ‘I know the next thirty miles ain’t gonna be easy for you folks, but there’s a big welcome waitin’ for y’all at Big Spring,’ he says, as he gets ready to take to the air once more. ‘Don’t delay now. We’re countin’ on you to make it through.’</p>

The Lions are closer than anyone dared imagine and everyone is eager to get across the river before they show up.

<p>From the window of a room on the second floor you watch as the mob floods out of the alley and into the street below. They divide into two groups and begin searching the adjoining streets, seemingly convinced that you are still out in the open. Silently you crouch by the window, awaiting the chance to slip out of Cross Plains unseen. While you are lying low, you must take a drink or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. It is dusk before you are able to escape from the town. With relief you discover that your roadster is still parked at the gas station, and quickly you climb in and accelerate away.</p>
<p>When you reach Rising Star you find that the convoy is awaiting your return with trepidation. Because you are so long overdue, they feared that you had fallen foul of Mad Dog Michigan and his bikers. You tell them what happened to you in Cross Plains and everyone agrees that, with darkness almost upon you, it is too dangerous to continue.</p>
<p>The night at Rising Star passes uneventfully and at first light the convoy sets off cross-country towards Abilene. The arid, stony bed of Pecan Bayou provides excellent cover from the surrounding high ground and leads the convoy northwest, back towards Interstate 20. Shortly after midday you reach the freeway, from which you can see the outskirts of Abilene less than five miles distant.</p>

The Mavericks who survived your brief but devastating visit to Coahoma are now in pursuit, and they are closing the gap swiftly. Shots are fired from the back of the bus, bringing down two of the leading bikes, but they do not prevent the others from moving alongside. Anxiously you watch in your rear-view mirror as the pillion riders risk their lives to jump aboard. The few who survive the leap without falling under the wheels gain entry by kicking their way through the windows.</p>

<p>Slowly the two figures shamble to the edge of the highway and stare at you with vacant eyes. Your spirited dispatch of their dogs has not worried them in the slightest; neither do they appear unduly concerned for their own safety. You stand your ground, challenging them to attack if they dare. They laugh. It is a pitiful, thin sound, which makes your flesh crawl. You return their empty stares, noting with disgust the ulcer-like sores that cover their pale, greyish skins, their almost complete lack of hair, and their teeth, black with decay. Your disgust turns to pity, however, when suddenly you realize why they show no fear: they are both afflicted with terminal radiation sickness. Death is already their companion.</p>
<p>‘Where are you from?’ you call, anxious to discover if there is a hot spot—a zone of radioactivity—nearby.</p>

<p>A vote decides the course of action in your favour, and the convoy prepares for the next stage of its journey to Santo. You lead the way along Interstate 20 and, as you pass by the outskirts of a town called Brock, the sun dips reluctantly below the horizon.

<p>The lake occupies the centre of a saucer-like depression and, as you bring your roadster to a halt at the edge of this rocky rim and stare down at the shimmering water below, you are heartened to see that clumps of vegetation are growing close by: a sure sign that the water is not contaminated.</p>
<p>The sides of the depression are steep and covered with loose shale. Rather than risk a fall, you suggest to Kate that perhaps you should go down to the lake alone. When you reach it, she could throw the containers to you, and then help you with them when you climb back out. The idea does not impress her. ‘It’s been so long, I can’t remember the last time I took a dip in some real water. I’m sick a’ washin’ in sand. If you think I’m gonna hang around up here while you splash about down there, you’ve got another think comin’, buster!’</p>

<p>Much of Abilene lies in the shadow of a bank of cloud, which has darkened the land since mid-morning. At first the unexpected arrival of this cloud cover cheers the colony, for it brings with it a welcome respite from the burning heat and promises a possible end to the drought. Unfortunately, these initial hopes are soon shattered.</p>
<p>As you approach the city a fierce wind arises. It sweeps down from the north and lashes the convoy, not with rain, but with blinding clouds of grit and sand. Within the space of half an hour the colony is engulfed in a ferocious duststorm that threatens to bury you all without trace. At the first opportunity you signal to the others to pull off the elevated freeway and seek shelter from the storm. The danger of grit finding its way into the engines of the convoy vehicles, causing them irreparable damage, is uppermost in your mind, and anxiously you search for shelter.</p>

You signal to Cutter to follow you into the school yard, but the storm is reaching its peak and you are forced to halt before you can see the school itself. Quickly the colony disembarks and blindly you lead them in single file, heads bowed against the stinging wind, until you reach the school building. Fortunately, it still has a roof and four walls, and offers adequate protection from the storm. Once inside, Aunt Betty-Ann decides to take a roll call to make sure everyone is present. She is about to begin when Rosita Rodriguez cries out in anguish, ‘Maria! Where is my Maria? She is not here!’</p>

<p>You hobble the last few yards to cover, your wound making you grit your teeth. Another burst of fire cuts through the bushes within inches of your skull. Fear blocks out the pain, making you concentrate on finding a way out of the ambush.</p>
<p>Carefully, you raise your head and peer through the foliage. One of the clansmen is beginning to move around the edge of the hollow, while his partner kneels and waits to give covering fire. Your fear turns to indignation when you realize that he is going after your car.</p>

<p>Cutter helps you search the bodies and the diner. You discover the following items:</p>

<p>Once the convoy is clear of the bridge, Cutter pulls over to the side of the highway and you stop in line behind him and the tanker. Uncle Jonas jumps down from his cab and together you run forward to check the damage to the bus. The front and sides are riddled with bullet holes, many of which have penetrated the engine and passenger compartments, yet, miraculously, no one has been killed or seriously injured. Aunt Betty-Ann appears at a window and reports that four members of the colony have been hit. She says not to worry—they have minor wounds and she is sure they will pull through.</p>
<p>The radiator is leaking coolant but Cutter is confident that he can have it fixed within an hour. ‘It’s a real shame we’ve got so few guns aboard,’ grumbles Cutter, as he sets to work sealing the perforated radiator mesh. ‘It ain’t no fun being the target for them punks when you don’t get a chance to shoot back.’</p>
<p>A hundred yards along the highway you see a sign that points to a road leading off to the east. It says:</p>

<p>As you near the centre of the corral, you throw yourself forward and reach out for the knife.

<p>With a cotton bandana tied around your nose and mouth, and the collar of your leather jacket pulled close to your face, you set off into the storm.

<p>You pull over in order to check the battle damage and allow the rest of the convoy to catch up with you. Fortunately the vital rear sections of your roadster—the fuel tank, axle, and tyres—are still intact. Most of the damage has been absorbed by the trunk and the fender, but the incident makes you sorely aware of the need for better protection, and you make a mental note to ask Cutter to help you reinforce the bodywork at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the convoy arrives. Having passed the burning remains of your adversaries the others are relieved to find you still in one piece. You inform them that the bikers were Detroit Lions, probably scouts, and that you suspect that the clan is no more than thirty miles away. ‘Well, at least those two you ran into won’t be reporting our position to Mad Dog, or anyone else for that matter,’ says Cutter, wryly.</p>
<p>‘Even so,’ says Uncle Jonas, ‘we daren’t afford t’ stop too long in any one place. We gotta keep ahead o’ that pack all the way to Big Spring.’</p>
<p>The next town on the freeway is Sweetwater. Most of the buildings are still standing, although few have roofs as a result of yesterday’s storm. Except for a few hungry coyote that have come down from the hills looking for jack rabbits, the place is deserted.</p>
<p>Cutter signals for you to stop. The engine of the bus is overheating and, despite the risk of a clan attack, it must be allowed to cool down. The others take the opportunity to search the town for food, and you busy yourself by refuelling your roadster. ‘What do you make of that, Cal?’ says Uncle Jonas, as you finish rewinding the tanker’s fuel pipe. He is standing on the cab of the tanker, pointing at a shimmering ribbon of light to the south of the town. You climb up beside him and immediately you see that it is the sun reflecting off the surface of a small lake. ‘Water!’ you both exclaim, excitedly.</p>
<p>The chance of replenishing the colony’s depleted water supply is too good an opportunity to miss. Uncle Jonas helps you load some empty plastic containers onto your roadster, and Kate volunteers to come with you to help fill and carry them. As soon as she is aboard, you start the engine and drive off towards the distant lake.</p>

<p>A pack of five dogs suddenly appears at the side of the road, their stealthy approach concealed by the mound of loose earth excavated from the highway trench. At first glance they look like Alsatians, but you soon see that these dogs are much larger and fiercer. They fix you hungrily with their feral eyes, their mouths slavering and foaming as they stalk forward. Then two figures come into view behind them, gaunt and pale despite the desert sun. With a rasping scream, they command the dogs to attack and immediately the pack obeys.</p>

Then the two men appear. They shamble to the edge of the trench and stare at you with vacant eyes. The skilful way in which you distracted their dogs does not seem to have antagonized them in the slightest, nor do they appear unduly concerned for their own safety. You stand your ground, challenging them to attack if they dare. They laugh. It is a pitiful, thin sound that makes your flesh crawl. You return their empty stares, noting with disgust the ulcer-like sores that cover their pale, greyish skins; their almost complete lack of hair; and their teeth, black with decay. Your disgust turns to pity, however, when suddenly you realize why they show no fear: they are both afflicted with terminal radiation sickness. Death is already their companion.</p>

<p>The dying screams of their chief dispel the trance into which the clansmen have fallen, but before they can act, you jump into the Thunderbird and twist the ignition key. The moment the antique engine growls into life, you stamp on the gas pedal and accelerate away from the crowd. In a cloud of dust and blue smoke you leave Cross Plains and return to the gas station where you parked your roadster. Before ditching the Thunderbird you search it thoroughly and discover that the trunk contains a Pistol and three rounds of 9mm ammunition. Then, with night drawing in, you climb into your own car and drive away at top speed.</p>
<p>When you reach Rising Star you find that the convoy is awaiting your return with trepidation. Because you are so long overdue, they feared that you had fallen foul of Mad Dog Michigan and his bikers. You tell them what happened to you in Cross Plains and everyone agrees that, with darkness almost upon you, it is too dangerous to continue.</p>

Between these heaps of twisted scrap are avenues covered with slabs of broken earth that jut upwards at all angles, their sharp edges baked hard by months in the furnace-like heat.

You look up to see the rider clutching his face with both hands. He swoons, falls backwards, and then tumbles from the saddle. Before the sidecar rider can jump free, the speeding machine careers off the road into the wall of an office building, and explodes in a searing ball of flame.</p>

<p>You spring to your feet and run at the exit. However, the stripy-faced youth, whom you encountered earlier wielding a lasso, suddenly appears in the doorway, blocking your escape. As he reaches for a revolver, which is tucked into his waistband, you lower your shotgun and fire. Only one barrel discharges—the other misfires—but the blast is great enough to lift your adversary off his feet and send him cartwheeling out of the door.</p>
<p>You leap over his body and run along an alley that leads into a side street. You hear the mob yell out when they find the body, and you know that they will press their pursuit, so frantically you search for somewhere safe to hide. An old boarding house on the corner of the street looks like the answer to your prayers. You enter before the mob reaches the end of the alley.</p>

<p>‘Let’s go!’ says Cutter, and simultaneously you leap into action. Your sudden appearance draws a volley of shots from a shallow gully situated twenty yards ahead, and a wave of fear knots your stomach as the bullets whistle past your head. Then Kate and the others open fire and force the bikers to duck behind their parapet of earth.</p>
<p>On the far side, Cutter races across the rocky ground as fast as his skinny legs will carry him. A biker pops out of the gully like a jack-in-the-box and fires his pistol at your friend’s lanky form, missing him by inches. Cutter fires back, a snap shot from the hip that hits the biker full in the chest, sending him spinning backwards into the trench. Three more bikers appear, panicked by the death of their confederate. One falls victim to covering fire; the second is felled by Cutter’s second barrel; but the third escapes the crossfire and comes running out of the gully straight at you. He yelps with horror as he sees you, skids to a halt, and levels his pistol at your face.</p>

<p>You awake ten hours later in a schoolroom bathed in bright sunlight. The storm has passed during the night and the sun has returned, bringing with it the oppressive heat. ‘Ninety-two degrees already,’ says Cutter, tapping at an old mercuric thermometer that hangs on the wall. ‘And it’s not yet eight o’clock. Today’s a day for fryin’ eggs on the sidewalk…if we had any eggs, that is.’</p>
<p>Soon the colony is busy making preparations to leave. After clearing away the dust you check your roadster thoroughly, making sure that the fuel is clean and that the engine runs as smoothly as ever. Meanwhile, Cutter oversees a group who are working on the bus and Uncle Jonas heads another team who are servicing the tanker. The others, led by Kate, search the school for anything that could be useful on the road ahead. By mid-morning the convoy is back on the road, following Interstate 20 away from the dust-blown ruins of Abilene on the next stage of the journey west.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the tanker and the bus come thundering out of Coahoma. Apart from a few extra bullet holes, they both appear to have survived the run intact. You restart your engine and accelerate away, confident that the colony will reach Big Spring before sunset, but when you glance in your rear-view mirror you spot something that sets your pulse racing.</p>

<p>The twin beams of your headlights cast a white corridor of light along Interstate 20 as you overtake and pull in to take your place at the head of the convoy. With the memory of the bikers’ raid still fresh in your mind, you cast frequent glances in your rear-view mirror to make sure that the clansmen are not on your tail.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small12.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The road climbs steadily for several miles as it approaches the mountains of Erath County. A signpost reflects the glare of your lights, announcing your entry to the town of Thurber, which once had a population of 5,006. You contemplate that figure, wondering how many, if any, inhabitants are still alive, when you are distracted by a light flashing in your mirror. It is the bus: Uncle Jonas is signalling for you to stop.</p>
<p>You reach the bus soon after Cutter and hear him asking what is wrong. Uncle Jonas says nothing. He simply tugs at the steering wheel and watches in dismay as it spins freely on the hub. ‘Looks like we’ve got ourselves a big problem,’ says Cutter, peering under the front wheel arch. ‘The steering linkage has sheared clean in two. I’d guess that rough ride out o’ Santo did for it good and proper.’</p>
<p>‘Can you fix it?’ asks Uncle Jonas.</p>
<p>‘Not without welding gear, or a replacement part,’ he replies, dejectedly. ‘I guess we’d better stop here for the night. Looks like we won’t get much further in this ol’ bus, anyhow.’</p>
<p>An uneasy silence descends on the colony once news of the breakdown spreads. Cutter continues to inspect the bus but you decide to return to your roadster and snatch a few hours sleep. You are staring at the surrounding mountains, lost in thought, when you see a pinpoint of light flickering in the darkness. With your pulse racing, you grab your gun and set off to take a closer look.</p>

<p>As the man hurries towards your car, he sees you crouching behind the engine and panics, shooting wildly. He empties his pistol and then, in frustrated anger, he leaps across the hood of your roadster and jumps on you, wielding the butt of his gun like a cosh.</p>
<p class="combat">Six-pac: <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> 17   <small>ENDURANCE</small> 27</p>

<p>On your arrival at Colorado City you discover that the colony has been busy during your absence. Using materials salvaged from the ruins of nearby factories, they have managed to put down a platform that spans the gap in the middle of the bridge. Now Cutter is supervising the strengthening of this platform to ensure that it will withstand the weight of the loaded tanker, the heaviest of the convoy vehicles.</p>
<p>You tell everyone that you were unable to find an alternative way across the river, expecting the news to be met with disappointment. But most of the colony greets your scouting report with a nod of approval, a reaction that baffles you until Kate offers an explanation. ‘That explosive we found at Lake Sweetwater is now under the bridge,’ she says, pointing towards the newly-laid platform. ‘Once we’re all on the other side, I’ll trigger the timer and two minutes later…boom! No bridge! It might not stop the Lions chasing us but it should keep ’em off our backs until we reach Big Spring.’</p>
<p>You are about to take a closer look when Pop Ewell calls everyone to the bus. He has made radio contact with Big Spring. ‘Here, Cal,’ he says, handing you the headphones, ‘your ears are younger than mine. See if you can figure out what they’re saying.’</p>
<p>You slip on the headphones and listen to a voice that is almost completely obscured by the hiss and crackle of static. You close your eyes and concentrate as hard as you can in an effort to understand what is being said. ‘The guy says he’s going to pay us a visit,’ you say, hesitantly, suspecting that you have not heard the message correctly. Then the static fades and clearly you hear the words: ‘Be with you soon. Watch the skies!’</p>

<p>The whole of your right arm aches painfully from the exertion of opening your pack, but you ignore the pain and persist until your fingers locate the loops of your flexible wire saw. With care you remove it, slip it around the ropes that bind you, and slowly work it back and forth until they part. Less than a dozen clanswomen and children are on the street, but you bide your time, waiting for the right moment to make your move.</p>
<p>Carefully you consider the two escape routes that appear open to you. You can either run east along the main street and back towards your car, retracing the route by which you entered Cross Plains; or you can run in the opposite direction and attempt to hide in the maze of alleys that once serviced the town stores.</p>

<p>‘Yahoo! There she is!’ screams Cutter, pointing excitedly at a fortified settlement that has just appeared in the distance. ‘Big Spring! We’ve made it!’</p>
<p>All the hardships that have been suffered <i xml:lang="fr">en route</i> are instantly forgotten when the members of the colony look upon their destination. Suddenly the bus is filled with laughing, crying, cheering people as everyone reaffirms their hope that this journey is the first step towards the civilization they once knew.</p>
<p>A green flare climbs into the darkening sky and bursts over the town, signalling that the Big Spring colony has seen you approaching. Pop Ewell makes radio contact, and passes on their welcome. ‘They say the freeway gate is open. All we got t’ do is drive straight in.’</p>
<p>The Mavericks seemed to give up the chase as soon as they saw the flare, and now the freeway looks deserted. You join Cutter at the front of the bus and scan the landscape for some sign of your roadster, but the only other vehicle you can see is the tanker, trundling along a few hundred yards ahead.</p>
<p>A few minutes later you see your car in the distance, parked at the side of the freeway. As you draw nearer you get ready to wave to Kate. Your heart almost stops when, with horror, you see that two motorcycles are parked alongside, and Kate is embroiled in a desperate hand-to-hand struggle with their riders. ‘Stop the bus, Cutter!’ you shout. ‘It’s Kate; she’s in trouble.’</p>
<p>Cutter slows the bus and you leap out onto the freeway and run towards Kate. ‘Help me, Cal!’ she screams, as the Mavericks try to bundle her, kicking and punching, into a sidecar attached to one of their machines. A blow to the back of her head with the stock of a machine pistol brings an end to her resistance. Then, as you approach, the biker turns and fires a long burst from the hip.</p>

<p>‘Strawn is held by a gang o’ renegades,’ says Mountain Goat, looking west along the freeway in the direction of the town. ‘There’s ’bout forty of them.

<p>You force yourself to breathe deeply, giving your blood the oxygen it craves. As your pulse steadies and your vision clears, you see a second fire escape that services the far side of the building. Slowly you make your way towards it, taking care to avoid the many holes that puncture the roof; then you race down the steps and escape along a deserted passage that leads to a derelict timber yard.

<p>The road stretches before you, empty and silent, shimmering beneath the early morning sun. With the temperature already in the mid-nineties, you are grateful for the cool breeze that whips through your hair as you speed across the barren flats. The tracks made by Long Jake’s tyres are still fresh in the dust that blankets the highway, and you trail them all the way to the outskirts of Sherman, where you discover his pick-up abandoned near an old gas station.</p>
<p>A line of footprints disappears towards the centre of the town, and, as you follow them along the main street, you catch sight of Long Jake, a rifle in his hand, waving at you from the doorway of his brother’s store. Behind him stands a girl. She looks eighteen, maybe younger. Judging by the state of her clothing she must have been through a pretty rough time. You bring your roadster to a halt in front of the store and, nervously, Long Jake motions you to enter. ‘Quick, Cal!’ he hisses. ‘Get over here!’</p>
<p>You are barely out of the driving seat when a burst of machine gun fire rings out across the street. Bullets hit the ground near your feet and a number of holes appear, stitched in a jagged row across the trunk of your car.</p>

<p>A sudden sound to your left betrays the hiding place of a would-be ambusher. You spin on your heel, drawing your hunting knife and tensing yourself in expectation of an attack. Lurking in the doorway is a scrawny youth dressed in tattered buckskin. His clothes, and the coloured stripes that mark his face, remind you of books you read when you were young; books with pictures of Red Indian braves, who fought the cowboys of the old West. The youth screams a curse and casts a rope lasso around your shoulders, but before he can draw it tight, you sever it with one sweep of your razor-sharp blade. His scream echoes across the street and draws forth others of his kind, all of them dressed in similar Red Indian costumes. They advance towards you, brandishing knives and axes, and you turn and run in fear for your life.</p>
<p>As you run past the entrance to a small bar, another group appears on the sidewalk less than twenty yards ahead. Shots ring out, forcing you to dive for cover inside the bar. Fortunately the place is deserted, but the angry screams of the mob grow louder by the second. Quickly you scan the gloomy interior, searching for a way out or a place to hide.

<p>You move away, keeping an eye on your mirror to make sure that you do not outdistance the rest of the convoy. Then, as you approach the outskirts of the town, Kate raises her shotgun and gets ready to greet the Maverick clansmen who are brave, or foolish, enough to stand in your way. Gunfire erupts from the windows of the nearby buildings and bullets whistle past, fired from all directions. Kate opens up in reply, empty cartridge cases spewing from her gun as she picks off the renegade bikers with chilling accuracy. Then the first of the obstacles appears and you stamp your foot to the floor. The force of your car’s acceleration hits you like a kick in the back. The car screams through the town, scattering motorcycles and riders, its rear wheels trailing a blue haze of friction-burnt rubber.</p>
<p>The last few buildings are flashing past on either side when you see a solitary figure standing in the middle of the highway ahead. As you scream towards him, coolly he raises a rifle and takes aim at your windshield.</p>

<p>The familiar outline of McKinney appears on the horizon and you increase speed. You are keen to return as quickly as you can and warn the colony of the danger now approaching from the north. Your return is met with mixed feelings: all are upset to hear that Long Jake is dead, and many are disappointed that you could not save the cache of rifles and ammunition that he found. However, all, without exception, are thankful that you are still alive and, despite the threat of a revenge attack by Mad Dog Michigan, they welcome Kate to the colony with open arms.</p>

<p>Despite your anxiety you manage to get a few hours’ sleep before dawn. As the sky brightens, Uncle Jonas voices his fear that the vehicles are far too exposed out on the highway, where they can easily be spotted and will be sure to attract another raid like the one you endured last night at Santo. Cutter agrees, so before you set off for Strawn he fixes a line to the back of the tanker and tows the bus into a nearby gully.</p>
<p>There, Uncle Jonas and the others set to work dismantling the broken steering linkage, while Mountain Goat draws a map of Strawn, showing the location of the truck depot. He hands the sketch to Cutter, and you and he check your equipment and bid farewell to the others before setting off.</p>
<p>Two hours later you catch sight of the fortified town. It is perched on a ridge of high ground and enjoys an unobstructed view over the surrounding land. You note its perimeter wall, constructed of rubble and old cars, and the crudely built watchtowers that command its freeway approaches. It seems to you that it would be impossible for a large group, or even a single vehicle, to approach this town undetected, yet the rocky terrain that surrounds it enables you and Cutter to crawl to within a few hundred yards of the perimeter wall without being seen.</p>

<p>Cutter points to the side of the highway, where a length of crash barrier lies curled and twisted like a petrified metal snake. ‘We could rig that piece to the front of the bus,’ he says, indicating a v-shaped section shorter than the rest, ‘and use it like one o’ those ol’ fashioned batterin’ rams. It’ll protect the engine an’ wheels an’ pack one heck of a punch.’</p>
<p>Uncle Jonas looks sideways at Cutter, his eyes narrowed, his face drawn and serious. Then his expression softens and he starts to laugh. ‘Why, you sly old son of a gun. Trust you to figure out a way.’</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, the barrier is firmly roped and braced to the front of the bus. Cutter volunteers to take the wheel and lead the attack, with Uncle Jonas driving the tanker and you bringing up the rear in your roadster. If all goes to plan, the bus will smash through the barricade, leaving a gap wide enough for both the tanker and you to follow in its wake.</p>
<p>As soon as everyone is in position, Cutter gives the signal to move. Fortunately, the bridge is below you, at the bottom of a steep hill, enabling the bus to build up a good speed. Your heart quickens as the convoy gathers pace, and nervously you watch as your speedometer needle moves further around the dial.</p>
<p>The bus is fifty yards from the barricade when the defenders open fire, their automatic weapons filling the air with wave upon wave of lead. The vast bulk of the tanker shields you from this hail of death, but your heart goes out to those aboard the bus who must be bearing the brunt of this withering fire. Then you hear a tremendous crash as the bus slams into the barricade, and moments later you see the tanker shudder as it widens the gap that Cutter has made. It ploughs through with ease, but in doing so, it catches and spins the torn wreckage directly into your path.

<p>You enter the derelict factory and take up your position at a top floor window that overlooks both the freeway and the bridge. Below you can see Kate. She is crouching behind the auto wreck with a rifle in her hands. Nervously you count the passing seconds, your eyes fixed on the road.</p>

A lion’s head flag flutters from an aerial fixed to the rider’s saddle, and a heavy-calibre machine gun is mounted in front of his partner’s chair. As soon as they see the tanker they open fire, sending a stream of tracer bullets arcing towards the bridge. The fiery shells tear great holes in the asphalt and riddle Kate’s position, but bravely she holds her ground. You rest your weapon on the window ledge and watch the enemy vehicle through your gunsight as it speeds towards the bridge. You are about to fire when a single shot echoes along the street, and you see the rider throw his hands up to his face. Seconds later the speeding machine careers off the road, slams into the wall of an office building, and explodes in a searing ball of flame.</p>
<p>With grim satisfaction you stare at the burning wreckage, but your gaze is soon distracted by something moving across the roof of the building opposite. It is a clansman, dressed wholly in black leather and wearing a visored crash helmet. He stops at the corner, unslings a rifle, and takes careful aim at the bridge.

<p>You lead the convoy along the split and cratered surface of State Highway 571, across a wasteland of bleached hills and scorched scrub. In the distance you see mountains—the twin summits of Caddo Peaks and the craggy outline of Spring Mesa—standing sharp and clear against the backdrop of a cloudless sky. By mid-afternoon the temperature has climbed to 110° Fahrenheit, and the combined effects of the heat and poor road surface begin to take their toll. Two miles inside Comanche County, the tanker is forced to halt with an overheated engine. Luckily, the breakdown occurs within sight of the Sabana River, now little more than a torpid stream, and enough water is soon collected to enable the tanker to continue. (If you wish, you can refill your Water Canteen at the river at the cost of one Medi-kit unit.)</p>
<p>Gradually the road turns westwards and climbs towards high plains country. Then, as you approach the outskirts of a town called Rising Star, Cutter signals to you to stop. ‘We’ve got six people down with heat exhaustion, and four more on the brink,’ he says, his face awash with sweat. ‘We’ve got to get ’em out of this travelling oven and let ’em rest awhile in the shade.’</p>
<p>You suggest that the convoy waits in Rising Star while you go on ahead to make sure that Cross Plains is safe to enter.

<p>After two hours of painfully slow driving, the convoy reaches the far side of the lake, only to discover a hostile reception awaiting it. Just as you had suspected, the spy you saw earlier was a city gang member, one of a group of bikers out foraging for food. He has alerted the others in his group and now they lie in ambush, like a pack of hungry jackals, waiting for the convoy to come within range of their guns.</p>
<p>You have just cleared the top of the slope that marks the old shoreline of Lake Lewisville when the bikers make their presence felt. A volley of shots ricochets off the hood and side of your roadster, forcing you to swerve to a halt. Grabbing your gun, you leap out of the car and scream a warning to the others as you take cover at the edge of the lake. Cutter and Kate come running up the slope to join you but, just as they reach your side, a harsh voice yells out: ‘There are more than thirty of us here and we’re armed to the teeth. You don’t stand a chance. Throw down your weapons and surrender and we’ll spare your lives!’</p>

<p>You manage to avoid two more patrols before escaping from the mall and meeting up with Cutter at the truck depot. You are both relieved to discover the place empty and unguarded, and quickly you make your way to the stores building. You find the records office, but without electricity you cannot access the computer files to pinpoint the exact location of the spare you need. With mounting fear you realize that in order to find a new steering linkage you will have to search every one of the 1,600 storage bays that occupy the building.</p>
<p>‘We’ll be here forever if we have to search the shelves,’ you whisper.</p>
<p>‘I guess you’re right,’ replies Cutter, ‘but I think I know a quicker way of finding what we need. Follow me.’</p>
<p>Intrigued by Cutter’s reply, you follow him out of the stores building, across a parking lot and into another section of the depot that is marked:</p>
<div class="signpost">Zone 3: Municipal Vehicle Servicing</div>
<p>After searching four of the dozen service bays, finally he discovers what he is looking for: a school bus. ‘Cal, you keep y’eyes open while I strip the linkage out o’ this baby. Give me an hour an’ we’ll be on our way.’</p>
<p>Nervously you stand guard at the door to the service bay while Cutter works. All is quiet until, forty minutes later, you see something moving among the vehicles on the far side of the parking lot: it is a drunken clansman. Slowly he staggers nearer, taking alternating gulps from the bottles clutched in either hand. He is about to pass on his way when Cutter drops a spanner. The ringing noise pierces his drunken stupor and prompts him to investigate.</p>
<p>‘Trouble on its way!’ you whisper to Cutter, but your warning is too late. A moment later, the clansman comes lurching through the open door, brandishing his bottles like clubs. He sees you and screams an oath as he gets ready to launch his attack.</p>

As the excitement begins to wane, Cutter approaches and asks you to brave the storm once more, this time to retrieve food and other vital supplies from the bus. Willingly you agree.</p>
<p>‘This is one heck of a blue norther,’ he says, as you climb aboard the bus. ‘Reckon it could hold us here for a day or two before it blows itself out.’ ‘I sure hope you’re wrong,’ you reply, as you prise open the floor hatch that gives access to the luggage hold from inside the bus. ‘Take a look at this.’ A fetid smell rises from the compartment: the smell of rotten food. ‘Dadburn it! That’s all we need right now!’ exclaims Cutter, as he examines the swollen food parcels at arm’s length. ‘The heat’s put paid to these rations. Now we’re really in for a hard time.’</p>
<p>The colony reacts to the news of the spoiled food with silent disbelief. What little that can be saved is carefully shared out, but it amounts to barely a day’s rations per person. ‘If we don’t find some food to replace what we’ve lost,’ says Aunt Betty-Ann, as she distributes the last of the stone-hard bread. ‘It’ll be a convoy of skeletons that drives into Big Spring.’</p>
<p>‘Well, at least we’ve got enough water,’ replies Pop Ewell. ‘We can live for three weeks without food, but we’d all be dead in three days without water.’</p>

<p>A solitary open window, criss-crossed with pitted steel bars, provides the only source of light and ventilation in the cell. Standing on the edge of the wooden bunk you are able to peer through the bars at an alleyway that runs along the rear of the building. But without your weapons, or any other means of dislodging the bars, you cannot hope to escape this way.</p>
<p>An hour later you hear your captors laughing in the corridor outside. A key rattles in the lock and the cell door swings back to reveal a barrel-chested clansman, clad in a suit of black leather, which is adorned with sharpened metal studs. He fixes you with his small, bloodshot eyes and sneers contemptuously.</p>
<p>‘You scoutin’ for the Skulls, ain’t you, boy?’ he says, his hand caressing the butt of a pistol that is holstered on his hip. ‘That ’roach Alcatraz sent you here t’check us out, didn’t he?’ Resentful mutterings fill the corridor outside, urging the beady-eyed clansman to settle the matter by shooting you.</p>
<p>‘Do I look like a Skull?’ you ask, defensively.</p>
<p>‘Maybe not,’ he growls, ‘but if you ain’t a Skull, what you doing nosin’ around Albany?’</p>
<p>You choose your words with care, managing to convince the clansman and his cohorts that you are a loner, desperately short of food and water, who ran across their town by chance and decided to enter in search of supplies. The clansman, who calls himself Manhattan, seems impressed by your story and invites you to join his gang, which is known as the ‘Kickers’. You have little option but to accept his invitation in the hope that once you are released from the cell you will be able to escape.</p>
<p>‘Good!’ snarls Manhattan. He informs his men of your decision and orders them to make preparations for ‘the Rite’. When you ask what ‘the Rite’ is, he narrows his eyes and sniggers. ‘You must earn the right to become a Kicker,’ he says, grimly. ‘You must prove to us that you are worthy.’</p>

<p>As soon as Cutter has the engine running smoothly and everyone is back on board the bus, you return to your roadster and lead them west to Weatherford.</p>
<p>As the afternoon wears on, the rays of the sun cast a blood-red hue on the surrounding landscape. Ahead, the freeway cuts a straight line due west, towards the high peaks of the Edwards Plateau that pierce the horizon like a row of sharpened flints, jagged and blue. You stare into the distance, trying to relax and not think about the dangers you have faced today, or the unknown perils that lie ahead.</p>

He has located a broadcast on his CB radio set, and he is as excited as a youngster on Christmas morning. ‘Listen to this,’ he says, holding up the earphones.

<p>Carefully, Kate examines a package she has removed from the saddle-bag. It is about the size of a man’s shoe, covered with a shiny black plastic wrapping, and has a keypad and timer attached to its side.</p>
<p>‘Well, it looks like we got ourselves one mighty big fire-cracker here,’ she says, offering it to you for inspection.</p>
<p>‘What is it?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘About seven pounds of military grade Zevatec explosive; enough to make a hole the size of this lake.’</p>
<p>‘That’s some fire-cracker!’ you reply, uneasily.</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry, it’s safe,’ she assures you, taking the explosive from your trembling hands. ‘I saw the Lions use this stuff in Oklahoma. It’s as stable as clay until you prime and time it, then…boom! I think I’ll hang on to it. It could come in useful.’ She slips the Zevatec into her bag and then walks back towards the lake.</p>

<p>You pull your T-shirt up to cover your nose and mouth before venturing out into the storm. Visibility is less than five yards and, with the dust constantly gusting into your eyes, you must rely heavily on your sense of hearing for some indication of the child’s location. Repeatedly you call out her name, hoping she will reply, yet all you hear is the incessant howling of the wind.</p>
<p>A wide avenue leads you to a baseball park on the edge of the school grounds. For a few seconds the wind drops and you are able to see a small grocery store on the other side of the avenue, its front door hanging off its hinges. You can make out a thin, faint sound coming from inside the store.</p>
<p>You run towards the entrance, eager to get inside before the wind picks up and you lose sight of the building altogether. The stench of rotting food assails your nostrils the moment you enter the store, making your stomach churn, but you force yourself to ignore it and continue your search. You call Maria’s name and hear the sound again: it is coming from behind the cellar door. In the eerie half-light you find the latch and lift it. ‘Don’t be afraid, Maria. It’s Cal,’ you say, hoping to reassure and comfort the girl, but when you push open the door it is not little Maria who greets you.</p>

<p>There is a rush of wind, like a sound of a whip before it cracks; then something tightens around your body, pinning your arms to your sides. Fear wells up inside when you realize that you have been lassoed. Desperately you struggle to grab the rope that is biting into your flesh, but you are pulled roughly to the ground before you can break free.</p>
<p>Cursing wildly, you blink the dust from your eyes in time to see a scrawny youth advancing towards you, his hands tugging and shortening the rope to maintain his hold on you. He is dressed in tattered buckskin, and his cheeks and forehead are painted with coloured stripes. His strange appearance reminds you of books you read when you were young—books with pictures of Red Indian braves who fought cowboys of the old West. The youth gives a warbling scream and more of his kind appear, all of them dressed in similar Red Indian costumes. With howls of delight they jump on you, take your missile and close combat weapons (erase these from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>), and hold your arms securely behind your back while the youth retrieves his lasso. Then, without a word of explanation, they drag you to the centre of the street and tie you to the totem pole.</p>

<p>‘Yeah,’ replies the girl, her voice shaky, ‘though not by choice.’</p>
<p>As you race back along the highway to McKinney, the girl, whose name is Kate Norton, tells you about the events leading up to your meeting. She comes from Kansas City and was one of the lucky few who managed to survive there since the holocaust. A month ago her colony was attacked and wiped out by a gang of motorcycle renegades called ‘the Lions’. Their leader, who calls himself ‘Mad Dog Michigan’, took a liking to her and spared her life. He was once a high-ranking HAVOC agent who had escaped from Pontiac Deep Pen near Detroit, and he and his gang, most of whom were also HAVOC escapees, were heading for the Fort Hood Military Reserve near Killeen, the largest armoury in the whole of the United States.</p>
<p>‘He hopes to find enough weapons and ammunition there to equip the other HAVOC clans who are in control of cities all along the eastern seaboard. Once he’s armed his army he’ll take over the rest of the country,’ she says, her blue eyes brimming with tears. ‘Three days ago the Lions reached Oklahoma City. They were desperate for food, so Mad Dog decided to camp there and forage the surrounding area. Until then I’d always been kept closely guarded, but while most of them were away I managed to steal a bike and escape. I was beginning to think I’d made it. I was wrong. I ran out of fuel just north of Sherman and had to ditch the bike. I met up with your friend this morning when he walked into town. Soon after he’d told me all about you and your colony and your plans to head west, those guys back there arrived. Mad Dog sent them to find me.’ She pauses to wipe her tears and brush the tangle of windswept blonde hair away from her beautiful face.</p>
<p>‘I’m really sorry about what happened to Long Jake. It’s all my fault.’</p>
<p>‘Don’t blame yourself,’ you say, trying to console her. ‘It’s over now. Once we get back to DC1 and take off for Big Spring, Mad Dog and his gang will be just a bad memory.’</p>

An hour slips past, and you are just about to turn around and rejoin the others, when you happen upon a section of the bank that slopes gently towards the river. You stop the car and start walking towards it, hopefully. Standing at the water’s edge, you see that the river is unusually dark. You decide to test its depth and begin to wade across, but you have taken less than a dozen steps and the water is already up to your chin. Sadly you return to the bank.</p>

<p>You are soon swallowed up in the network of narrow alleyways, and are able to shake off the few clansmen who attempted to pursue you. Eventually you emerge onto a wider street that is lined with dilapidated stores. Rather than take the risk of staying on the street, you decide to hide in one of these buildings and wait until the heat dies down. Fortunately you choose a hardware store that still has a cache of stock hidden on the first floor, and you discover the following items that could prove useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two Knives (2)</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 Rifle</strong></li>
<li><strong>Six rounds of 7.62mm ammunition</strong></li>
<li>Enough food for <strong>two Meals</strong></li>
<li>Enough medical supplies for <strong>three Medi-kit units</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>If you decide to keep any of these items be sure to adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>From a window on the first floor, you watch as a large group of Indian clansmen pour out of an alley opposite. They divide into two groups and begin searching the adjoining street, seemingly convinced that you are still out in the open. Silently you crouch by the window, awaiting the chance to slip out of Cross Plains unseen. While you are lying low, you must take a Drink or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>It is dusk before you are able to escape from the town. With relief you discover that your roadster is still parked at the gas station where you left it, and quickly you climb in and accelerate away.</p>
<p>When you reach Rising Star you find that the convoy is awaiting your return with trepidation. Because you are so long overdue, they feared that you had fallen foul of Mad Dog Michigan and his bikers. You tell them what happened to you in Cross Plains and everyone agrees that, with darkness almost upon you, it is too dangerous to continue.</p>
<p>The night at Rising Star passes uneventfully, and at first light the convoy sets off cross-country towards Abilene. The arid, stony bed of Pecan Bayou provides excellent cover from the surrounding high ground and leads the convoy northwest, back towards Interstate 20. It is shortly after midday when you reach the freeway, from which you can see the outskirts of Abilene less than five miles distant.</p>

<p>You get to your feet and start off towards the platform at the centre of the bridge, weaving back and forth as you run in order to present the advancing clansmen with a difficult target. But you have covered barely twenty yards when the fatigue of your ordeal suddenly catches up with you. You cannot catch your breath and your legs feel like they are clothed in lead. You stumble and fall. For a while you crawl on your hands and knees; then you stagger painfully to your feet as you near the platform. The colony screams encouragement from the other side of the river, inspiring you to greater effort, but suddenly a line of bullets cuts across your path and you feel a terrible pain in your back. Rapidly the pain fades, giving way to a numbness that spreads through the lower half of your body. Unable to feel your legs, you are helpless to prevent yourself from falling off the edge of the platform into the Colorado River.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the sun dips below the horizon, relinquishing its reign to a full moon and a clear night sky. The landscape is shrouded in a ghostly twilight and, as the miles slip past, the temperature steadily drops.</p>
<p>It takes a little over twenty minutes to reach Mineral Wells. It seems no different to a handful of other towns through which you have passed today: it is derelict, decayed, and deserted. As you drive along the main street, you scan the rooftops in search of a radio mast, and, almost immediately, you discover what you seek. On the roof of a three-storey building at the end of the street is the tripod-like structure. The upper section of the mast has long since collapsed, but the remaining lower section is still intact, sufficient in length to carry a call-signal as far as Weatherford.</p>
<p>Stopping outside the building, you fasten your jacket against the chill night air; then you enter to find the dusty halls and offices of a commercial radio station awaiting you. In a studio at the top of the building you discover what you are looking for. Slumped over a control panel is the body of Doctor Drool, former ace DJ and anchor-man of Radio KLFM. Beneath his skeletal hand is the button that controls the station call-sign, a transmission that has played continuously for the last eight years.</p>

You see a second flash, brighter than the first, and feel something punch you hard in the chest.

<p>With a squeal of tyres, you accelerate away, retracing your route along Interstate 20 towards the convoy. As you drive, you are haunted by images of the two Rad-vics that you encountered at the trench: the chilling memory of their gaunt, grey faces has awakened your deepest fears. The road crests a rise and you see the convoy parked less than a quarter of a mile away. The welcoming sight distracts you from your morbid thoughts, but the relief is to be short-lived.</p>

Looks like that Mad Dog Michigan decided not to go to Killeen after all!’</p>
<p>‘I think we should head for Cisco and lay low until they pass,’ says Uncle Jonas, but he soon changes his mind when you tell him about your encounter at the trench.</p>
<p>‘Abilene would be safer,’ says Kate, leaning out of a window of the bus. ‘But we’ll have to pass wide of Cisco to get there.’</p>
<p>Cutter convenes a hasty conference to decide the best way to reach Abilene. The terrain in this area is too rocky to attempt a cross-country detour at speed, so you must use what little remains of the secondary highways in order to reach your goal. After studying the <a href="#map">map</a> and staring at the surrounding plain from the roof of the bus, you determine two possible routes: northwest via the town of Albany, or southwest via the town of Cross Plains.

Then in the next instant you feel a tremendous jolt as your roadster hits the rifleman and sends his broken body spinning through the air. You brace yourself against the wheel, but Kate is thrown forwards against the dashboard and gashes her forehead. At first you fear that she is badly injured, but quickly she staunches the wound with dressings from her Medi-kit, and then reloads her empty shotgun.</p>

<p>The instant you set foot in the store, two hands reach out of the darkness, grab you by the jacket lapels and pull you away from the doorway. Immediately, there is a long burst of fire and a hail of bullets scythes the air where you were standing only moments before.</p>
<p>‘These ain’t no ordinary punks,’ growls Long Jake, peering cautiously over the edge of the bullet-shattered window frame. ‘They’re scouts for a Yankee gang that’s headin’ this way, looking to take over. They’re a mite anxious to get their hands on her, too,’ he says, nodding towards the girl who is crouching behind the store counter, her eyes wide with fright.</p>
<p>‘What do they want with her?’ you ask, but before Long Jake can reply there is a flash and a deafening explosion. The store’s rear door is blown inwards and a searing wave of heat and flying debris knocks you off your feet. Stunned by the blast, you rise unsteadily and reach for a weapon. A grey shape fills the rear entrance, its outline fuzzy in the smoke and dust that hover there. Then the shape draws into focus and you see the silhouette of a tall man, lean and sinewy, his thin mouth set in a cruel sneer.</p>
<p>‘Look out!’ screams Long Jake, as the figure leaps through the doorway, a shotgun held before him ready to fire.</p>

As the fiery shells rip through your cover, you fight the urge to throw yourself down on the ground, and take aim at the approaching vehicle.

<p class="deadend">Your life and your journey end here.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice about the dingy cell is the solitary open window, criss-crossed with pitted steel bars, that provides the only source of light and ventilation. Standing on the edge of the wooden bunk, you are able to peer through the bars at an alleyway that runs along the rear of the building. The bars themselves are badly corroded and, after a few minutes’ work, you are able to break and bend enough of them to enable you to escape.</p>
<p>At the end of the alleyway you discover a derelict timber yard where, behind a stack of rotten fencing posts, you crouch, waiting for the chance to slip out of Albany. While you are lying low, you must take a drink or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>In the distance you see the sun resting on the peak of Signal Mountain, and you estimate that no more than an hour of daylight remains. Then a freeway mileage sign looms into view, its paint blistered and barely legible. You slow down and read:</p>
<div class="signpost">Big Spring 16 mls</div>
<p>The sign coaxes a cheer from those aboard the bus and renews your hopes of completing the first stage of your long journey west. A few miles further on you see another sign. This announces that you are approaching the town of Coahoma. With the memory of what happened at Westbrook still fresh in your mind, you decide to bring the convoy to a halt.</p>

<p>You raise your arm and fire your shotgun without aiming. The speed of your reflexes and the spread of the Double-A target load guarantee that your enemy will never point his pistol at anyone again.

<p>You have aimed too low: your gunfire hits the stone parapet of the roof, alerting the sniper to your position. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Quickly he lifts his assault rifle, swings the barrel around towards the factory, and focuses on your window.

<p>Seething with anger you watch as the remaining biker climbs astride his machine and kicks it into life. You rush forward in a brave but hopeless attempt to save Kate from being abducted: the Maverick clansman accelerates away before you can even get near. As you watch his fleeing form disappear into the night, you promise yourself that you will get Kate back, no matter what it takes. You run towards your roadster, determined to follow him and rescue Kate, but your plans are frustrated when the bus pulls up close by and Cutter shouts a warning. ‘There’s a whole mess o’ lights headin’ this way, Cal. I’m sure it’s the Lions. We’ve got to move now or they’ll catch us before we get inside Big Spring.’ Reluctantly you agree with Cutter. It would be madness to drive alone into the Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>The convoy enters the fortified gates of Big Spring and receives a rapturous welcome from the colonists of the settlement. The mood is celebratory, for your arrival marks the start of an alliance that is destined to grow stronger over the forthcoming months. You have completed the first stage of your difficult journey and, although your achievement is overshadowed by Kate’s abduction, your mission is a success.</p>
<p>For you, Cal Phoenix, champion and protector of Dallas Colony 1, the journey continues in Book 2 of the <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> series, entitled:</p>

<li>Add to your <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> any extra points gained through use of a close combat weapon.</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> score of your enemy from your total. The resulting number is the Combat Ratio.</li>

<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Close Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio along the top of the chart and cross-reference it with the random number you have picked. (E indicates enemy’s loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. CP indicates Cal Phoenix’s loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from stage 3 until one combatant has zero <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or below; this is when he is declared dead.</li>

<h3><a name="smevazn">To Evade Combat</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>You may only evade combat when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>If the text offers the chance of taking evasive action instead of entering into combat, you may evade in the first round of combat or in any subsequent round.</li>
<li>If you decide to evade after a round of combat, ignore all points lost by the enemy in that round: only Cal Phoenix loses <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
