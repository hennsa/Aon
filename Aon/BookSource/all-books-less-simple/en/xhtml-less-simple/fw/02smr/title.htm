<div class="frontmatter">

   <p>You are Cal Phoenix, the Freeway Warrior, champion and protector of Dallas Colony One. From the sanctuary of Big Spring your convoy of survivors begins the next stage of its life-or-death exodus: a journey to the fortified border town of El Paso, a destination that lies hundreds of miles beyond the sun-scorched wasteland of West Texas. In <strong><cite>Slaughter Mountain Run</cite></strong>, your mission is to rescue Kate Norton from the clutches of your arch enemy—the HAVOC leader Mad Dog Michigan. You have just seven days to free her and to rendezvous with the colony before it runs the gauntlet of fire that protects the only mountain road to El Paso.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels and the Freeway Warrior adventure books, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. Brian also illustrated three of the four books in Joe Dever’s <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> series.</p>

<h2><a name="dtd">Dateline to Disaster</a></h2>

<p><strong>1990–1998</strong><br />
    Rise of global terrorism on an unprecedented scale. Political violence funded by organized crime syndicate called HAVOC—The Hijack, Assassination, and Violent Opposition Consortium.</p>
<p><strong>1998–2003</strong><br />
    The governments of many small and impoverished nations fall into the hands of HAVOC. International terrorists receive arms, training, and shelter in these ‘Badlands’.</p>
<p><strong>2003–2008</strong><br />
    Raids on oil and gas installations, assassinations, and the kidnapping of prominent world statesmen become commonplace as HAVOC attempts to terrorize the civilized world into submission. Despite public outrage and growing international tension, the major powers steadfastly refuse to give in to HAVOC’s demands.</p>
<p><strong>2008</strong><br />
    President of the United States and General Secretary of Supreme Soviet both assassinated at emergency summit meeting. US, USSR, and major European nations create the World Defence League and declare war on HAVOC. The Badlands are invaded, key HAVOC bases destroyed, and thousands of HAVOC agents are captured.</p>
<p><strong>2009</strong><br />
    HAVOC leaders imprisoned for life in ‘Deep Pens’—maximum security gaols located deep underground—to prevent their escape or release by HAVOC agents still at large.</p>
<p><strong>2010</strong><br />
    New leadership emerges to unify the scattered remnants of HAVOC and plan revenge.</p>
<p><strong>2011</strong><br />
    A WDL train transporting seventeen 100-kiloton nuclear warheads, slated to be neutralized and dismantled, is attacked by HAVOC agents. The train is destroyed and its deadly cargo stolen.</p>
<p><strong>2012 New Year’s Day</strong><br />
    HAVOC hijacks a WDL news satellite and broadcasts a chilling ultimatum. They have planted the seventeen stolen warheads in major cities throughout the US, USSR, and Europe. They call for the immediate release of all HAVOC agents held in Deep Pens, plus the payment of $2 trillion in gold bullion, or they will trigger the warheads one by one until their demands are met in full. A twenty-four hour deadline is set. WDL leaders declare an emergency and request that the deadline be extended. HAVOC refuses.</p>
<p><strong>2nd January</strong><br />
    First warhead detonated at Brie Nuclear Energy Plant, ten miles south of Paris, France. Blast and radioactive fallout claim millions of lives. HAVOC repeats its demand and extends deadline by twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>3rd January ‘The Day’</strong><br />
    World Defence League agents discover location of HAVOC command headquarters on an island in the South Pacific Ocean. Immediately orders are given to infiltrate and destroy the HQ and its occupants. The assault is swift and decisive; the complex is quickly overrun and its inhabitants are killed. Yet, ironically, as the news of this victory is being relayed around the world, HAVOC enacts its ultimate revenge. A transmitter hidden on the island, fitted with a time-delay mechanism, clicks on, sending its high-frequency radio signal to a communications satellite orbiting the earth. This signal is amplified and returned to earth where, simultaneously, it triggers the remaining nuclear warheads. The initial explosions set off a disastrous chain reaction that feeds on civil and military nuclear installations all across the northern hemisphere. Hundreds of millions of people are killed within days, and many more perish during the years that follow, falling victim to the lingering radioactivity and the severe climatic changes that affect the earth.</p>
<p><strong>2012–2019</strong><br />
    Gale force winds sweep across the world, carrying enormous amounts of dust into the upper atmosphere and preventing much sunlight from reaching the earth’s surface. Temperatures plummet, deterring survivors from remaining above ground. Communications are disrupted by gamma radiation, making all radio, cable, and satellite contact impossible. Small colonies of survivors develop in total isolation from one another during these years of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>2019–2020</strong><br />
    Gradually, the dust storms die down and the sun penetrates the atmosphere, thawing the earth’s frozen surface. Radiation has decayed to tolerable levels, and survivors emerge to reclaim what little remains of the world they once knew.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far</a></h2>

<p>You are Cal Phoenix, a survivor, born in California on Thanksgiving Day in the year AD 2000. In 2012, whilst on winter vacation at your Uncle Jonas’ and Aunt Betty-Ann’s ranch in Texas, you were invited to visit a shale-oil mine near Austin, the first of its kind in Texas. As Chief of Construction, your uncle was proud to take you on a guided tour of the whole underground complex, which, for security reasons, was totally self-supporting. It was during this tour on 3 January 2012 that the unthinkable happened.</p>
<p>You remember how the ground shuddered when the shock waves from the first distant explosions reached the mine. Immediately you assumed it was the start of an earthquake, which you had experienced many times at home in California. However, as the levels nearest the surface began to collapse and the central elevator shaft filled with rubble, you realized the awful truth: the holocaust. At first there was no way of telling the extent of the surface devastation. Below ground, the safety generators had switched into operation automatically when the main power supply failed, and the tremors had faded quickly, which encouraged your aunt and uncle to believe that the damage above was superficial. Uncle Jonas was confident that the military would mount a rescue operation and that you would be brought out within a few days, a week at the most. Aunt Betty-Ann, too, was optimistic. After all, there were emergency supplies—enough to feed 200 men for a whole month. Little did she know that the three of you would end up consuming all those supplies, or that the mine would become your home, your shelter, and your prison for the next eight years of your lives.</p>
<p>It was early September in the year 2019 when eventually you broke through to the surface. When first you set eyes on the landscape surrounding the mine, it was like looking at the surface of another planet. Few structures had survived the blizzards and intense cold that had swept around the world in the years following ‘The Day’, and now, after the dust had settled and the sun had returned, the once-fertile plains of Austin resembled little more than a desert of parched and broken rock, littered with the artefacts of an absent civilization.</p>
<p>During the first few days, when you set out to explore this wilderness, it was easy to believe that you were the only survivors. But on the morning of the fifth day Uncle Jonas made chance radio contact with a family called Ewell who were living near the ruins of McKinney, thirty miles north of Dallas. They told him that they had been in touch with a handful of other groups who had managed somehow to survive the holocaust. Most were isolated and unable to move due to lack of fuel, food, or water. They had urged those who could travel to join them in McKinney to start a new community there, and some people were already on their way. When your uncle and aunt accepted their invitation, the Ewells were enthusiastic, but they also warned you to be wary—not everyone who had survived wanted to establish a new community. The ruins of some large Texan cities, such as Dallas and Fort Worth, were controlled by gangs of criminals who fought with each other and terrorized anyone seeking to reestablish law and order. They urged you to avoid these gangs at all costs.</p>
<p>It took more than a week to discover a vehicle that could transport you to McKinney. It was an old school bus, one that had been parked in an underground lot and had survived the years of sub-zero blizzards. With fuel and spares salvaged from the mine, you managed to coax it back to life, and then set off on your journey north.</p>
<p>When you arrived at the town, it was easy to find where the Ewells lived—their ranch was the only place that was still standing. It looked more like an old frontier post than a ranch, with its fortified perimeter wall, lookout posts, and stake-filled moat. However, after being ambushed and shot at by the city gangs of Fort Worth during the final stages of your journey, you fully appreciated the need for these defences.</p>
<p>‘Pop’ Ewell, the seventy-year-old grandfather of the Ewell family, was the leader of this small colony of survivors, and it was he who had urged Uncle Jonas to join them when they had first made radio contact. The colony numbered less than a dozen at the time of your arrival, yet, as the airwaves became clearer and new contacts were made, soon this number had more than doubled to twenty-five. It was decided that a name was needed to identify the settlement. The name ‘Dallas Colony One’ was adopted, known as ‘DC1’ for short. From that day on, everyone worked hard to make DC1 a secure haven for those seeking refuge from the hostile wastelands and marauding city gangs.</p>
<p>‘Cutter’ Jacks was one such refugee. Before ‘The Day’ he had been chief mechanic at the International Grand Prix Circuit near Lake Dallas, and his incredible skill with, and knowledge of, engines was soon to prove invaluable to the colony. He taught you how to drive, and from a pile of old wrecks that you helped him salvage from the circuit, he built you a powerful, customized car. You used it to patrol the highways north of the city, keeping a lookout for gangs of city punks who frequently mounted raids to steal or destroy DC1’s supplies. Cutter also taught you to shoot. It was your natural prowess with a gun, and your skill behind the wheel, that was to earn you the begrudging respect of your enemies, who took to calling you the ‘Freeway Warrior’.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small3.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Six months after you arrived at DC1, the colony was faced with a major crisis. A heat wave was causing a drought that threatened to destroy the food supply. Crops were failing and the colony’s artesian well, its only source of uncontaminated water, was beginning to dry up. The drought was also provoking more attacks from the city punks, who were desperate for food and water. Their common need had united them and now they posed a very real threat to the security of DC1.</p>
<p>It was the last day of May 2020, when Pop Ewell made radio contact with another colony who were based in the city of Big Spring, 300 miles west of McKinney. Their situation was completely the reverse of DC1’s: they had food and water in plentiful supply but they were desperately short of fuel. They told of their contact with survivors in Tucson, Arizona, who were also without fuel. The Tucson colony reported that the territories west of the mountains of the Sierra Nevada had been spared the worst effects of the radioactive blizzards that had devastated the rest of the country and, miraculously, much of southern California was still widely populated. In fact, it had survived the last eight years virtually intact. When you heard the news you could hardly believe your ears. Perhaps your family was still alive. After all that had happened, there was now a real hope that one day you might be reunited with them.</p>
<p>A meeting was held to decide how best to deal with the crisis facing DC1. Everyone agreed that to stay at McKinney would lead eventually to death, either slowly from starvation or suddenly at the hands of the murderous city gangs. The only choice open to DC1 was to try to reach California; only there lay real hope for the future of the colony. The decision was relayed to the survivors at Big Spring and a deal was struck to rendezvous with them as soon as possible. DC1 would refuel them in exchange for food and water, and together they would join up with the Tucson colony for the final stage of the journey to California.</p>
<p>Careful preparations were made for the long trek, and three vehicles were chosen to make up the convoy: the school bus, your customized roadster, and a gasolene tanker laden with 5000 gallons of petroleum siphoned from underground storage tanks at the Ewell ranch. Supplies of food and water were adequate but the colony lacked sufficient firearms and ammunition with which to defend itself. So, on the day before the convoy was due to leave, one of the colonists was sent north to search the town of Sherman for weapons. He radioed back to say that he had found a cache of hunting rifles and ammunition, but that his truck had broken down and he was stranded in the town. He had also found a survivor—a beautiful teenage girl—and he requested that you be sent to Sherman to pick them up. As soon as you arrived you were ambushed by the scouts of a brutal gang of bikers known as the Detroit Lions and, in the ensuing gun battle, you killed Stinger—the scouts’ leader.</p>
<p>Later, you learned that the girl, Kate Norton, was the sole survivor of a Kansas City colony, which had been attacked and wiped out by the Detroit Lions. The Lions’ leader, who calls himself ‘Mad Dog Michigan’, had taken a liking to her and spared her life. Mad Dog had once been a high-ranking HAVOC agent. He had escaped from Pontiac Deep Pen near Detroit, and he and his gang, most of whom were also HAVOC escapees, were heading for the Fort Hood Military Reserve near Killeen, Texas, the largest armoury in the whole of the United States. There he hoped to find enough weapons to equip the other HAVOC clans who were now in control of cities all along the eastern seaboard. Kate had managed to steal a motorcycle and escape from their camp, but Mad Dog had been determined to get her back. He sent his brother—Stinger—and a handful of his best scouts to track her down. They had finally caught up with her at Sherman.</p>
<p>When Mad Dog learned that you had killed his brother, he vowed to get even with you at any price. He abandoned his plans to loot Fort Hood and embarked instead on a relentless pursuit of your colony as it crossed the sun-scorched wastelands of central Texas. The journey to Big Spring was fraught with great danger. Yet, in spite of the many perils you faced, or perhaps because of them, you felt yourself falling in love with Kate and you sensed that she, too, was becoming increasingly fond of you.</p>
<p>Sadly, the convoy was only a few miles from Big Spring when disaster struck. The land surrounding the settlement was controlled by a gang of bikers, a renegade clan called the ‘Mavericks’ who had been the bane of the Big Spring colony for many months. As the convoy drew nearer to its destination, the Mavericks launched an attack, and, in the running battle that ensued, they captured and abducted Kate. The convoy entered the fortified gates of Big Spring to a rapturous welcome from the colonists of that settlement, but for you the mood of celebration was soured by the vivid memory of Kate’s abduction. You vowed to rescue her, and, from that moment on, every waking minute of every day at Big Spring was spent thinking about little else.</p>
<p>By chance it transpired that the leader of the Mavericks, a blond-haired murderer called Amex Gold, was a former HAVOC agent who had served under Mad Dog Michigan before ‘The Day’. He offered to join forces with the Lions, and, as a token of his loyalty to his former commander, he returned Kate to him. Together, the Lions and the Mavericks launched a hasty attack on Big Spring. However, although they outnumbered the colony by more than three to one, they were unable to breach the settlement’s fortified perimeter wall, and were repelled with heavy losses.</p>
<p>On the day after the attack, Pop Ewell discovered the radio frequency that the clansmen were using and was able to eavesdrop on their communications. He learned that Mad Dog had ordered another HAVOC clan, based in New Orleans, to come and reinforce his command; they were expected to arrive within the week. He also overheard Mad Dog arrange a meeting with Mekong Mike, the leader of the Angelinos, a gang that controlled the city of San Angelo. He wanted him as an ally and was prepared to offer guns and ammunition in return for his help in destroying the Big Spring colony.</p>
<p>Two days later, Mad Dog Michigan set off for San Angelo at the head of a motorcycle pack 200 riders strong. Those few clansmen who remained with Amex Gold tried myriad tricks to convince the colony that the Mavericks and the Lions still surrounded Big Spring in strength, but to no avail. The senior members of the newly-enlarged colony convened a meeting at which it was decided that, with the clansmen now at their weakest, and with the appearance of the New Orleans gang expected at any time, a breakout had to be attempted without delay.</p>
<p>There is only one way for the colony to reach Tucson overland and that is to follow the remains of Interstate Freeway 10 through the arid, mountainous territory of western Texas. Precisely halfway between Big Spring and Tucson is situated the city of El Paso, which is chosen as the colony’s first destination. The city lies at the end of a long, steep, and tortuous stretch of mountain highway, and few doubt that the journey to El Paso will prove the most exacting test of strength and endurance any of you are ever likely to face during your long journey to California.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>Before embarking on your adventure, you must first determine your personal characteristics and the weapons and provisions with which you are equipped. An <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> has been supplied on which to record and amend these details as the adventure unfolds.</p>
<p>Your personal characteristics comprise two basic attributes: <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small>. To discover your initial <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small>, take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero. Add 10 to the number you have picked and write the total in the <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (for example, if your pencil falls on the number 5 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, you have a <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> total of 15). When you fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, your <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> will be measured against that of your enemy, so a high score in this section is desirable.</p>
<p>To discover your <small>ENDURANCE</small> level, repeat the process, but this time add 20 to the number you have picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (for example, if your pencil falls on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, you have a total <small>ENDURANCE</small> score of 28). If you are wounded in combat, or injured at any other time during your adventure, you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If, at any time, your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. You can regain lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during the course of the adventure, but your <small>ENDURANCE</small> level can never rise above your initial score.</p>
<h3><a name="sskills">Survival Skills</a></h3>

<p>Ever since the day you returned to the surface, you have endeavoured to develop your skills and natural instincts fully in order to best defend yourself and your colony.</p>
<p>Listed on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> are your five basic Survival Skills:</p>
<h4><a name="driving">Driving</a></h4>

<p>Your ability to control powered vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks.</p>
<h4><a name="shooting">Shooting</a></h4>

<p>Your familiarity and experience in the use of missile weapons, such as pistols, machine pistols, shotguns, and rifles.</p>
<h4><a name="fldcraft">Field craft</a></h4>

<p>Your knowledge and experience of all aspects of outdoor survival.</p>
<h4><a name="stealth">Stealth</a></h4>

<p>Your physical fitness, the speed of your reflexes, and your dexterity.</p>
<h4><a name="perceptn">Perception</a></h4>

<p>Your intelligence, your ability to evaluate information, your education, and your mental alertness.</p>
<p>Your ability in each of these five individual skills is measured in skill points. You begin with 3 points per skill. Before starting the adventure, you may allocate an additional 4 skill points to your list of five Survival Skills. These 4 extra points can be used to improve one or more of your five skills. During your adventure, all five skills will be severely tested; therefore the higher the individual skill level, the better your chances of survival. You may allocate your 4 additional points entirely how you like.</p>
<p>When you have decided where to allocate your 4 additional skill points, make a note of the totals in the Survival Skills section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>(If this is your first <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> adventure, your total number of skill points should be 19: five skills x 3 points each = 15, plus 4 additional skill points = 19 points.)</p>
<p>If you complete successfully the mission set in Book 2 of the <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> series, you may add an additional 4 points to your Survival Skills in Book 3. These additional points, together with any equipment and provisions that you possess at the end of Book 2, may then be used in the next <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> adventure, which is called <a href="../../fw/03toz/title.htm#title"><cite>The Omega Zone</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Apart from your clothing, a number of useful items form your basic equipment. This comprises a Backpack and a belt on which hang your Ammo Pouch, Medi-kit, Water Canteen, and Hunting Knife. In addition to these items, you possess a <a href="#map">Map of Western Texas</a>, which you carry tucked inside your leather jacket.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4><a name="backpack">Backpack</a></h4>

<p>Up to ten separate items may be stored and carried in your Backpack at any time. However, if more than three items are carried, your Stealth level will be reduced by 1 point. If more than six items are carried, your Stealth level will be reduced by 2 points; and if you carry a full Backpack (containing ten items), your Stealth level will be reduced by 3 points.</p>
<p>In order to equip yourself for the task ahead, you may choose up to four items from the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar Torch</li>
<li>HE (High Explosive) Grenade</li>
<li>Binoculars</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>CB Radio</li>
<li>Rope</li>
<li>3 Meals (each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack)</li>
<li>Flexible Saw</li>
<li>Signal Flare</li>
</ul>
<p>List the items you have chosen on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have picked four items, adjust your current Stealth level accordingly.</p>
<p>Opportunities may arise during your adventure for you to pick up useful items. These items will appear in the text in bold print and, unless you are instructed otherwise, they can be stored and carried in your Backpack.</p>
<p>You will need to eat regularly. If you do not possess any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<h4><a name="ammpouch">Ammo Pouch</a></h4>

<p>Your Ammo Pouch is where you store any spare ammunition for firearms. It can hold a maximum of the following:</p>
<p>
         40 rounds of 9mm calibre Pistol/Machine Pistol ammunition<br />
         or<br />
         20 rounds of 7.62mm calibre Rifle ammunition<br />
         or<br />
         10 rounds of 12-gauge calibre Shotgun ammunition<br />
        </p>
<p>When carrying mixed calibres of ammunition, use this equation to check how much space you have left in your Ammo Pouch:</p>
<p>4 x 9mm rounds = 2 x 7.62 rounds = 1 x 12 gauge round</p>
<p>Additional ammunition can be carried in your Backpack. Ammunition occupies one space for each quantity that is equal to (or less than) the maximum that can be carried in one Ammo Pouch.</p>
<h4><a name="medikit">Medi-kit</a></h4>

<p>A well-stocked Medi-kit can make all the difference to your chances of survival should you suffer injury in the field or as a result of combat. It contains useful first aid supplies, such as dressings, antiseptics, antibiotics, water purification tablets, sulfonamides, pain killers, potassium iodide tablets (to delay absorption of radioactivity), and sutures.</p>
<p>For convenience, these medical supplies are grouped into units. To find how many units you have in your Medi-kit, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> (0 equals 10) and add 2. Your total score equals the number of units with which you begin your adventure. To keep a record of them, circle the appropriate number of unit symbols in the Medi-kit section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. The maximum number of units you can carry in your Medi-kit is twelve.</p>
<p>You may use your Medi-kit units to restore lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points; each unit used in this way restores 3 points. Units cannot be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in lieu of a Meal or Water when instructed to eat or drink.</p>
<h4><a name="canteen">Water Canteen</a></h4>

<p>Water is essential to life, and your life will depend on having a sufficient, uncontaminated supply. You will need to drink regularly during your adventure. One drink is equivalent to half a pint and your canteen holds exactly two pints of water: enough for one day’s needs. When instructed to drink, be sure to tick off one box in the Water section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have any Water when instructed to drink, you must lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<h3><a name="weapons">Weapons</a></h3>

<h4><a name="close">Close Combat Weapons</a></h4>

<p>These weapons aid you in hand-to-hand fighting. You begin your adventure armed with a Hunting Knife which, when used in close combat, adds 2 points to your <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small>. Note this Hunting Knife in the Close Combat Weapons section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you find a close combat weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. Close combat weapons will appear in the text with a close combat skill number, for example, Machete (3). This number indicates how many points this weapon will add to your <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> when used in a hand-to-hand fight.</p>
<p>The maximum number of close combat weapons you may carry is <em>two</em>, though you may only wield one at any time.</p>
<h4><a name="missile">Missile Weapons</a></h4>

<p>There are four types of missile weapon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pistol</li>
<li>Machine Pistol</li>
<li>Shotgun</li>
<li>Rifle</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you are continuing to use weapons from a previous <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> book, you begin your adventure armed with only one of these weapons. Make your choice and then record the weapon you have chosen, together with its calibre and rate of fire details, in the Missile Weapons section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>In order to be able to use a missile weapon, you must have sufficient ammunition of the correct calibre. The following list shows the calibre of each weapon, the amount that is used every time the weapon is fired, and the number of rounds that you possess at the start of your adventure:</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><th /><th>Calibre</th><th>Rate of Fire</th><th>Initial No. of Rounds</th></tr><tr><td>Pistol</td><td>9mm</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td>Machine Pistol</td><td>9mm</td><td align="center">6<sup><a href="#weapons-1-foot" name="weapons-1">2</a></sup></td><td align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td>Shotgun</td><td>12-gauge</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td>Rifle</td><td>7.62mm</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">4</td></tr></table>
<p>The initial number of rounds should be noted in the Ammo Pouch section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. Missile weapons cannot be used if you run out of ammunition or possess only rounds of the wrong calibre. However, the opportunity may arise for you to replenish your supply of ammunition and/or discover a weapon of the correct calibre.</p>
<p>You may carry a maximum of three missile weapons. However, for every missile weapon that you carry (excluding your initial choice), you must reduce your Stealth level by 1 point.</p>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Close Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions when you will have to fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy’s <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> level will both be given in the text. Your aim in close combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero or below while losing as few of your own <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible.</p>
<p>At the start of a close combat, enter both your own and your enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Close Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for close combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through the use of close combat weapons to your current <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />

         Example<br />
         Cal Phoenix (<small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> 17) is attacked by a Renegade Clansman (<small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> 18). He is not given the opportunity to evade close combat, but must stand and fight his adversary. Cal Phoenix is armed with a Hunting Knife, so he adds 2 points to his <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> of 19.<br />
        <br /><br />
He subtracts the Renegade Clansman’s <small>CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +1 (19 − 18 = +1). He notes this +1 on his <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>After working out your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Close Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the number that you have picked (the random numbers appear down the side of the chart). You now have the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Cal Phoenix and his enemy in this round of close combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; CP represents points lost by Cal Phoenix.)<br /><br />

         Example<br />
         The Combat Ratio between Cal Phoenix and the Renegade Clansman has been established as +1. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 4, then the result of the first round of close combat is:<br />
        <br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Cal Phoenix loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>Renegade Clansman loses 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the close combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, start the next round of close combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from stage 3.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This procedure continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Cal Phoenix are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Cal Phoenix is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Cal Phoenix proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">Summary of the Close Combat Rules</a> appears on the page after the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade close combat. If you have already engaged in a round of close combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored; only Cal Phoenix may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but that is the risk of running away! You may evade combat only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>Throughout a long and moonless night, the colony loads up and manhandles into line the vehicles that are to transport you west to Tucson. Preparations for the breakout did not begin until an hour after sundown, for Amex Gold has men positioned on nearby Signal Mountain with orders to observe and report all activity within Big Spring. These lookouts are especially vigilant; their leader is expecting the colony to attempt an escape and they know that their lives will be forfeit should they fail to predict exactly when it will occur.</p>
<p>In near-blackness you service and refuel your roadster by sense of touch alone, while all around you the chill night air is alive with movement and whispering as your fellow colonists furtively attend to their allotted tasks. Although you cannot see them, you know exactly the positions of the five other road vehicles that comprise the convoy. At the head of the line, twenty paces back from the west freeway gate, is the armoured tow truck that will lead the breakout. The driver is ‘Pecos’ Pete Tyler, and beside him you can picture his brother Rex riding shotgun. In the open back of their truck is Rickenbacker, a former flying circus stunt pilot, who has chosen to ride out in the open so that he can look after ‘Icarus’—his motorized hang glider—which by now he will have carefully dismantled and strapped aboard. Next in line are two Amcorp Landcruisers—solar-assisted road buses that carry the Big Spring colonists, and behind them is positioned the gasolene tanker with Uncle Jonas at the wheel. The DC1 school bus is next and your roadster last, the back marker until the convoy is clear of Big Spring.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="126" width="386" src="small1.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Once your preparations are complete you leave your vehicle and feel your way along the side of the school bus towards the boarding door. Cutter is sitting in the driver’s seat, staring thoughtfully at the night sky, his face lit by the faint green glow of the instrument panel.</p>
<p>‘Cal, you’d better get back and watch out for Pecos Pete’s signal,’ he says, on seeing you at his side. ‘We’re outta here in fifteen minutes.’</p>
<p>‘I’ve decided I’m not goin’ to Tucson with the convoy,’ you reply, your voice steady and resolute. ‘I’m not gonna abandon Kate. I’m the only hope she’s got of cuttin’ loose o’ that psychopath Mad Dog Michigan, and I’m not gonna betray that hope. He’s sure to have taken her with him to San Angelo, and I’ve thought out a plan to spring her from there while he’s busy fixin’ a deal with the Angelinos gang.’</p>
<p>‘I understand how you feel, Cal,’ says Cutter, sympathetically, ‘but you’ve a duty to the rest o’ the colony that you can’t just ignore. You’re the convoy scout, the convoy’s eyes and ears. We’re gonna need you to get us across the mountains in one piece.’</p>
<p>‘Rickenbacker in his micro-glider can scout for the convoy. With a CB on board he could stay in radio contact with Pop and be your eyes in the sky. He’d make the best scout the convoy could ask for,’ you reply, convincingly.</p>
<p>Cutter stares at you in silence. Begrudgingly, he nods in agreement. ‘OK, Cal. As soon as we’re safely away from here I’ll talk to the others and get them to listen to your plan. But first we’ve gotta concern ourselves with gettin’ out o’ here in one piece—agreed?’</p>
<p>‘Agreed,’ you reply, relieved that at last you have told someone your decision to rescue Kate.</p>
<p>Suddenly the discordant blare of an auto horn splits the silence: it is Pecos Pete’s signal to the other drivers to start their engines. Quickly you return to your roadster and, as you fire up its engine, you see the twin tail lights of the school bus shrinking in the dark as it heads towards the now-open freeway gate. The breakout has begun.</p>

<p>You are about to push open the door when you notice a thin, almost transparent cord wrapped around the inside handle. It rises to a shelf above the door, where it is attached to a large glass storage jar. Carefully you ease open the door a few inches, take hold of the cord between your fingers and snap it before entering the kitchen. Having deactivated this primitive trap, you make your way silently towards the bar at the front of the building.</p>
<p>As you enter, you search the darkened interior for some sign of Haskell, but you cannot see where he is. Rather than risk his mistaking you for a clansman, you whisper his name as you advance cautiously into the bar.</p>

<p>The clansmen dive aside as you crash through their barrier and accelerate across the open ground towards the safety of the southern ruins. But they recover quickly and soon the staccato hammering of their assault rifles is echoing in your wake. Bullets slam into the rear of the jeep and whistle past your head as you steer the vehicle towards the remains of a building with an open, unobstructed entrance. Bullets continue to ricochet off the bodywork until you skid to a halt inside the derelict building, where you abandon the jeep hurriedly.</p>

<p>The crack of your pistol shot is echoed by the clansman’s shocked scream. He drops the knife and clutches his hands to his wound before crashing lifelessly to the floor. With fear in their eyes, the other two reach for their pistols as they back away hastily from the guard’s bloodstained body.</p>

<p>Your killing blow tears open the sniper’s chest and flings him to the floor like a torn puppet. With a gurgling groan he rolls over onto his back and dies, his rifle still clutched in his hands. (If you wish to keep this weapon, you discover that it contains eight rounds of 7.62mm ammunition.)</p>
<p>You walk to the window and shout an ‘all clear’ to the others in the street below before you turn to leave.</p>

<p>Having chosen to stop here and rest, you pull off the highway and search among the ruins for a safe shelter. You are looking for a place where you will be able to hide the roadster and observe the road; if the Angelinos appear during the night, you will need as much forewarning of their arrival as possible in order to make a successful getaway.</p>
<p>Only one place meets your needs: a warehouse and factory complex near the middle of the town. The cracked and tarnished facia above its entrance tells you that this was once the Eldorado Woolen Mills. You park the roadster in a covered lot at the rear, and then settle yourselves on the first floor in a workshop that has an unobstructed view of the highway. You must now eat a Meal (or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), and take a Drink (or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>Kate curls up beside you and falls asleep in your arms, while you, heavy with fatigue, force yourself to stay awake and watch the highway. Your vigilance pays off when, two hours later, you see a line of lights in the double doors leading to the kitchen and you head straight for them.</p>

<p>This corridor services a number of offices and conference rooms before it ends at a wide staircase leading downwards. You descend three floors and discover the remains of a large private restaurant which, along with the kitchen, occupies most of the sub-basement level. A small ‘fire exit’ sign hangs over the double doors leading to the kitchen and you head straight for them.</p>
<p>As you are crossing the restaurant floor, your rumbling stomach reminds you that you have yet to eat anything today. Then the thought occurs to you that there could still be some canned food in the kitchen, and you decide to search it before you leave the building.</p>

<p>Kate grips your hand tightly as you descend with a group of the cave people into the depths of the Sonora caverns. An astounding speleological feast greets your eyes as you follow them through a series of monumental caves that have been eroded over millions of years by subterranean rivers and streams. The group stops frequently at specially prepared defensive hides, which are virtually impossible to see. One or two of their number, armed with rocks, spears, and slings, occupy each of these positions. At once you see that it is their intention to lure the clansmen into the caverns and fight them here, where, despite their lack of firearms, the odds are in their favour.</p>
<p>Soon the sound of gunfire begins to penetrate the caverns, announcing the arrival of the clansmen. You stop with Kate and crouch behind a clump of stalagmites, while the three remaining cave people arm themselves with rocks and take up a position on a ledge directly above a narrow defile. For several minutes the sound of gunfire and the screams of the wounded fill the caves with clamouring echoes. Then two of the Angelinos appear at the entrance to the defile and come running towards you. The cave people hurl their rocks and bring an Angelino crashing to the ground with a broken skull, but his partner avenges his death by sweeping them from the ledge with one long burst of automatic fire.</p>

<p>To your left is the open doorway of an empty locker room and you slip inside quickly to avoid being seen by the two guards. Having already removed the grenade from your pack, you set its variable timer to detonate four seconds after the pin is pulled. A quick glance into the corridor lets you know the guards’ position; you pull the pin and lob the grenade at them.</p>
<p>In the confines of the corridor the grenade explodes with devastating effect. Even though you are in an adjacent room, shielded from the direct blast, the concussion makes your ears ring and leaves you gasping for breath. You grab a towel that is hanging behind the door and use it to cover your mouth as you run down the smoke-filled corridor. The clansmen lie dead at the foot of the stairs. As you leap over their bodies and ascend the steps, you see the door to the observation block begin to open.</p>

<p>You chamber a round and take aim at the first clansman as he scurries between the rocks that litter the edge of the service area. He is less than thirty yards away when you squeeze off your first shot and bring him crashing to the ground. (Remember to deduct a round of 7.62mm ammunition from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.) His partner hesitates, and then abandons his stealthy approach and comes running towards you, screaming hysterically, his machine pistol blazing at his hip.</p>

<p>Kate rushes over to the dead man’s bike and salvages a machine pistol, while you return to the car and finish the repair. The sight of their leader dead leaves the remaining clansmen in a state of confusion, which lasts just long enough for you to complete your wheel change and jump back into the car with Kate.</p>
<p>As you reach the top of the bank and speed away towards the distant highway, you glance over your shoulder to see the Angelino scouts cradling their leader’s body on the bank of the South Concho River.</p>

<p>For three long, hot, tedious hours you sit watching the two clansmen (during which time you must take a Drink or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). You see them finish their meal and then attend to the repair of one of their motorcycle engines. You are beginning to fear that they have no intention of ever leaving the bridge, when another biker appears atop a ridge of high ground on the far side of the river. He approaches them and stops briefly to talk. Then the two clansmen mount their machines and follow him back across the bridge, accelerating away to the south.</p>
<p>Once you are sure that it is safe to continue, you start your engine and drive towards the bridge. As you approach the entrance you see the remains of the clansmen’s campfire, its ashes still smouldering.</p>

<p>You wait until Haskell has disappeared into an alley that runs alongside the bar; then you approach the front door cautiously and peek inside. Remnants of food lie scattered across the tables and, judging by the amount of fresh garbage strewn on the floor, a large group of clansmen were here not so long ago.</p>
<p>Suddenly you hear the sound of breaking glass. It comes from the rear of the building and you sense that Haskell must have something to do with it. Fearing that he is involved in a fight, you enter the bar and call out his name.</p>

<p>A hail of automatic rifle fire tears into the sides and rear of the jeep as you crash your way through the barrier and accelerate across the open ground. You are twenty yards from the safety of the southern ruins when two bullets penetrate the jeep’s gasolene tank.</p>
<p>The steel-jacketed rounds cause a spark that ignites the fuel, and, in one chilling instant, the vehicle is transformed into a blazing fireball. A kaleidoscope of shapes assails your eyes as the jeep somersaults end-over-end, before you are engulfed by a wave of searing white heat that kills you instantly.</p>

<p>From a position high among the tiers, you look down at the rows of empty seats that encircle the dusty arena and observe the preparations taking place around the perimeter track. This stadium once hosted international sporting events, many of which were televised and beamed live around the world. Now it plays host to a sporting event of a very different kind. The Angelinos have challenged the Lions to put forward four of their best riders for a twenty-lap motorcycle race around the arena. The track itself reminds you of an old film you saw when you were a child, a film about the wild chariot races that took place in ancient Rome. Today’s event is meant to be a friendly challenge to celebrate the signing of their alliance, but with clan honour at stake the race will undoubtedly be fought out in deadly earnest.</p>
<p>Facing you, on the far side of the stadium, is the glass-fronted observation block that was once used by television and radio commentators. Your curiosity is aroused by it when you notice that the door to the block is heavily guarded. Fixedly you stare at its full-length windows and count five occupants: four clansmen and one blonde-haired girl. You cannot see her face clearly, but you know that she is Kate Norton.</p>

<p>The bullets whine as they ricochet off the side of the Chevrolet and pass within inches of your body. You reach cover and Kate tosses her machine pistol to you over the side of the roadster. You catch it near the ground, but before you can draw back the firing bolt and return fire, you spot the outline of a man standing away to your right. He is armed with a pistol and he has you dead in his sights.</p>
<p>‘Do like the man said, buddy, or take your last breath,’ he says, and reluctantly you let the G-12 slip to the ground.</p>
<p>‘Ain’t no good you hidin’ in there, honey,’ says the voice from the pay booth. There is a pause, and then slowly Kate climbs out of the car and stands beside you.</p>
<p>The man with the pistol is tall and muscular and dressed in green army fatigues. His blond hair is cropped close to his head and his eyes are hidden behind a pair of dark sunglasses. With his pistol still aimed at your heart, he walks slowly towards you, stopping at the entrance to the pay booth. Two more men in uniform emerge from the doorway—the rifleman and one other who is armed with a sawn-off shotgun.</p>
<p>‘They don’t look like clan punks, Sarge,’ says the rifleman.</p>
<p>‘We’re not,’ interrupts Kate. ‘We’re running from the clans.’</p>
<p>Bemused, the blond-haired man scratches his chin and turns to say something quietly to his two companions. It is then that you notice the faded sergeant stripes and the circular globe-of-the-world emblem that adorn his sleeve. Instantly you recognize the latter: it is the emblem of the World Defence League. At length, he turns to face you once more and says, in a friendlier tone, ‘I think you two had better tell us your story.’</p>

<p>Mad Dog Michigan is poised to shoot you dead when suddenly a loud cheer fills the stadium. Ricky Riot, the top Angelinos rider, has just crossed the line and won the race, and it is this victory cry that distracts Mad Dog’s aim at the vital second. His shot goes awry, hitting the lifeless body of Mekong Mike, who is slumped at your feet. He fires again but this time the pistol jams. In desperation he hurls the weapon at your head. You dive to avoid it and it glances off your shoulder: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>When you get to your feet your enemy is speaking into a radio handset. In his hand he now holds another pistol and, with a cruel sneer, he raises it and takes deliberate aim at your head. He is about to squeeze the trigger when Kate appears behind him with a wooden stool clutched unsteadily in her hands. With one fell stroke she smashes it down upon his head and leaves him sprawled unconscious on the floor.</p>

<p>The clansman is no more than ten feet away when you spring up from your hiding place and bring your barrel to bear.

(Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.)</p>
<p>Kate moves forward to check that he is dead and to search his body. She keeps what she needs: his machine pistol, a quantity of ammunition, and his water canteen, and offers the rest of his possessions to you:</p>

<p>Your gunfire catches the fleeing clansman in the neck and lifts him clean out of the saddle. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.) In your rear-view mirror you see him bounce off the highway, roll over, and then disappear from view amongst a tangle of dead sagebrush at the side of the road. His bike continues in a straight line for almost a minute until, with a loud crash, it finally flips end-over-end and bursts into flames.</p>
<p>Less than a mile along the highway you happen upon a deserted stretch of Highway 87, running directly across your path. You join it, heading south, and within a few minutes you catch sight of a town on the road ahead.

<p>The convoy is travelling at break-neck speed as it passes through the blazing ruins of Allamoore and enters the pass beyond. Sweat trickles down your face as the ominous peak of Slaughter Mountain looms out of the smoke, and you witness the vicious battle taking place on its lower slopes. The bodies of slain Mavericks and Mexicans lie at the side of the freeway, tangled among the smoking remains of motorcycles and trucks once loaded with looted provisions. Small groups of desperate men are waging bitter hand-to-hand battles among this carnage, whilst others blaze away with automatic weapons, hiding in their foxholes dug by hand from the barren, stony soil.</p>
<p>The arrival of the convoy brings a lull in the fighting. Some turn their guns on you and a hail of bullets begins to rake either side of the colony vehicles. The tow truck approaches a bend in the freeway, and, as it turns, you see a Maverick kneeling at the side of the road with a missile launcher perched on his shoulder. He tracks the truck, but a burst of Mexican fire makes him dive for cover. When he appears again he no longer has the truck in his sights: he has you in his sights!</p>

<p>The clansman unsheathes his knife and slashes at your throat with a wide sweep of his tattooed arm. You duck beneath this vicious swipe, and before he can catch you with a backhanded slice, you drive your fist into his stomach.

<p>Concealed beneath the piles of old documents, you discover a padlocked hatch. Three well-placed kicks remove the lock and, when you lift the hinged trapdoor, you find a large, hermetically sealed storage bin, which is filled with cigarettes, packed neatly in cartons of 200.

<p>The deadly bullets miss you by inches and you dive to the floor in case the unseen gunman decides to fire again. Then you hear running footsteps approaching, and as they get louder, you raise your weapon and fire at the door. There is a scream from inside the kitchen, and you hear a body fall heavily to the tiled floor amid a crash of broken glass and crockery. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.)</p>
<p>Just inside the door you discover the body of a clansman. Judging from the long-horned skull that you find painted on the back of his leather vest, you have just laid to rest your first Angelino. On the floor nearby you find his weapons and equipment: a Machine Pistol (containing eighteen rounds of 9mm ammunition) and a Backpack, which holds the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible Saw</li>
<li>HE Grenade</li>
<li>Water Canteen (containing enough water for three Drinks)</li>

<p>The track leads to a cluster of log cabins and adobe huts that look as if they have only recently been constructed. Nearby, erected around the entrance to a cave, you see a palisade and, standing at the gate in this wall of logs, you notice a large group of men, women, and children. They are dressed in animal skins, and their faces and hair are dyed with bright colours. At your approach they scurry inside the gate and take cover behind their log wall.</p>
<p>The instant you bring your roadster to a halt you smell the strong, oily aroma of gasolene. With trepidation you inspect the bullet-riddled trunk and discover, to your horror, that gasolene is gushing from the spare fuel containers. They are so badly holed that an attempt at repairing them would be futile. The roar of your pursuer’s motorcycle is growing louder, and Kate urges you to abandon the car and take cover with the others behind the wall of logs. You nod your agreement and run towards the gate but as you get nearer, a man steps forward to block your access. He is holding a loaded bow. A flint-tipped arrow is drawn taut to his lips and he is pointing it at your chest.</p>

The speed of your reflexes saves you from being hit by the Maverick’s gunfire as, in the throes of death, he empties his pistol into the side of your car.</p>
<p>With the screams of the other clansmen ringing in your ears, you force yourself to concentrate on restarting your roadster. This time, despite an almost overwhelming urge to stamp the pedal straight through the floor, you take your foot off the gas as you turn the ignition switch. The move works—the engine roars back to life—and within seconds you are accelerating away from the Mavericks with your eyes glued firmly on the convoy’s tail lights, glowing red in the distance.

<p>You awake shortly after dawn, your neck stiff and aching after an uncomfortable night’s sleep. Little light is filtering from the surface of this underground lot, but there is sufficient for you to be able to take stock of your surroundings and make sure that you are alone. After checking your equipment, you leave your roadster and ascend to the surface, where you make a mental note of this location before beginning your trek towards the downtown stronghold of the Angelinos.</p>
<p>The heat is bearable at this early hour and you encounter no sign of the city’s occupants as stealthily you make your way through the shattered streets. An hour later you reach the southern section of their perimeter wall and stop to observe those who are guarding it. They look like a motley group of criminals armed with an assortment of weapons and equipment, much of which appears rusty and incapable of functioning. All that identifies them as Angelinos is the symbol they wear on their jackets and T-shirts: the skull of a long-horned steer.</p>
<p>After having studied the defences and watched the guards for the better part of an hour, you decide that the best place to gain entry to the stronghold is through an office block that interrupts the perimeter wall. The wooden planks that have been used to seal it are warped and split, and gaining entry to the building should not prove too difficult. Patiently you wait for the right moment before you break cover and sprint across the rubble-strewn street towards the main entrance.</p>

<p>You radio back to the convoy that you have sighted something suspicious in the hills to the south.

You point out the place on the ridge where you saw the reflections, and he scans the area with his powerful binoculars.</p>
<p>‘Whatever was up there has gone now, Cal,’ he says. ‘If it was clan scouts you saw then we’d better keep on movin’ before they rustle up enough of their kin to bushwhack us.’</p>
<p>You keep a watchful eye on the ridge as you lead the convoy along this section of the freeway. Anxiously you expect an ambush to take place at any time, but, despite your fears, an attack does not materialize. At length, the stores and houses of Van Horn appear on the road ahead. The town looks deserted but you decide to take no chances. You bring the convoy to a halt within a mile of the town limits and, accompanied by Sergeant Haskell, you leave your roadster and enter on foot to check that the place is safe for the convoy to pass through.</p>
<p>The tumbledown buildings are deathly quiet as you walk along the main street of Van Horn, and you notice nothing out of the ordinary until you reach a bar near the centre of the town. A motorcycle is parked beside the entrance, its fuel tank emblazoned with the ace-of-spades emblem of the Mavericks clan. You decide to search the bar and, if possible, try to capture and question the bike’s owner. Haskell suggests that it would be a good idea if one of you were to enter by the rear door and you nod your agreement.</p>

Horrified, he fumbles to reload his weapon, but before he can do so, he is hit by the rear of your car and sent tumbling over the side of the bridge.</p>

They warn that Fabens is a Mexican base, and that they have barricaded the east freeway approach to that town. In closing, they tell you to contact them again if you make it through Fabens.

He is within a few inches of the top when it suddenly caves in beneath his front wheel and he is flung head-first over the handlebars. With a scream of terror he cartwheels through the air and lands heavily on his back at the edge of the freeway. Winded by the fall, he cannot summon enough strength to roll away as his bike comes crashing down upon him.</p>
<p>Certain in the knowledge that he could not possibly have survived such a terrible crash, you return to the highway and begin the next stage of your journey to San Angelo.

<p>After your meal you try to think where you might find some gasolene. Sergeant Haskell and his men—Marines Gunter and Knott—have searched every square inch of Fort Stockton and know that there is none to be had here.</p>
<p>‘What we need is an old road map,’ says Haskell. ‘One that would show us where the freeway rest stops and gas stations in this area were located.’</p>
<p>‘I’ve got a map,’ you volunteer, and take from your jacket the map that you snatched from Mad Dog Michigan’s table at the stadium in San Angelo.</p>
<p>‘Hey, where did you get this?’ says Haskell, as he examines the notes and other markings that have been made on the map of the United States. You tell him its origins and he scrutinizes it at length. Finally, he comments, ‘What you’ve got here is a blueprint of a major HAVOC operation to take over the country. This is one hot piece of property: it shows clan strengths, supply areas, HAVOC strongholds, controlled cities, everything—even pockets of WDL resistance on the eastern seaboard. We’ve gotta get this to El Paso. If there’s anything left of WDL headquarters then they must be warned about what is happening in the East.’</p>
<p>‘OK,’ you reply, uneasily, ‘but what about fuel? My roadster has barely enough to make it another twenty miles. All we need is enough gas to get as far as Kent in time for the rendezvous with the colony. Then we can refuel from the tanker and you can catch a ride with us all the way to Fort Bliss.’</p>
<p>‘There’s a rest stop here,’ replies Haskell, pointing to the map at a place on Interstate 10 that is halfway between Fort Stockton and a town called Brogado. ‘There’s no knowing if there’s still any gas in its storage tanks but it’s our only hope. It looks like a 25-mile-drive—do you think you can make it?’</p>

The enemy are slow to react to your getaway and you are more than ten miles from the town before you see their headlights in your driving mirror. Your speedy escape may have wrong-footed them, but they have caught up quickly. Fearing that you will not be able to outrun them, you leave the highway and hide your roadster behind a rocky ridge that runs parallel to the road.

Shortly the truck stops once again, but this time you notice that it has drawn up alongside three others in a section of the stadium that has been turned into a pits area. You slip away from the truck before the driver disembarks, and make your way through the crowds of clan mechanics and riders towards an empty section of the arena.</p>
<p>From a position high among the tiers, you look down at the rows of empty seats that encircle the dusty arena and observe the preparations taking place around the perimeter track. This stadium once hosted international sporting events, many of which were televised and beamed live around the world. Now it plays host to a sporting event of a very different kind. The Angelinos have challenged the Lions to put forward four of their best riders for a twenty-lap motorcycle race around the arena. The track itself reminds you of an old film you saw when you were a child, a film about the wild chariot races that took place in ancient Rome. Today’s event is meant to be a friendly challenge to celebrate the signing of their alliance, but with clan honour at stake the race will undoubtedly be fought out in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>At your killing blow, your adversary drops in a limp and lifeless heap at your feet. Meanwhile, his confederate has run back to his motorcycle and armed himself with a machine pistol. You dive aside just in time to avoid his first burst of fire, and, as you scurry for cover, you retrieve the pistol that you had kicked from his dead partner’s hand.</p>
<p>With a vengeful scream, the clansman comes running at you, firing his machine pistol from the hip. Bullets tear up the ground where you lie, forcing you to stand up and meet this madman head on.

<p>You return to your roadster and keep a watchful eye on the ridge as you wait for the convoy to close up the gap. Then, when the vehicles are once again visible in your driving mirror, you continue along the freeway. Anxiously you expect an ambush to take place at any time, but, in spite of your fears, an attack does not materialize.</p>
<p>At length you see the stores and houses of Van Horn appear on the road ahead. The town looks deserted but you decide to take no chances. You bring the convoy to a halt within a mile of the town limits and, accompanied by Sergeant Haskell, you leave your roadster and enter on foot to check that it is safe for the convoy to pass through.</p>
<p>The tumbledown buildings are deathly quiet as you walk along the main street of Van Horn, and you notice nothing out of the ordinary until you reach a bar near the centre of the town. A motorcycle is parked beside the entrance, its fuel tank emblazoned with the ace-of-spades emblem of the Mavericks clan.

You turn off your torch and watch from the cover of the rocks as they pass along the highway heading south. Then, once they have disappeared, you resume the daunting task of repairing the crash damage.</p>

He finishes speaking into a radio handset and then, with a cruel sneer, levels his pistol, taking deliberate aim at your head.

<p>News of your escape into the southern ruins of San Angelo is relayed to Mad Dog Michigan. Already he has told the Angelinos that you have assassinated their leader and, in the prevailing emergency, he has appointed himself their new commander. He orders the Angelinos to saturate the southern sector and to kill both of you on sight.</p>
<p>You manage to reach the megamarket without further clan encounters, and are relieved to find that your roadster has remained undisturbed since you left it this morning. It takes a few frustrating minutes to start the engine, but as soon as it is running smoothly you leave San Angelo as fast as you can, heading south on the remains of Highway 277.</p>

The blast takes your breath away, but you recover quickly and bring your car under control with consummate skill. In your mirror you see the convoy coming under small-arms fire, but it is light and sporadic and it claims no victims. Soon you are all safely out of the battle zone and racing away from the Slaughter Mountain run towards Sierra Blanca.</p>

For fifteen minutes you walk without interruption until you reach a wider section where a ladder ascends to a circular steel hatch fitted flush to the tunnel ceiling. Kate suggests that it could be worth investigating, and you lift up the heavy steel cover carefully and look out. Kate was right: the sight that greets you is the entrance gate to the Reagan Memorial Stadium.</p>

<p>Kate catches you as you emerge from the library and pulls you a safe distance away. Moments later, the roof of the library collapses with a loud, splintering <i>crack</i>, and clouds of sparks whirl into the night, carried upward by the strong, gusting wind. Silently you look at Kate’s smoke-blackened face, and then at the blazing library, and you realize just how lucky you both are to have got out of that inferno alive.</p>
<p>By the time you recover fully from your ordeal and return to your roadster, the storm has blown itself out. The eastern sky is lightening as dawn approaches, and you decide to leave Bakersfield now, before the sun rises and the temperature becomes unbearable. Beyond the town, the freeway climbs steadily towards a distant line of mountains that shimmer on the horizon. You keep your speed as low as possible and cover forty miles with your fuel gauge nudging the zero mark.

<p>A formidable barricade has been thrown across the freeway approach. It consists of auto wrecks filled with earth and broken chunks of concrete, stacked three deep. It would be virtually impossible for the convoy to break through this barrier. On the perimeter of the town, the Mexicans have dug pits to entrap any vehicles attempting to bypass the barricade. It looks hopeless, but if you are to reach El Paso, you must find a way through this freeway defence.</p>
<p>After observing the barricade at some length, Sergeant Haskell evolves a plan to blow a hole in it that is large enough to allow the convoy through in its entirety. You return to Fort Hancock and inform the colony of the plan. Then a message is sent to El Paso, requesting that they be ready and waiting to receive you once you break through.</p>

Kate looks over her shoulder and begins to slow her pace to allow you to catch up, but you scream at her to keep running and she obeys your command.</p>
<p>When you are halfway across the gap, a wave of exhaustion descends on you like a lead blanket. Painfully your thigh muscles tighten until, in the throes of cramp, you stumble and fall. Desperately you try to rise but more shots ring out and you feel something sharp and searing, like a red-hot dagger, pierce your side.

<p>You try to ignore the hail of bullets whistling past on all sides as coolly you crouch down and adopt a two-handed combat stance in order to steady your aim. The clansman is wild with fury, but a single shot to the head, delivered with chilling precision, is all it takes to stop him dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>Before you bury these two Detroit Lions, you search their bodies and their bikes, and discover the following useful items:</p>

<p>The coyote is in a frenzy of pain and fear. No matter how hard Kate strikes it with her pistol, the beast refuses to relinquish its grip on your arm. In desperation she tries to drag the dog away, but this also pulls your arm off the steering wheel and causes the car to swerve sideways and go into a violent skid. You slam on the brakes and bring the roadster to a juddering halt, throwing the coyote hard against the dashboard, but still it remains fixed to your arm. The only way you are going to free yourself of this creature is by killing it in close combat.</p>

<p>The frightened man lowers his aim and sends the arrow thudding into the ground at your feet—a warning shot. At that moment your pursuer comes roaring up the track, closely followed by the other Angelino scouts whom you encountered at the bridge. You scream a warning to Kate and throw yourself down as a double burst of machine gun fire strafes the palisade. The bullets pass over your back and hit the archer in the chest, dropping him in a tangled heap on the threshold of the gateway.</p>
<p>You spring to your feet and rush forward to help Kate drag his body away, so that the gate can be closed. The other members of the settlement come to your aid and, once the gate is secure, they point to the cave mouth and urge you to enter. You do not want to abandon your roadster to the Angelinos, but to stay here and attempt to fight would be suicidal. Reluctantly you leave the gate and follow them into the cave.</p>

It looks like the safest route to follow and it is soon agreed.</p>

<p>You decide to spend the night in the library’s main hall. After clearing a space near the centre, you build a small campfire, using a few of the many thousands of books that line the walls. Then, once it is ablaze, you help Kate to prepare the food she has found. Outside, the weather has grown steadily worse. Thunder rolls across the surrounding plains and the jagged flashes of forked lightning illuminate the roiling clouds of dust with increasing regularity.</p>
<p>‘I don’t like it—it looks real bad,’ you say, as you stare anxiously out of the window at the raging storm.</p>
<p>‘It ain’t all bad,’ replies Kate. ‘At least we don’t have to worry ’bout Mad Dog’s boys showin’ up outta the blue.’</p>
<p>The food and wine taste delicious (restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), and, after eating your fill, you both settle down to sleep in front of the glowing embers of the campfire.</p>
<p>It seems as though you have only just closed your eyes when you are stirred to consciousness by a loud crackling sound and the acrid smell of smoke. Horror fills your senses when you open your eyes to see yourself surrounded by a blazing wall of yellow flame. Lightning struck the library roof while you were asleep, starting a fire that has been fuelled by the shelves of dust-dry books, and which has now spread to the main hall where it threatens to consume you both.</p>
<p>Quickly you wake Kate and together you fight your way towards the main door. You are within ten feet of the exit when a burning bookcase falls across your path.</p>

<p>You pass between the shattered stores and houses of Broome with your nerves on edge, half-expecting to run into a clan patrol or fall prey to an ambush. Yet your visit passes without incident and soon you find yourself back on the open highway, heading southeast to San Angelo. You are hungry, and during your drive you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>When you first see San Angelo, the sun is a quarter hidden below the skyline, its soft red glow reflecting upon a cluster of tall buildings that stand at the city’s centre. They are the ravaged shells of banks and state offices that were the pride of this once-prosperous city before ‘The Day’. Surrounding them, for many miles, is a sea of dust and rubble. Your skin prickles when you realize that this is all that remains of the city’s suburbs, an area that once was home to more than a million Texans.</p>

It would be near-suicidal to approach any closer, so you make a wide detour around the city limits and try an approach from the south.</p>
<p>It takes nearly two hours to reach the south side of San Angelo, by which time night has fallen. Fortunately, your decision to go south has paid off: this section of the city is virtually uninhabited by the Angelinos and your approach goes undetected.</p>
<p>Hidden by the darkness, you are able to get within a mile of the downtown area before you encounter any sign of clan activity. You know that if your rescue of Kate is to be successful you must not allow your roadster to fall into enemy hands, and with this thought in mind, you search for somewhere safe to leave it while you venture into the downtown area on foot.</p>
<p>An underground parking lot situated below the looted ruins of a Sears megamarket provides just such a safe haven, and it is here that you hide your car. You are tired after the rigours of your journey, so you decide to get a few hours’ sleep and attempt your rescue at first light.</p>

The clansmen seem to have exhausted their supply of grenades, but they are all armed with machine pistols and they proceed to empty them in your direction.</p>
<p>Kate draws her pistol and prepares to give covering fire while you inspect the damage. The front left tyre has been shredded by shrapnel and is beyond repair.

Also, Pop Ewell has monitored by radio the movements of a large Mexican clan, who have crossed the border in search of fuel and food. And, to make matters even worse, Mad Dog Michigan has linked up with the ‘Saints’, the clan from New Orleans, and now they too are somewhere in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The clansman’s eyes widen with a mixture of awe and avarice when you produce the bottle of bourbon from your Backpack. Greedily he snatches it from your hands, pulls the cork, and up-ends the bottle into his mouth. Five gulps later he replaces the cork and grins delightedly.</p>
<p>‘You jus’ bought yourself a grandstand seat, fella,’ he says, hiding the bottle inside his jacket.</p>
<p>Still grinning, he returns to the cab and restarts the engine. Shortly the truck stops once again, but this time it is parked alongside three others in a section of the stadium that has been turned into a pits area. You leave the truck and slip away through the crowds of mechanics and riders towards an empty section of the arena.</p>
<p>From a position high among the tiers, you look down at the rows of empty seats that encircle the dusty arena and observe the preparations taking place around the perimeter track. This stadium once hosted international sporting events, many of which were televised and beamed live around the world. Now it plays host to a sporting event of a very different kind. The Angelinos have challenged the Lions to put forward four of their best riders for a twenty-lap motorcycle race around the arena. The track itself reminds you of an old film you saw when you were a child, a film about the wild chariot races that took place in ancient Rome. Today’s event is meant to be a friendly challenge to celebrate the signing of their alliance, but with clan honour at stake the race will undoubtedly be fought out in deadly earnest.</p>
<p>Facing you, on the far side of the stadium, is the glass-fronted observation block that was once used by television and radio commentators. Your curiosity is aroused by it when you notice that the door to the block is heavily guarded.

<p>For seventeen miles you follow the 137 south. The surface of the highway is so poor that were it not for the line of shattered telegraph poles that run parallel to the road, you would find it impossible to tell the difference between the highway and the open ground. It takes you an hour to reach a junction where the remains of another highway, the 158, cuts east/west across your path. Its condition is marginally better and, for the first time since you left Stanton, you are able to increase your speed to thirty miles per hour as you head east towards Sterling City. From there you will make your way along Highway 87 to San Angelo.</p>
<p>It is nearly noon when you see a ramshackle town appear out of the heat haze that dances on the road ahead. Now the temperature is well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and, as you drive along its deserted main street, you think about stopping to rest for a while in the shade.</p>

<p>When you emerge from the caverns you are astounded to see that the Angelinos have been completely overwhelmed by this colony of cave dwellers. The few clansmen to have survived the ambush have been trussed up like turkeys and are being guarded by a circle of spear-wielding women. The rest of the colony is so busy stripping and searching the bodies of those they have killed that they fail to notice you and Kate, as you leave the entrance quietly and make your way back to the roadster. You admire their bravery but there is something about these people, something about their appearance and their silence, that unsettles you.</p>
<p>You inspect the damage to the trunk. Your fears are confirmed: you no longer have sufficient fuel to reach Kent. You siphon the tanks of the clansmen’s bikes, and save what you can from the bottom of the two perforated fuel canisters, but you estimate that in total you have only enough to take you 120 miles.</p>
<p>As you are leaving, you notice that the cave people are preparing a funeral pyre for those who were killed in the fighting. It strikes you as a very sensible and civilized way to dispose of the dead, and makes you think that perhaps your suspicions about these people were groundless after all. Your illusions about the cave people are soon shattered, however, when Kate points out that they are not burning the dead at all: they are cooking them.</p>

<p>She points back along the highway at another dust cloud, which is fast approaching. You do not need a magnifying device to be able to tell that the dust is being stirred up by a pack of bikers that have come racing out of San Angelo.</p>
<p>‘I think it’s time we were movin’ on,’ says Kate, uneasily.</p>

You search the cloudless expanse and your hopes soar as you see Rickenbacker’s motorized hang glider circling above the town. He comes down and makes a low pass, waving his arms excitedly as he flies directly over the roadster. Then he is gone, rising above the surrounding peaks and returning the way he came.</p>

More than half an hour later you emerge into a wider section where a faint light seeps down from glass bricks embedded in the ceiling around a circular steel hatch. A ladder ascends to the hatch and Kate suggests that this one could be worth investigating. You agree, and when you lift up the heavy steel cover carefully and look out, she is proved right: the sight that greets you is the entrance gate to the Reagan Memorial Stadium.</p>

Ahead, a derelict pump house appears, straddling the ditch, its angular roof offering itself as a ramp that could be used to launch a jump onto the freeway. The clansman takes one last look at you over his shoulder and then, with a scream of fearful exhilaration, he winds back the throttle and points his bike at the pump house roof.</p>

<p>Six black-clad bikers are riding along Interstate 10 towards the rest stop. Affixed to the rear of their saddles are long, whiplash aerials, which are topped with black pennons that bear a lion’s-head symbol. You stare at these small black flags and a tingle runs down your spine: it is the emblem of the Detroit Lions clan.</p>
<p>The bikers catch sight of your roadster and bring their machines to a halt a hundred yards from the rest stop. Then all six spread out and, using the rocks and boulders that litter the landscape, they make their way forward slowly. Sergeant Haskell orders Gunter and Knott to take cover and open fire at the advancing clansmen; they must not be allowed to capture or destroy the fuel tank.</p>

<p>On the other side of the hatch you discover an electrical cable duct that is just large enough to accommodate both of you in some discomfort. You enter first, and then Kate squeezes in, closing the hatch behind her. It is now pitch black and very claustrophobic. Outside you can hear the angry screams and pounding feet of the clansmen as determinedly they try to track you down. The news of Mekong Mike’s death has been broken to the Angelinos and you have heard more than one of them vow that they will kill you when they find you. The only escape route open to you now is to descend the rusty rungs of the iron service ladder on which you stand.</p>

<p>Beyond Sterling City the highway follows a wide, dust-filled gully that was once the North Concho River.

<p>‘What exactly you offerin’ in return for a free ride and a ringside seat, eh?’ replies the clansman.</p>
<p>Slowly you unshoulder your Backpack and flip open the buckles. ‘Choose,’ you say, inviting him to look at the items you are carrying. Roughly he pulls the pack from your hands and tips the contents onto the floor of the truck.</p>
<p>‘I’ll take these two,’ he says. ‘You can keep the rest o’ the junk.’</p>
<p>Erase from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> those items which you have noted in the second and third sections of your Backpack Items list. These are the items chosen by the clansman in return for free passage into the stadium. If you possess less than two Backpack Items, you must erase either two Medi-kit units or one close combat weapon instead.</p>
<p>With a smile on his face, the clansman pockets your bribe and returns to the cab. He restarts the truck but shortly it stops once again. He has drawn up alongside three other trucks in a section of the stadium that has been turned into a pits area. You leave the truck and slip away through the crowds of clan mechanics and riders towards an empty section of the enclosure.</p>
<p>From a position high among the tiers, you look down at the rows of empty seats that encircle the dusty arena and observe the preparations taking place around the perimeter track. This stadium once hosted international sporting events, many of which were televised and beamed live around the world. Now it plays host to a sporting event of a very different kind. The Angelinos have challenged the Lions to put forward four of their best riders for a twenty-lap motorcycle race around the arena. The track itself reminds you of an old film that you saw when you were a child, a film about the wild chariot races that took place in ancient Rome. Today’s event is meant to be a friendly challenge to celebrate the signing of their alliance, but with clan honour at stake the race will undoubtedly be fought out in deadly earnest.</p>
<p>Facing you, on the far side of the stadium, is the glass-fronted observation block that was once used by television and radio commentators. Your curiosity is aroused by it when you notice that the door to the block is heavily guarded. Fixedly you stare at its full-length windows and count five occupants: four clansmen and one blonde-haired girl. You cannot see her face clearly, but you know that she is Kate Norton.</p>

<p>With your pulse racing, you focus on the approaching bikers. They ride machines bedecked with a strange symbol: a priest or some other holy man, dressed in flowing white robes, with a halo above his head. It looks a curiously pious symbol for a clan to adopt, until you remember that before ‘The Day’, the name of the professional football team based in New Orleans was the ‘Saints’. Suddenly you realize that this pack of riders, some 400–500 strong, are the New Orleans clan that Mad Dog Michigan sent for. It would be disastrous for the convoy to run head-on into a group of this size, and you hurry back to the colony as quickly as you can to break the bad news.</p>
<p>With the New Orleans clan approaching from the north, a large Mexican clan crossing the border to the south, and the threat of a Maverick ambush to the west, the prospects of reaching El Paso unscathed now look decidedly unpromising. With no time to discuss the situation at length, the convoy reverts to the original plan: to stay on Interstate 10 and approach El Paso from the east. It is the shortest, most direct route, even though there is a very real chance of falling prey to a Maverick ambush.</p>

<p>Frantically you spin the wheel to the left and brace yourself as the roadster slews sideways across the wreckage-strewn highway. Before it comes to a halt, there is a sudden and violent jolt that sets the car spinning like a top in the opposite direction. The panel truck has clipped the rear fender and the force of the impact leaves you dazed and gasping for breath: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>The sight of the convoy fast disappearing along the freeway is all that is needed to bring you rapidly to your senses. You turn the wheel and pump the gas pedal, but the engine has stalled and the car does not respond. Instantly, you reach for the ignition to bring the car back to life before the Mavericks close in and put an end to yours.</p>

<p>You keep a watchful eye on the ridge as you wait for the convoy to close the gap. Then, when the vehicles are once again visible in your driving mirror, you continue along the freeway. Anxiously, you expect an ambush to take place at any time, but, despite your fears, it does not materialize.</p>
<p>At length the stores and houses of Van Horn appear on the road ahead. The town looks deserted but you decide to take no chances. You bring the convoy to a halt within a mile of the town limits and, accompanied by Sergeant Haskell, you leave your roadster and enter on foot to check that it is safe for the convoy to pass through.</p>
<p>The tumbledown buildings are deathly quiet as you walk along the main street of Van Horn, and you notice nothing out of the ordinary until you reach a bar near the centre of the town. A motorcycle is parked beside the entrance, its fuel tank emblazoned with the ace-of-spades emblem of the Mavericks clan. You decide to search the bar and, if possible, try to capture and question the bike’s owner. Haskell suggests that it would be a good idea if one of you were to enter by the rear door and you nod your agreement.</p>

<p>Expectantly you keep an eye on your rear-view mirror as you power your roadster along the rock-strewn asphalt of Highway 277. You are convinced that the Angelinos will soon be on your tail, yet you have covered fifteen miles and still there is nothing to indicate that you are being pursued. You are beginning to relax when Kate points to a small town in the distance. It is built around a bridge that crosses a stream of shallow black water that was once known as the South Concho River. Near the middle of this town, on the highway approach to the bridge, is a rising cloud of dust.</p>

She opens fire at the clansman, but he returns fire and one of his bullets smashes the barrel of Kate’s gun, rendering it useless. In the next instant he leaps onto the rack but, before he brings his weapon to bear, you lash out and smash his knee with the edge of your hand. He drops his gun and falls forward, landing on top of you with a jolt that leaves you breathless.</p>

<p>The corridor turns left and, after a short distance, left again, and you find yourself faced by a door that is different to all the others.

<p>As night draws in and the temperature falls, a strong wind arises that whips along the freeway, howling like an angry ghost. You sense that it is the prelude to a storm and you suggest to Kate that you look for somewhere to shelter.

The moment the clansman sees you rest the barrel on the door, he veers across to the left lane of the highway as quickly as he can. You smile as you realize the purpose of this manoeuvre: he is trying to increase his chances of survival by making it as difficult as he can for you to shoot at him with your right hand.</p>
<p>Keeping the roadster in a straight line—and the sheer force of the rushing wind whipping around the end of the rifle’s barrel—make it impossible for you to take aim.

They bring their machines to a halt in the middle of the town and begin a search of the surrounding ruins. ‘They mustn’t find us,’ you whisper, as you look around the workshop for somewhere to hide. ‘If they do we’re as good as dead.’</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps echoes through the building as you help Kate to conceal herself in an old stationery cupboard. Once she is well hidden, you slip inside an adjoining storage room that is filled from floor to ceiling with musty mohair blankets. Minutes later, you hear a clansman walk into the workshop.

<p>The time Sergeant Haskell used to observe the barricade was well spent. He noticed that the Mexican clansmen have positioned an anti-tank weapon behind it, which doubtless they will bring into action if it is needed. Littered around it are several dozen boxes of shells. If one of those boxes were to explode, it would set off the others and destroy most of the central section of the barricade. Haskell has an incendiary grenade which would do the job, but in order to make sure that it landed in the correct place—in one of the boxes of ammunition—one of you would have to go to the barricade and place it there.

You invert the handset of your CB and key in the frequency that Pop Ewell monitors aboard the school bus. But, for some unknown reason, the frequency is saturated with static and you are unable to transmit. You search for a clear channel and, by chance, you lock on to part of a two-way conversation:</p>

He says that he is a Maverick outrider, a scout, one of a large group sent here to ambush the Big Spring colony. While drunk, he fell off his bike and broke his leg. Unable to ride, his fellow scouts left him here with the promise that he would be collected when they returned. His group are fighting a Mexican clan near Sierra Blanca.

<p>Your gunfire hits the Maverick in the midriff, forcing him to his knees. His first shot misses you, and through clenched teeth he spits out a curse as he struggles to raise his pistol for a second attempt. He is on the brink of death, and rather than waste precious ammunition, you choose not to fire again. It proves to be a fatal mistake.</p>
<p>His pistol is not a standard factory model; it is a weapon that has been customized to fire in fully-automatic mode. With his last ounce of strength he thumbs the selector to auto, and, as he falls forward, he empties the fourteen-round magazine in your direction. Sharp, stinging cores of pain erupt in a line across your chest as the 9mm bullets find their mark. The pain is unbearable, and seems to fill your entire body, but it soon gives way to a numbness that robs you of all sensation.

A second shot rings out and you pinpoint the sniper’s location just a moment before a stinging sensation assails your eyes. The bullet has hit the road surface a few inches in front of your face, and a handful of grit has been kicked up into your eyes: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Angered by this deliberate attempt to kill you, and by the heart-rending moans of the wounded Marine Gunter, you decide to flush this sniper out and even the score. Kate and the others are pinned down on the other side of the street and cannot move without exposing themselves to the sniper’s sights. Only you can reach the drug store entrance with some degree of cover.</p>
<p>When a third shot hits the helpless Gunter, your anger gives way to a grim determination. Despite Kate’s pleas to stay down, you spring to your feet and sprint towards the drug store entrance.</p>

<p>You shoot less than a second before the Maverick discharges his pistol, yet your aim is deadly accurate. You deal him a fatal wound to the head that spins him sideways with the force of its impact. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Unfortunately, the pistol in his hand is not a standard factory model: it is a weapon he has customized to fire in fully-automatic mode. The selector is set to auto and, as he falls to the ground, he squeezes the trigger and empties the fourteen-round magazine in a line across your car.</p>
<p>A sharp, stinging core of pain erupts in your left arm as one of the 9mm bullets finds its mark: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. With determination, you force yourself to ignore the agonizing pain and concentrate instead on escaping from the clutches of the other Maverick clansmen. Again, you attempt to start the car, but this time you take your foot off the gas as you turn the ignition switch, despite an almost overwhelming urge to stamp the pedal straight through the floor. The move works—the engine roars back to life—and within seconds you are accelerating away from the barricade, your eyes glued firmly to the convoy’s tail lights. A few poorly aimed bullets chase your escape but you soon catch up with the school bus and pass beyond range of the Mavericks’ guns.</p>

<p>You freeze, your stomach pinched tight with fear as you try to ignore the crawling sensation that is now moving rapidly up the sleeve of your jacket. Outside, you hear the clansman leaving the workshop and, as soon as you are sure he has gone, you push open the door and step out of the store room.</p>
<p>By now the tickling sensation has reached your bicep. When Kate emerges from her hiding place, you tell her what is wrong and ask her to remove your jacket carefully. Gently she lifts it off your shoulders and gasps when she sees the spider that is perched on your arm.</p>

<p>It comes as a relief to discover that the town of Sierra Blanca is deserted. Here the convoy halts to assess the damage and treat those who were wounded during the run. Cutter is among those who need treatment, having stopped a bullet in his left forearm. However, although you can tell he is in considerable pain, he does his best to hide it.</p>
<p>Kate greets you with a kiss that leaves you in no doubt about how pleased she is to see you alive and in one piece. Together you go to the school bus for some food and water (restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), and while you are there, you listen to Pop Ewell as he tries to make radio contact with the WDL unit in El Paso. After several attempts, he manages to raise them, but they refuse to acknowledge his call unless he gives a WDL security call sign, a sort of radio password that will prove he is not a clansman trying to trick his way into the city stronghold.</p>

<p>You manage to pull yourself over the wall and gain access to the stadium without being seen. From a position high among the tiers, you look down at the rows of empty seats that encircle the dusty arena and observe the preparations taking place around the perimeter track. This stadium once hosted international sporting events, many of which were televised and beamed live around the world. Now it plays host to a sporting event of a very different kind. The Angelinos have challenged the Lions to put forward four of their best riders for a twenty-lap motorcycle race around the arena. The track itself reminds you of an old film you saw when you were a child, a film about the wild chariot races that took place in ancient Rome. Today’s event is meant to be a friendly challenge to celebrate the signing of their alliance, but with clan honour at stake the race will undoubtedly be run in deadly earnest.</p>
<p>Facing you, on the far side of the stadium, is the glass-fronted observation block that was once used by television and radio commentators. Your curiosity is aroused when you notice that the door to the block is heavily guarded. Fixedly you stare at its full-length windows and count five occupants: four clansmen and one blonde-haired girl. You cannot see her face clearly, but you have a strong feeling that the girl is Kate Norton.</p>

<p>You grab Kate by the wrist and take cover among the rocks that border the highway, but it is already too late. You have been seen by the approaching Angelinos and, as they get nearer, they fan out and encircle your position. Their newly-elected leader, a wiry biker with a badly broken nose, offers you the chance to give yourselves up. Defiantly you both refuse.</p>
<p>Their first attempt to capture you leaves five of them dead. Rather than risk losing any more of his men, the leader orders grenades to be thrown. They explode with a thunderous flash and you are both mortally wounded in the blast. Then they spray your position with automatic fire. When the Angelinos finally summon enough courage to close in, they find the two of you lying dead in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>You feel a jolt against your shoulder as one of the clansmen stubs his toe against the raised edge of the cover and is sent sprawling to the ground. Quickly you try to replace the hatch but it is roughly pulled aside by the angry Angelino. The instant he sees your face, he draws his pistol and empties it into the shaft. Pain erupts in your head and chest as seven heavy .45-calibre slugs knock you off the ladder. The last thing you hear, as you plummet into the darkness, is Kate’s echoing scream of horror.</p>

<p>You signal to Kate to come over to your position and immediately she obeys. You point to the two circling clansmen and she nods her silent understanding of the situation. Together you abandon your cover and shadow the two men as they circle around to the rear. An old tyre rack propped against the side of a derelict car wash offers you a good defensive position, and quickly you scurry towards it. Kate reaches the rack first, in time to see the Lions halt. For a moment they duck out of sight, but soon they reappear and come running, half-crouched, with guns at the ready, towards your newfound hiding place.</p>
<p>Kate cocks her machine pistol and takes aim as the first clansman scurries between the rocks that litter the edge of the service area. He is less than twenty yards away when she squeezes off a burst of fire, bringing him crashing to the ground. His partner hesitates, and then abandons his stealthy approach and comes running towards you, screaming hysterically, his own machine pistol blazing furiously at his hip. Bullets rip into the tyre rack and one smashes the barrel of Kate’s gun, rendering it useless. In the next instant, he leaps onto the rack but, before he brings his weapon to bear, you lash out and smash his knee with the edge of your hand. He drops his weapon and falls forward, landing on top of you with a jolt that leaves you breathless.</p>

<p>You raise your head and take aim at the bridge, but before you squeeze the trigger you notice that the clansman is no longer there: he has changed his position. He is now lying flat on his stomach behind the rear wheel of his motorcycle. Swiftly you swing around and open fire at the bike. Your gunfire rips into the rear tyre and catches the clansman full in the face, killing him instantly. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.)</p>
<p>Before you bury them you search both bodies and the bikes, and discover the following useful items:</p>

<p>Drawing on your reserves of nervous energy, you race up the last few steps and lash out at the door with the sole of your boot. The door flies wide open and slams against the wall, sending the red-headed clansman who was about to investigate the noise sprawling flat on his back.</p>
<p>Inside the observation room you see two men—one dressed in a flamboyant mix of bright colours and the other attired in sombre black—seated at a table with a map of the United States spread before them. A muscular clansman, his chest criss-crossed with cartridge belts, stands behind the man in black and beyond him, huddled in the corner of the room, is Kate. Clearly she has suffered at the hands of Mad Dog Michigan and the sight of her bruised face and her pained, despairing expression stirs you to a fit of rage.</p>

<p>Your escape from the building goes unnoticed by the few clan patrols that are operating in the area. Mekong Mike has brought most of his men up to the central and northern sectors, partly as a show of strength to Mad Dog Michigan and partly as a precaution in case Mad Dog’s talk of an alliance turns out to be a bluff, and he is really here to try to take over the city.</p>
<p>The further you venture north, the more clan activity you find, and you are forced to stay hidden for longer periods as you snake your way through the ruins towards the centre of the stronghold. You are working on the assumption that Kate is with Mad Dog Michigan, and he is likely to be found where the number of clansmen is greatest.</p>
<p>It is shortly before noon when you catch sight of a building that dominates the centre of San Angelo—the Reagan Memorial Stadium. Scores of motorcycles and their riders are gathered around its entrance where two large, tattered banners are fluttering symbolically in the breeze. One bears the lion’s-head mark of the Detroit Lions clan; the other is emblazoned with the long-horned-steer skull symbol of the Angelinos clan. From your location opposite the entrance you overhear two Angelinos talking. You learn that some sort of motorcycle race is to take place here this afternoon, to celebrate the signing of a pact between the two clans. Now you feel sure that Mad Dog and Kate are here somewhere inside the stadium, and you apply yourself to finding a way in.</p>
<p>After watching the entrance for over an hour, only two options appear open to you. You can try to hide in one of the trucks that are carrying spares for the clansmen’s bikes, in the hope that they will enter the stadium before the race; or you can attempt to scale the stadium wall at one of the many places where it has partially collapsed.</p>

Then a string of bullets ricochets off the rubble-strewn ground around your feet, kicking up a cloud of dust that engulfs your whole body. Kate looks over her shoulder with fear stark in her eyes, but when you scream that you are OK, and tell her to keep running at all costs, her expression relaxes and she obeys your command willingly.

<p>When you first see San Angelo, the sun is a quarter hidden below the skyline, its soft red glow reflecting upon a cluster of tall buildings that stand at the city’s centre. They are the ravaged shells of banks and state offices that were the pride of this once-prosperous city before ‘The Day’. Surrounding them, for many miles, is a sea of dust and rubble. Your skin prickles when you realize that this is all that remains of the city’s suburbs, an area that was once home to more than a million Texans.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="78" width="386" src="small5.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>You are about to drive towards the centre when you notice that a fortified wall has been erected around the tall buildings of the downtown area, and that the northern highway approaches are controlled by roadblocks. It would be near-suicidal to approach any closer, so you decide to make a wide detour around the city limits and try to approach from the south.</p>
<p>It takes you nearly two hours to reach the south side of San Angelo, by which time night has fallen. Fortunately, your decision to go south pays off; this section of the city is virtually uninhabited by the Angelinos and your approach goes undetected. Hidden by the darkness, you are able to get within a mile of the downtown area before you encounter any sign of clan activity. You know that if your rescue of Kate is to be successful you must not allow your roadster to fall into enemy hands, and with this in mind, you search for somewhere safe to leave it while you venture into the downtown area on foot.</p>
<p>An underground parking lot situated below the looted ruins of a Sears megamarket provides just such a safe haven, and it is here that you hide your car. You are tired after the rigours of your journey, so you decide to get a few hours’ sleep and attempt your rescue at first light.</p>

<p>You retrace your steps all the way back to the front lobby, continue across it, and enter the other corridor. This services a number of offices and conference rooms before it ends at a wide staircase leading downwards. You descend three floors and discover the remains of a large private restaurant which, along with its kitchen, occupies most of the sub-basement level. A small ‘fire exit’ sign hangs over the double doors leading to the kitchen and you head straight for it.</p>
<p>As you are crossing the restaurant floor, your rumbling stomach reminds you that you have yet to eat anything today. Then the thought occurs to you that there may still be some canned food in the kitchen, and you resolve to search it before you leave the building.</p>

<p>Eventually, the clansmen return to their motorcycles and ride out of Eldorado, heading south. With the immediate threat now gone, you decide to remain where you are and snatch a few hours’ sleep before continuing your journey at dawn.</p>

You are less than a mile from the ruins of Sonora when you are greeted by the welcome sight of Interstate 10, stretching east-to-west across your path. This is the freeway that you hope will take you all the way to your rendezvous with the colony at Kent, and then on through the mountains to El Paso.</p>
<p>You join the freeway and enjoy the feel of a firmer, clearer road surface beneath your wheels as you begin the long drive west. Still you can see no sign of the Angelinos, and Kate voices her hope that they have decided to search Sonora, thinking you may have hidden there last night. You want to agree with her, but suddenly, in the distance, you see something that proves her wrong.</p>

<p>The convoy leaves the sanctuary of Big Spring with its headlights blazing and its gas pedals pressed flat to the floor. The deafening motor noise rolls across the surrounding land like thunder, and the twisted auto wrecks that litter this section of Interstate 20 seem to flash past with ever-increasing speed as you accelerate your car into the slipstream of the school bus. Above, you see a smoky pinpoint of fire climb into the night sky, and then explode with a brilliant flash. It is a signal flare, and it has been launched by the startled group of Maverick gang lookouts, who are manning a barricade less than half a mile ahead.</p>
<p>The barricade comprises a line of old cars and other debris that has been dragged into a haphazard line across the freeway. As the tow truck screams towards its centre, you can just hear the crackle of automatic gunfire above the roar of the convoy’s engines. Then, with a grinding crash, the truck slams into the barricade and ploughs straight through without slowing. Torn and buckled sheets of rusty metal are spun skywards, together with the bodies of those Mavericks too slow to jump clear. Still in line, the convoy follows Pecos Pete through the ragged gap carved by his truck. As you approach it, you grit your teeth and tighten your grip on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>To your right you notice the steep embankment that borders this section of the freeway. An old panel truck is perched near the top of the slope, held there in defiance of gravity by blocks of concrete that are wedged in front of its wheels. Feverishly two Mavericks are trying to pull away these chocks and, as you reach the gap, they succeed. Your stomach churns as the panel truck comes careering down the embankment on a collision course with your car.</p>

A stream of the precious liquid is escaping from a bullet hole in the tanker’s side, and, as you draw level with the cab, you signal anxiously to Uncle Jonas to stop at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>You have covered less than a mile when the freeway approaches the ruins of Stanton, a town long since looted and forgotten by the Mavericks, and you bring the convoy to a halt. Pecos Pete offers to help Uncle Jonas patch up the damage, and while you are waiting for them to finish their work, you ask Cutter to help you tell the rest of the colony your plan to rescue Kate. At first there are many who think you are being crazy and irresponsible. But gradually, after listening to Cutter’s pleas on your behalf, they relent and finally consent to your rescue attempt.</p>

The deep thud of the explosion shakes the walls and sends a gout of smoke and flame gushing into the corridor. When the smoke clears, you rush into the room and find the sniper lying dead at the foot of the window with his rifle still clutched in his hands. (If you wish to keep this weapon, you discover that it contains eight rounds of 7.62mm ammunition.)</p>
<p>You shout an ‘all clear’ to the others in the street below and then turn to leave the flame-scorched room.</p>

The land here is far too rough for you to be able to drive at speed and, as you glance in your mirror, you are sorely aware that the bikers are closing the gap. Your only chance of escape is to find a way across the river and get back onto the highway.</p>
<p>Kate too senses the danger, and knows what must be done. She keeps her eyes peeled on the river, looking for somewhere suitable to cross, while you negotiate a way through the boulders that lie scattered in your path.</p>
<p>‘Over there, Cal!’ she shouts, pointing to a shallow-sided section of the river bank. Immediately you steer towards it and power your car down the gentle slope towards the foul-smelling water. Here, the tainted river is less than a foot deep and the rocky bed provides a firm grip for your tyres.</p>
<p>You are halfway across when you hear a dull thud. Suddenly there is a flash of orange-red flame and a column of splintered rocks and black water erupts from the river a few feet ahead. The clansmen are firing grenades!</p>

<p>Your gunfire misses the clansman by a wide mark, causing him to throw back his head and laugh. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Then he veers off the highway and takes to the open ground. You set your weapon aside, but you are as determined as ever not to let the clansman escape, so you pull the steering wheel hard over to the left and pursue him as he guns his bike cross-country towards Highway 87.</p>
<p>An empty concrete drainage ditch runs parallel to the freeway, wide enough to deter the biker from attempting to ride straight across. At the last minute he veers away and you chase him along its edge for nearly half a mile before finally he plucks up enough courage to try to get across. Ahead, a derelict pump house looms, straddling the ditch, its angular roof offering itself as a ramp that could be used to launch a jump onto the freeway. The clansman takes one last look at you over his shoulder and then, with a scream of fearful exhilaration, he winds back the throttle and points his bike at the pump house roof.</p>

<p>The wide corridor into which you have emerged is empty at present, but the sound of running footsteps is growing louder with each passing second, and it will not be very long before the area is teeming with clansmen.

<p>You tell the soldiers who you are and how you came to be here in Fort Stockton. At first, they listen to your fantastic account with cool scepticism. They cross-examine you both in an attempt to find a flaw in your story, but when they are unable to find any, their attitude begins to change. By the time they have finished their interrogation, you have managed to win their respect and admiration.</p>
<p>Once they are convinced that you are genuine colonists they recount their own tale. They are WDF marines who, before ‘The Day’, were stationed at an underground tracking facility in Brownsville, Texas. Twelve of their unit survived the post-holocaust years, but soon after their return to the surface they were the victims of a clan attack. They were the only survivors of the attack and were forced to flee Brownsville on foot. Eventually they managed to find a vehicle that worked—the pick-up truck—and had got this far when the fuel ran out and the engine broke down. They are trying to reach their command headquarters at Fort Bliss, located just north of El Paso, where they hope to rejoin remnants of their unit. They arrived in Fort Stockton three days ago and have been prevented from continuing their journey on foot by the blistering day temperatures and the fierce night storms that have swept down from the Barrilla Mountains.</p>
<p>They have set up camp in the ruins of a nearby motel and they invite you there to share their food and drink, and to formulate a plan to find some fuel for your roadster. Their provisions are basic but you receive them gratefully: restore 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>As the noise of the explosion fades and the smoke thins, you approach the door to discover that the padlock no longer exists. Firmly you push open the shrapnel-pitted door and enter the hangar-like interior. Inside you find an armoured truck, one of many that were once used by banks to transport cash and bullion around Texas. This one was hijacked shortly before ‘The Day’, and was brought here, where its cargo was to have been shared out by the robbers. However, they never had a chance to divide and spend their loot, and the vehicle still contains over thirty million dollars in cash, a sum now completely worthless.</p>

<p>Having briefed the convoy, you return to Sergeant Haskell on the freeway outside Fabens.</p>
<p>‘The convoy’s ready to roll straight through here as soon as they see my signal flare,’ you inform him.</p>

<p>The race is about to begin. Eight bikers are drawn up in a line at one end of the arena, each man standing astride his machine and revving its engine in response to the loud cheers of the clansmen watching. The riders have their eyes fixed on a pot-bellied Angelino who is perched atop a wooden tower in the centre of the track. Above his head he holds a chequered flag, and, as he brings his arm down, the crowd screams and the riders surge away from the line.</p>
<p>Under cover of the noise and commotion of the race, you approach the observation block. An enclosed corridor leads to a flight of iron stairs where two burly clansmen—one an Angelino, the other a Detroit Lion—stand on guard with machine pistols at the ready. At the top of the stairs is the door to the block itself. The noise of the crowd and the roar of the motorcycles have helped you so far, but the race is now into its fourteenth lap, and you know that if you are to succeed in freeing Kate you must get past these guards and storm the observation block before the race ends.</p>

<p>It is almost noon when you drive into Brogado. The storm-shattered ruins of this mountain town do not inspire much hope of finding fuel, and, after making a thorough search of its two gas stations, your initial fears are confirmed: one station has been looted and the other has been gutted by fire.</p>
<p>It is beginning to look as though you will have to walk the last thirty miles to Kent when Marine Gunter sees a station wagon backed up to the entrance of a drug store, and he calls it to your attention. All five of you are walking along the main street towards the vehicle when a shot rings out from the first floor window of the store, and Gunter is brought to the ground, clutching his bloodstained chest.</p>
<p>‘Sniper!’ shouts Sergeant Haskell. ‘Hit the deck!’</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth and Perception skill scores.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 10 or less, <a href="#sect257">turn to 257</a>.</p>

<p>You unshoulder your gun and take aim in one swift, fluid movement. The clansman is drawing back the bolt of his G-12 when you unleash a round, catching him full in the chest. The force of your gunfire lifts him off the kitchen floor and kills him instantly. Slowly you lower your smoking barrel and walk forward to search the body of your would-be killer. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="#action">Ammo Pouch</a>.)</p>
<p>Judging from the long-horned skull painted on the back of his leather vest, you have just laid to rest your first Angelino. On the floor nearby you find his weapons and equipment: a Machine Pistol (containing eighteen rounds of 9mm ammunition) and a Backpack, which holds the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible Saw</li>
<li>HE Grenade</li>
<li>Water Canteen (containing enough water for three Drinks)</li>
<li>Small Blanket</li>
<li>Enough bandages, sulfonamides, and antiseptics for three Medi-kit units</li>
<li>Knife (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these items, a search of the kitchen also reveals the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meat Cleaver (3)</li>
<li>Bread Knife (2)</li>
<li>Enough canned food for five Meals</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to keep any of the items in either list, remember to adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>Before leaving the kitchen you hide the clansman’s body in an empty refrigerator. Then you hurry through the fire escape door and make your way up a flight of rusty steps that leads to a service alley at the rear of the building.</p>

<p>You prime your weapon and spring into the room like a tiger. A man is crouched by an open window, and, as you move towards him, he turns to meet your attack with a rifle clutched firmly in his hands. Instinctively, you raise your gun and fire a snap shot from the hip.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Shooting skill score.</p>
<p>If the weapon you are using is a Shotgun or a Machine Pistol, add 2 points to your total. If the weapon you are using is a Pistol or a Rifle, subtract 1 point from your total.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 6 or less, <a href="#sect31">turn to 31</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 7 or more, <a href="#sect103">turn to 103</a>.</p>

<p>There is a brilliant flash followed by a thunderous explosion that rips a wide hole in the centre of the barricade. Those clansmen who have survived the blast run in confusion as the hot remnants of their mighty wall rain down on their heads. Haskell fires the flare, and within a few minutes the convoy appears, thundering along the freeway with the tow truck in the lead. You climb back into your roadster and follow in their wake as they stream through the shattered barricade and on towards El Paso unchallenged.</p>
<p>You receive a warm welcome from the WDL troops, who are defending the city and the military reserve. Then you celebrate the success of your mission and your bold defeat of the Mexican clansmen at the Fabens barricade.</p>
<p>You have indeed earned the right to celebrate, for you have freed Kate from her abductors and reached El Paso, thereby achieving everything you set out to do when you left Big Spring eight days ago.</p>
<p>The celebrations continue in El Paso for several days until the victorious mood is soured by the arrival of Mad Dog Michigan and an army of clansmen over a thousand strong. He has persuaded the Mexicans to join his cause and now they surround El Paso with a ring of steel.</p>
<p>Mad Dog has promised to avenge the death of his brother. Now he reaffirms that vow and delivers the additional threat that neither you, nor any of your colony, will ever get out of El Paso alive.</p>
<p>For you, Cal Phoenix, the chance to defy Mad Dog Michigan’s threat and continue your life-or-death journey to California awaits you in Book 3 of the <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> series entitled:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[<a name="equipmnt-1-foot" href="#equipmnt-1">1</a>]  (<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a>) If you have already completed the previous <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> adventure in <a href="../../fw/01hh/title.htm#title"><cite>Highway Holocaust</cite></a>, it is unclear whether you may replenish your supplies before starting this adventure or whether you can only carry over the supplies you carried at the end of the previous adventure. It seems reasonable that you would be able to restock your supplies while in Big Spring before setting off for El Paso.</p><p>[<a name="weapons-1-foot" href="#weapons-1">2</a>]  (<a href="#weapons">Weapons</a>) It is reasonably clear that the Machine Pistol should not be used if you have fewer than 6 rounds of 9mm ammunition.</p><p>For some readers, however, it may seem counterintuitive to have ammunition left but be unable to use the weapon. We suggest to these readers that when 9mm ammunition falls below 6 rounds, the Machine Pistol can be treated as a Pistol (cf. <a href="../../fw/01hh/title.htm#sect333">Section 333 of <cite>Highway Holocaust</cite></a>). While this is not a perfect solution, it is a reasonable compromise.</p>
<p>[<a name="sect44-1-foot" href="#sect44-1">3</a>]  (<a href="#sect44">Section 44</a>) Use of this Medi-kit does not restore any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in this instance.</p><p>[<a name="sect52-1-foot" href="#sect52-1">4</a>]  (<a href="#sect52">Section 52</a>) This is the correct answer to the security valve puzzle in <a href="#sect129">Section 129</a>.</p><p>[<a name="sect129-1-foot" href="#sect129-1">5</a>]  (<a href="#sect129">Section 129</a>) The section corresponding to the correct answer will have a footnote confirming that it is indeed correct.</p><p>[<a name="sect233-1-foot" href="#sect233-1">6</a>]  (<a href="#sect233">Section 233</a>) It is possible that you may not be carrying a missile weapon at this point. This is a game-design issue that cannot be easily rectified.</p><p>[<a name="sect328-1-foot" href="#sect328-1">7</a>]  (<a href="#sect328">Section 328</a>) This Stealth penalty is probably in addition to the penalty for carrying more than 3 Backpack Items (e.g. if the Leviathan Missile is your fourth Backpack Item, you incur a 3-point penalty rather than just 2). Alternatively, you may read it to mean that the Leviathan Missile gives a 2-point penalty irrespective of how many other Backpack Items you are carrying.</p></div>
