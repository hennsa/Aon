   <p><strong>In the World of Lone Wolf a new hero has arisen—Grey Star the Wizard</strong></p>

   <p>You are Grey Star. From the core of a raging storm you appeared—a human child, ship-wrecked and orphaned, a gift of hope to the exiled Shianti sorcerers. Ever since that fateful night they have raised you as one of their own, teaching you the mysteries of their magic in preparation for an epic quest.</p>

   <p>The time has now come. You must find the legendary Moonstone and with its power crush the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki. For only you can save the land of your birth from the cruel grip of his empire. But be warned! Ahead lies a terrifying journey into the unknown where survival or death confronts you with every turn of the page.</p>

   <p><strong>The World of Lone Wolf</strong> is an exciting adventure series in which you are the hero, you make the decisions, and you fight the combats using the unique systems included in the book.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Ian Page</strong> was born in London in 1960. Since the age of sixteen he has pursued a successful career as a singer/songwriter. With the band Secret Affair, he had a string of chart hits to his credit including <cite>Time for Action</cite> and <cite>My World</cite>. His interest in the fantastic worlds of ‘Sword and Sorcery’ dates back to his early teens, and to his love of the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien and Michael Moorcock. It was in 1979, when Joe Dever introduced him to role-playing games, that his involvement in the world of Magnamund began. He contributed greatly to the development of the southern reaches of this fantastic world, and worked closely with Joe on several other role-playing games projects that include TV and radio appearances.</p>

   <p>Ian has since re-entered the music industry with a band known as <a href="http://www.theaffair.co.uk/">The Affair</a>.</p>


      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels and editor for the World of Lone Wolf series, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Paul Bonner</strong> is the illustrator of the World of Lone Wolf series of gamebooks. His childhood love of ‘folk-tales, fairy-stories, <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, Scandinavian tales, myths, and sagas’ led Paul Bonner to spend four years at Harrow, a London art school, on an illustrating course of study.</p>

   <p>His artwork for the <cite>World of Lone Wolf</cite> series is among his earliest professional work. He subsequently started freelancing for Games Workshop and later accepted a full-time position. He worked there for a few years before moving on to produce full-colour artwork (which Games Workshop had not required from him). He moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and again began to work as a freelance illustrator.</p>

<h2><a name="coming">Of the Coming of Grey Star</a></h2>

<p>Ancient days they were when first the Shianti set foot upon the land that men call Magnamund. Long had they journeyed through the void, homeless wanderers in search of a place to call their own. And so it was that when the Shianti first looked upon the face of the land, their hearts were raised in wonder. They saw a world of nameless mountains, untamed forests, and lands both wild and free. Here they chose to cease their wanderings and to devote themselves to the study and appreciation of this newfound land.</p>
<p>To the delight of the Shianti, the race of man first emerged at this time and they watched his early struggle towards civilization with eager concern. Like gods the Shianti seemed to the minds of primitive men. Tall and proud, shining with a radiance that spoke of magic and arcane mystery, the Shianti moved among them and with their powers of wizardry, aided man in his development.</p>
<p>As the centuries passed, man fell to worship of the magical Shianti and the power of these wizards grew even stronger. With hungry hearts they sought to unlock the mysteries of knowledge, sending their minds into other planes of existence and strange worlds beyond the sphere of the material plane. Their foresight was now unmatched and the power of their thought was mighty indeed. It was at this time that they created the Moonstone. Woven of the very fabric of the astral plane of Daziarn, this translucent gem was the greatest achievement of Shianti wisdom. It was the binding force of all Shianti magic, containing the combined might of all their wizardry, the sum of all their knowledge. The Golden Age of the Shianti had come and the Moonstone was the instrument of their dominion throughout all Magnamund. Man stood as little more than a shadow, blinded by the shining white light of Shianti glory. But, in creating the Moonstone, the unwritten laws of nature had been transgressed. For the Moonstone, like the Shianti themselves, was something outside of man’s own world; it defied the natural order laid down by the creators of Magnamund and disrupted the balance that the gods had designed.</p>
<p>The Goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon and mother of all men, showed herself to the Shianti and spoke to them of the destiny of man: ‘The children of this world must claim their inheritance. Their time has come and they must learn to stand alone. They are lost in their worship of you and the day draws ever nearer when they will covet the power of the Moonstone.’</p>
<p>And the Shianti said: ‘Forgive us, Great Goddess, for we intended no harm. We love mankind even as you do. We have sought to do good and protect your children from harm.’</p>
<p>But Ishir replied, ‘Of this there can be no doubt, but this world is not your realm. Man must be free to pursue his destiny alone, and you must leave, for you trespass on his domain.’</p>
<p>The Shianti were filled with sorrow. They feared a return to the void and to their lonely wandering, and pleaded with Ishir that she might allow them to remain. Ishir was filled with pity for them. She spoke again, saying, ‘If you are to remain, you must obey my command. You must take a vow never to interfere with mankind’s fate. As a token of good faith you must lay aside the Moonstone, and return it to the plane where it belongs.’</p>
<p>Solemnly, the Shianti agreed. The vow was sworn before Ishir, and the Moonstone was returned to the Daziarn. The Shianti then moved south to the Isle of Lorn. They encircled their new home with a web of enchantments, magical mists, and mage winds to prevent man from ever finding their place of refuge in the Sea of Dreams. Knowledge of the Shianti faded with time, save in southern Magnamund where it became enshrined in legend, and the worship of them endured. Priests of the Shianti religion preserved their teachings and patiently awaited the day when the ‘ancient ones’ would return, bringing with them lasting peace and the blessing of a new golden age.</p>
<p>Two thousand years strode by and man advanced as Ishir had foretold. He built great cities and cultivated the land; his kingdoms rose and fell; he made war and loved and laughed and became master of his fate. But a new power was emerging in the province of Shadaki. There Shasarak the evil Wytch-king ruled. The black necromancer commanded an army of brutal soldiers and had a devoted following of men who upheld his religion of demonic worship and sacrificial rites. Devotees of the Shianti and other religious cults were persecuted in a merciless purge. Ruthlessly, the Wytch-king destroyed all his opponents and began a terrible war with the peoples of the neighbouring provinces. From the ruins of war Shasarak shaped the Shadakine Empire, subjugating whole nations to his evil rule. As the provinces fell to his might, the Shianti looked on helplessly, bound by their vow to the Goddess Ishir never to interfere in the affairs of man.</p>
<p>On the night of the crowning of Shasarak as Overlord of the Shadakine Empire, a great storm broke upon the Sea of Dreams, a storm that raged with unnatural intensity. Lashed by wind and rain, illuminated by wild lightning, the waters heaved and danced in fury to the thundering music of the storm, unchecked by even the enchantments of the Shianti. When finally the tempest died, the Shianti looked out in amazement on the shattered hull of a ship drifting towards their shore. Never before had this occurred, for the enchantments and mage winds had kept them secure from the curiosity of man by forcing him to sail close to his own land.</p>
<p>The Shianti went quickly to the ruined ship where they found only one survivor—a baby. They perceived the sudden arrival of this human child as a sign of great portent, and they conceived a plan by which they might lawfully aid mankind. They named the orphan child Grey Star, because a star is the symbol of hope in the Shianti faith, and because of the silver streak in the child’s jet-black hair. In the shadow of the wrath of the Goddess Ishir, they raised the child as one of their own and taught him their secrets. Diligently they set about their instruction, for their aim was to provide a saviour for mankind. Armed with the might of Shianti wizardry and wisdom, their hope was to create an adversary equal in power to the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki, for they realized that only with the death of Shasarak would man once more be free to determine his destiny.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Grey Star, trained in the secret arts of a Shianti wizard. Sixteen years have passed since you arrived on the Isle of Lorn, the hidden realm of the Shianti race, when you are called to a meeting of your Shianti masters.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star,’ says Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, ‘you have been summoned to this meeting so that we may lay before you a quest of great importance. Your people, the race of man, are slaves of an evil tyrant, Shasarak the Wytch-king of Shadaki. He has made pacts with demons and has captured the spirits of the dead who do his bidding as undead slaves. He has the power to control the minds of men; none can resist him and the land of your birth cries out in fear of the cruel hand that crushes its heart. No power remains intact to challenge the might of the Wytch-king. Our ancient vow to the Goddess Ishir forbids us from intervening in the fate of man, and the Moonstone now lies hidden on another plane. We have taught you the ways of Shianti magic in the hope that one day you would take up this quest—to recover the Moonstone and use its power to destroy the Wytch-king. You are human. No vow prohibits you from leaving the Isle of Lorn, nor are you forbidden to aid mankind in any way you choose. No charge is laid upon you to accept the quest, yet if you refuse, your people will be doomed to a choice between slavery and destruction at the hands of the Wytch-king of Shadaki.’</p>
<p>Bravely and without hesitation, you give Acarya your decision, but your voice trembles as you speak: ‘I accept the quest of the Moonstone. What must I do?’</p>
<p>There are sighs of relief all round. ‘You have made us proud this day, son of man,’ says Acarya, smiling. ‘The Moonstone lies hidden in the Daziarn plane, which can only be entered by locating its portal. We know this can be found in the lands of men: it is called the “Shadow Gate”. However, it rarely remains in any one location for more than a day and is invisible to human sight. For this reason you must seek out the Lost Tribe of Lara, a race of primitive but magical creatures we call the Kundi. They possess the gift of astral vision, which enables them to see the Shadow Gate. Once, long ago, the Kundi inhabited the forests and mountains of Lara. Before the Shadakine army invaded the free provinces of the south, they passed through the mountains of Lara, using the Morn Pass. There the Shadakine army were frequently ambushed and delayed by the Kundi, who always disappeared into the safety of the forests before the Shadakine could retaliate. Finally, in desperation, the Wytch-king burnt the forests, and the Kundi were forced to flee. To this day, no one is sure where the Kundi went, and consequently men refer to them as the Lost Tribe of Lara. Your first task is to find the lost tribe and persuade them to guide you to the Shadow Gate. Your training is incomplete but you must begin without delay. The Shadakine Empire now stretches to the very shores of the Sea of Dreams, and the power of the Wytch-king grows with each passing day. Our presence is known to him and his attention is often turned towards us, probing our defences and testing the measure of our powers. He is hungry for new conquest, and though he fears us, the day is sure to come when he will cross the Sea of Dreams to challenge the Shianti.’</p>
<p>Acarya places his hands upon your shoulders and looks deeply into your eyes. ‘The fate of humanity and of the Shianti depends on the success of your quest. Find the Moonstone, Grey Star…You are our only hope; if you fail then all is lost.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>To keep a record of your adventure, use the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Before you set off on your adventure, you must discover how well your Shianti masters have prepared you for your quest by determining your fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—your state of mind—<small>WILLPOWER</small>—and your physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. To do this take a pencil and, with eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your <small>WILLPOWER</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>WILLPOWER</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have a <small>WILLPOWER</small> of 26). If you decide to use a spell or utilize the power of your Wizard’s Staff, then you will lose <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. If at any time your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you may not use any of your spells<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">1</a></sup> or your Wizard’s Staff.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">2</a></sup> Lost <small>WILLPOWER</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, and it is possible for your <small>WILLPOWER</small> points to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p>The third number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). If you are wounded in combat, you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure but can never rise above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<h3><a name="powers">Magical Powers</a></h3>

<p>When you start your adventure, your education in the ways of wizardry is incomplete. You have mastered only <em>five</em> of the seven Magical Powers that the Shianti call the Lesser Magicks. The choice of which five Powers these are is up to you. All of the Lesser Magicks may be of use to you at some point on your quest, so choose them with care. Your survival may depend on the correct use of a Magical Power at the right time.</p>
<p>The seven Magical Powers available to you are listed below. When you have chosen your five Powers, enter them in the Magical Powers section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sorcery">Sorcery</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="122" width="386" src="sorcery.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Power allows a wizard to transform his thoughts or desires into magical energy. By concentration of the will it is possible to create magical shields of force to bar doors or move objects. Sorcery drains more <small>WILLPOWER</small> points than any other Magical Power, and is most effective when your <small>WILLPOWER</small> points are high.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Sorcery’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="enchant">Enchantment</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="130" width="386" src="enchant.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others. He will be able to extract information from others, place thoughts and compulsions into another’s mind, or cause them to believe that imaginary events are actually taking place. Some magical or highly intelligent beings may be immune to the powers of Enchantment.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Enchantment’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="elementl">Elementalism</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="118" width="386" src="elementl.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of elemental magic allows a wizard some control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth, and Water. By entering a trance and chanting incantations, you may summon aid from the spirits of the Elemental Plane. Elementals have very little understanding of man, and for this reason a wizard can never be sure of the nature of the aid the Elementals may send.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Elementalism’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="alchemy">Alchemy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="121" width="386" src="alchemy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>A wizard who possesses the Power of Alchemy is able, through the mixing of various substances, to create magical potions. Given the correct ingredients, a potion may restore lost energy (i.e. <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, <small>WILLPOWER</small>), or temporarily improve various abilities (e.g. <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>). The use of Alchemy may also allow a wizard to alter the nature of substances (e.g. change lead into gold), but the necessary ingredients and the correct equipment (e.g. a pestle and mortar) must be at hand. The use of the Power of Alchemy drains no <small>WILLPOWER</small>.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power write ‘Alchemy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="prophecy">Prophecy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="123" width="386" src="prophecy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of Prophecy allows a wizard to foretell the future through meditation. A meditative state will allow a wizard to make the correct decision when facing conflicting choices or difficult actions; to discover the whereabouts of a person he has once met, or an object he has once seen. It may also allow him to determine the true nature of a stranger or a strange object. Magical beings or objects are sometimes hidden from the Power of Prophecy.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Prophecy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psycmncy">Psychomancy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="126" width="386" src="psycmncy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Power bestows upon a wizard the ability to deduce facts about events by touching objects connected to them. Through deep concentration, a wizard may lay his hands upon any inanimate object and visualize scenes that have affected it. Visions brought about through the use of Psychomancy are often cryptic, taking the form of a riddle or puzzle. Some magic items are resistant to the use of Psychomancy and may, sometimes, impart misleading information.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Psychomancy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="evcation">Evocation</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="131" width="386" src="evcation.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Mastery of this Power permits contact with the spirit realm. A wizard wishing to speak with the dead, or to call up a form from the spirit world, must draw a magic pentacle and enter a trance, when the use of the correct spell-chant will reach out to the Spiritual Plane. Standing within the protection of a magic pentacle, a wizard may consider himself to be relatively safe from harm. If he wishes to speak with a corpse, especially one whose former life was good and righteous, then a wizard can expect help and advice. However, contact with those whose former lives were evil or selfish can be a perilous, and often fatal, experience. Evil spirits are reluctant to return to the realm of the dead and may try to trick a wizard into freeing them into the world of the living. All spirits, good and evil, will require some service of the wizard in return for their aid. Any failure to perform this task, however difficult may result in the wizard losing his life.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Evocation’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="staff">Wizard’s Staff</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="staff.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Your Staff is your most valuable possession. It looks and feels like an ordinary quarterstaff, yet it is stronger than any known metal. This is your main combat weapon, for you are untrained in the use of any other form of armed combat. It contains a potent force that is unleashed at will by the power of your mind, and causes a beam of destructive power to hurtle from its tip. Every time you unleash this power you must deduct 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point.<sup><a href="#powers-1-foot" name="powers-1">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In the event that your enemy survives such an attack or should you fall victim to a surprise attack, you will be forced to engage in close combat and must attempt to strike your enemy with the Staff. If your attack is successful, a bolt of energy will be released from the Staff that is capable of inflicting great physical harm. If you wish to increase the amount of damage that you inflict in this way, you must use more <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and multiply the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by the enemy, accordingly. For example, if you chose to expend 3 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points on your attack, all enemy <small>ENDURANCE</small> point losses would be multiplied by three.</p>
<p>If you enter combat without your Staff, deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>You wear the grey robe and hooded cloak of a Shianti Wizard. Your only weapon is your Wizard’s Staff (note this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> under Weapons). You wear a Backpack containing 4 Meals (note under Meals on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>), and you have been given a <a href="#map">map of the Shadakine Empire</a> (note under Special Items on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) which you place inside your robe.</p>
<p>If you have chosen Alchemy as one of your Magical Powers, then you will have a leather pouch for herbs and potions hanging from your belt. The Herb Pouch contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 empty Vials for carrying potions</li>
<li>1 Vial containing Saltpetre</li>
<li>1 Vial containing Sulphur</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark these 4 items in your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Your Herb Pouch will carry a maximum of eight items.</p>
<p>On your last day on the Isle of Lorn, your Shianti Masters offer you the following gifts to aid you in your quest. According to Shianti custom, you may choose one of them. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jewelled Dagger (Special Item) This adds 1 point to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> when used in combat.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Magic Talisman (Special Item) This adds 2 points to your <small>WILLPOWER</small> total.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-2-foot" name="equipmnt-2">5</a></sup></li>
<li>Vial of Laumspur (Backpack Item) This restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for one dose.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have made your choice, mark the item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> under the headings given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small>, <small>WILLPOWER</small>, or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> totals.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You do not need to make notes, but you should refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wizard’s Staff—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Backpack—slung over the shoulder.</li>
<li>Meals—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Jewelled Dagger—tucked into your belt.</li>
<li>Magic Talisman—worn on a chain around your neck</li>
<li>Vial of Laumspur—carried in the Backpack.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>. Your Wizard’s Staff counts as one weapon.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>

<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>

<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-3-foot" name="equipmnt-3">6</a></sup></p>

<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember that you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at any one time.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.</dd>
<dt>Currency</dt>
<dd>The currency of the Shadakine Empire is the Noble, which is a small jade stone. The system of money is alien to the Shianti, and for this reason you begin your adventure with no money.

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Grey Star’s aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Grey Star’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total, based on the weapon you are using. (Remember, if you enter combat without your Staff, you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points.)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">If you are using your Wizard’s Staff</a>, decide how many <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you wish to use. (Remember, you must expend at least 1 point.) Enter this number on your Combat Record in the box marked <small>WILLPOWER</small>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Grey Star (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15, <small>WILLPOWER</small> 23) is ambushed by a Deathgaunt (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but he can use his Wizard’s Staff against the creature as it swoops down on him. He subtracts the Deathgaunt’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −5. (15 − 20 = −5). −5 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio. Grey Star decides to use 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, which is noted on the <small>WILLPOWER</small> box of the Combat Record.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>When you have decided upon the number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you wish to use and have determined your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a> on the inside back cover of the book. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked. (The random numbers appear on the side of the chart.) You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by Grey Star. To calculate the number lost by the enemy, multiply the number listed for the enemy by the number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points that Grey Star elected to use. Now you have the final number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Grey Star and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GS represents points lost by Grey Star.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Grey Star and the Deathgaunt has been established as −5, and Grey Star’s <small>WILLPOWER</small> points used as 2. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Grey Star loses 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>Deathgaunt loses 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, multiplied by 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, giving a total of 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in all.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat, and Grey Star’s amended <small>WILLPOWER</small> points total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Grey Star are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Grey Star is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Grey Star proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Grey Star may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="sage">Sage Advice</a></h2>

<p>You are about to embark on a quest of great peril, for your journey will take you to an unknown land that is dominated by evil. Refer to the <a href="#map">map</a> and make notes as you progress through the story: they are sure to be of great help to you in future adventures.</p>
<p>You will discover items that could be of help to you on your quest. Some Special Items may aid you in future <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures, others may be red herrings of no real use at all; so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>Be cautious in your use of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, as your <small>WILLPOWER</small> is the energy source for your Magical Powers and your Wizard’s Staff. A <small>WILLPOWER</small> score of zero or below will leave you weak and vulnerable to attack, unable to offer effective resistance.</p>

<p>It is a grim, chill morning, your last on the Isle of Lorn. With quaking heart, you enter the sacred temple of Amida to receive the silent blessing of your Shianti masters. They stand around you, heads bowed in meditation. At length, the ceremony ends and Maiteya, your old friend and teacher, steps forward, and grasps you firmly by the shoulders. You look into his glittering eyes and see yourself reflected there, for the eyes of the Shianti race are not coloured like man’s but have pupils that cast reflections like mirrored glass.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="642" width="386" src="ill1.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration I</strong>—With quaking heart you enter the sacred temple of Amida.
<br /><br /></div><p>‘Grey Star,’ he says, a warm smile lighting his serene face, ‘the time has come for you to leave. Far will you travel and perilous is your course. Be not afraid, yet do not fear caution. Though you go with the teaching and blessing of the Shianti and carry the might of the Wizard’s Staff, stealth and secrecy will be your allies. Let not courage defeat wisdom. Go now and seek the Kundi race that is called the Lost Tribe of Lara. You are the instrument of our will, bearer of our hope. Ever will your quest be in our minds and hearts.’</p>
<p>Without a word, you turn and leave the temple, not looking back until you reach the shore, where a sail boat awaits you. With a gentle sigh, you bid farewell to the island of your youth and push the little craft into the cold waters of the Sea of Dreams. You jump into the boat and set sail, making a westward course for the distant mainland of the Shadakine Empire.</p>

<p>The way leads south through the farms and paddy fields of the region. The path keeps firmly to the line of the Azan River as it curves towards the great Azagad Gorge, a great pitted canyon of weathered limestone columns. In order to maintain the secrecy of your presence, you avoid the homesteads that nestle by the river.</p>
<p>You walk for two long days and must consume 2 Meals or lose 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. The regulated squares of the rice fields become fewer and fewer, and finally give way to a flat expanse of unyielding plains called the Wilderwastes, which are devoid of human habitation. That night, you make camp on the leeward side of a small outcrop of hills.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect24">Turn to 24</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect3">3</a></h3>

<p>You leave the road, and after travelling a short way through the thickening trees, you discover a small clearing sheltered by a large, overhanging Acacia tree.</p>
<p>You decide to rest here. You are hungry and must eat 1 Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, and 2 Meals (if you have any left) must be given to Tanith and Shan. (Remember to cross all these from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>You have no blankets and dare not start a fire for fear of revealing your hiding place, but fortunately it is a warm night. Shan and Tanith insist that you sleep while they take it in turns to keep watch. Wryly, you point out that it is the first time that they have agreed about anything.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>You vault onto the dead tree, using your Staff for support. Hauling yourself to the top, you reach out and grab the thick branch of a Giant Azawood. Your chest contracts with pain every time you draw breath and the humid, fetid air clings to the sides of your throat. Slowly and painfully, you climb the tall tree while the columns of insects march relentlessly towards you, their pincers gnashing and clacking in crazed fury.</p>
<p>Grimly you ignore the savage pain of your wounded leg. Looking up you gasp with dismay, for a line of Cave Mantiz has somehow gained the branch above your head. Those behind are nearly upon you, and in desperation, you clamber along the nearest branch. The further you crawl along the narrowing tree limb, the greater the swaying of the branch as it bends under your weight.</p>
<p>You turn to see a line of insects scurrying along the branch towards you: there is no escape. With one last effort of will you use all your remaining <small>WILLPOWER</small> points in an attempt to clear the branch of the Cave Mantiz.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect350">Turn to 350</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>You hurl a bolt from your Staff at the plant that threatens Shan. It is quickly destroyed by the searing blue flame, but the effort has cost you 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points.</p>

<p class="choice"><a href="#sect42">Turn to 42</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>You push onwards into the heart of the ‘Dragon’s Teeth’. The sun beats savagely on your heads. You lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to heat exhaustion before you reach the far side of the gorge and sight the Great Wall of Azakawa.</p>
<p>In the evening light you regard with awe the towering cliff-face, stretching like a vast curtain of rock from east to west as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>You press on, anxious to reach the Azanam by nightfall.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>You learn that the girl’s name is Tanith. She is a novice in the ways of witchcraft and is in the service of Mother Magri, her protector and guardian. She is very beautiful and has long, dark, unkempt hair and wild green eyes. ‘They say that you are a wizard and that you challenged the truthsay of the Kazim Stone,’ she says, curiously.</p>
<p>‘Of course,’ you reply, a little boastfully, wishing to impress this ragged but winsome creature.</p>
<p>‘That is very bad,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘Mother Magri will have you tortured. The ways of the Shadaki are very cruel. Tonight, you will be taken to the Darkling Room and you will experience great pain and terror.’</p>
<p>‘Then I must escape this place,’ you say, fearfully. ‘Can you help me?’</p>
<p>Tanith gazes at you, a frightened expression on her face. ‘No…No…The danger…I cannot…I dare not!’ She takes a dried flower from the pocket of her dress, and sprinkles its powdered petals into your food. ‘This will help fortify you before your ordeal,’ she explains, her voice trembling. ‘I can do no more.’</p>
<p>She jumps to her feet. ‘I’m sorry…’ She falters, a longing note in her voice, and then she disappears.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>You crawl into the shelter of the tiny cave, scarcely large enough to contain you, and immediately notice a small tunnel leading upwards. The ghostly mist of Lake Shenwu lingers on the cave floor, dimly lighting the rough-hewn ceiling and walls.</p>
<p>You are tired and need to sleep.</p>

<p>Before the Shadakine come any nearer, you loose a bolt of force from your Staff, killing one of them outright. The attack has cost you 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point. The remaining warrior hangs back. At first you think that he has simply lost his nerve, but then notice with sinking heart that more Shadakine are approaching from behind. They are armed with crossbows, which are aimed directly at you.</p>
<p>‘Surrender or die,’ shouts one of the Shadakine.</p>

<p>The forest is very near and it is a dark night. Fortunately, you have not been seen.

<p>You leave the Chansi Hills far behind and cross the Suhni River once more, following its winding course through the dense forest. Tanith continues to summon small game, a sight which you still find disturbing. Shan leads you through the forest, but this time you encounter no Shadakine patrols.</p>
<p>You are not required to exert any Magical Power and may restore your <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points to the value of one half your current totals.

<p>You try to coax some information from him and ask about the legend of the Lost Tribe of Lara. However, he is reluctant to talk, looking away from you and shifting uneasily from one foot to the other, seemingly anxious to be gone.</p>
<p>‘Try the Inn of the Laughing Moon at the end of yonder street,’ he mutters finally. ‘You’ll find plenty of traveller’s talk there.’</p>
<p>Following the direction of his finger, you see a dark, narrow street leading from the harbour area. When you turn back to face him, you find that you are alone. The old man has disappeared into the night.</p>

<p>It appears your new companions put great faith in your leadership: a faith that is only slightly shaken when you admit that you have very little idea of where to go. You explain that your quest is to find the Lost Tribe of Lara (though you do not tell them its origin or true purpose), and suggest that Shan guides you. ‘There is no obligation upon you to remain with me, though,’ you tell Tanith and Shan. ‘You are free to do as you please.’</p>
<p>‘I, for one, have no other place to go,’ says Tanith. ‘Mother Magri was a cruel mistress and I would gladly aid any opponent of the rule of the Wytch-king and his servants.’</p>

<p>The tunnel is very narrow and you have to crawl on your hands and knees. It slopes gently upwards, and as you continue, your body is squeezed tighter and tighter between the smooth stone walls. You feel that you must soon suffocate in the claustrophobic darkness. Then, finally and with great relief, you reach the end of the tunnel and pull yourself through, panting and sweating.</p>
<p>It is still pitch dark, but you are able to stand, and you sense that you are in some kind of cavern.</p>

<p>You journey along the road and, to Shan’s surprise, discover that it is deserted. ‘I can’t understand it,’ he says, puzzled. ‘This road is usually teeming with traders.’</p>
<p>You have been walking for three hours when you sight a wagon parked by the roadside. A group of men are sitting around a campfire near a small grove of trees. ‘Wait here,’ says Shan. ‘I’ll see if I can get some information out of these merchants about the road that lies ahead.’</p>

<p>As the river begins to narrow, the once clear waters of the Azan River become a murky brown. Close to the banks, there are many shallow inlets where stagnant pools and swamps are overgrown with clumps of rope-like tendrils. These tendrils form the branches of a large plant called the Yaku. The tendrils are sensitized vines that snake across the ground towards a pool or into the main river, for the rest of the limestone canyon is arid. At the heart of the Yaku plant is a cluster of sharp points, and Shan warns you to keep well clear of these poisoned barbs.</p>

<p>For three days, you head north towards the Chansi Hills. During this time you regain 3 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. The dense forest provides ample cover for your journey and you manage to avoid the occasional Shadakine patrols quite easily.</p>
<p>You carry no provisions but Tanith is able to feed the whole party. Demonstrating an uncanny mastery over animals, she is able to summon small birds down from the trees and rabbits from their burrows. Then, after calling the mesmerized creatures to her, she coolly wrings their necks. Considering her part done, she insists that Shan should do the cooking and a disgruntled Shan agrees.</p>
<p>Coming at last to the forest’s edge, where it borders on the Chansi Hills, you discover clumps of wild Laumspur growing along the river bank. If you have the Magical Power of Alchemy, you may take some of the Laumspur and store it in your Herb Pouch. (Remember to mark this clump of Laumspur on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.) Swallowing it will enable you to regain 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you do not have the Power of Alchemy and wish to regain 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, you must eat the Laumspur while it is fresh; you cannot take it with you.</p>
<p>You find a shallow ford crossing the Suhni River and stop to stare at the solemn hills ahead. ‘We must go up into the hills to find the cave of Jnana,’ says Tanith.</p>
<p>Suddenly Shan cries out, ‘The enemy is upon us; look—the Najin are coming.’ He points up at the sky.</p>
<p>Looking up, you see a cloud of ape-like beasts with grey skins and black, bat-like wings that propel them towards you at great speed. ‘Do not fear,’ Tanith says rushing forward.</p>
<p>‘But Grey Star,’ says Shan, ‘these monsters are slaves of Shasarak, the Wytch-king. We are betrayed.’</p>

<p>The girl glances towards the old man. ‘I will tell Mother Magri. Perhaps she will want to steal his soul while it still lingers here,’ she says, matter-of-factly. ‘He was a silly priest. He deserved to die. But, perhaps my mistress can put him to some useful task.’</p>
<p>You and Shan stare at her, stunned at the coolness of her tone and the casual way in which she dismisses the torment of a man’s soul. She stares back, unconcerned; her face is a picture of childish innocence, and she seems unaware that she has said anything shocking.</p>

<p>You dash to the far wall, pressing your body close to the tunnel entrance. You hope to be able to surprise whoever, or whatever, is approaching. It is you, however, who is surprised. After a few seconds a huge insect, at least three feet long and tugging laboriously at the carcass of a dead reptile, clambers into the chamber.

The first crossbowman has now reloaded and you know that the odds on your surviving another bolt are very slim. Even if you manage to kill the crossbowman, you will have to fight the officer, and already your shoulder is beginning to stiffen. You are unlikely to be able to fight well in your present state.</p>

<p>The old Shianti priest is about to speak, when he gives a great gasp and dies in your arms. With tears in your eyes, you turn to Shan. ‘He is dead,’ you say sorrowfully.</p>
<p>The merchant hangs his head. ‘Then we are doomed,’ he groans.</p>

<p>Staff held high, spraying magical fire from its tip, you charge the Shadakine with unflinching fury. Shan struggles in your wake.</p>
<p>The Shadakine warriors are thrown into disorder as they attempt to meet this new threat from the rear. Due to their confusion, the knights are able to press home their advantage, gaining ground on their opponents and raising your spirits with shouts of encouragement. You rain fearful blows in all directions with your Wizard’s Staff. At the cost of 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point<sup><a href="#sect94-1-foot" name="sect94-1">14</a></sup>, you fell the nearest Shadakine warrior. Much to his surprise, Shan claims another.</p>
<p>Tanith now reappears armed with a loaded crossbow. Coolly, she aims it at the Shadakine officer. He falls to the ground dead, a crossbow bolt protruding from his neck.</p>

<p>You examine the dungeon door, looking through the keyhole as you consult with Shan. Your Magical Power of Sorcery should enable you to produce sufficient energy to break down the door, but it is certain to require large amounts of <small>WILLPOWER</small> to exert a force great enough to burst the lock. You have no way of telling just how much <small>WILLPOWER</small> the spell will use, and once you have begun you will be committed to seeing it through to the end.</p>

<p>In an instant, your quick reflexes have saved you. You release a bolt of energy, costing 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, that blasts the creature’s head apart. The wound in your leg has lost you 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, and painfully you clamber to your feet, limping from the swarming death behind you. You reach a shaft that leads into the tunnel from above. You peer up it and see light. A way to the surface at last!</p>
<p>Clinging with trembling fingers to the nearly smooth sides of the shaft, you drag yourself up. Desperately, you haul your way up, kicking and stamping at the nightmare that advances from below. Using your last reserves of energy, you finally come to the top of the shaft. You are in a wide glade, surrounded by towering trees and dense foliage.</p>

<p>You have been prowling around the harbour for some time. So far all you have discovered are closed buildings, and shifty strangers passing in and out of the shadows, carrying mysterious loads.</p>
<p>You spot two soldiers patrolling the waterfront. Their heads are shaven save for a long plume of hair that flows from the centre of their scalps. They wear armour of black enamelled steel, decorated with gold designs, and carry lethal-looking scimitars at their sides.

<p>Shan stands motionless, his body frozen with fear. With one hand he holds his sword shakily aloft, while he covers his eyes with the other, peeping through the gaps between his fingers as the Quoku rushes towards him.</p>

<p>You spend a great deal of time preparing yourself, pacing up and down the cell, while Shan looks on, mystified. When you feel you have reached the correct mental state, you focus your attention on the door. Your initial exertion of will has little effect and you gradually increase the strength of the spell. You have already used up 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points when the door begins to creak on its hinges, the thick wood warping. With a surge of effort you throw enough power at the door to use up 3 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. The timbers snap and the joists squeal, but still the lock will not give. A last desperate attempt produces 4 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points of energy that splinters the door. A mighty noise echoes down the corridor as the door crashes to the ground. You have used 4 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and lost 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point due to the prolonged strain!</p>
<p>You and Shan rush to the top of the steps and out into the corridor. Already, further down the passage to your right, you can hear someone shouting. You recognize the voice of the gaoler and the sound of his clanking keys.</p>

<p>You take aim and discharge a bolt of power straight at the top of the column. The Quoku lets out a long, chattering squeal of pain, but survives the force of the 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points of energy that you have exerted. Gouts of black blood flow from the ragged wound in its wing.</p>

<p>You steer for the harbour and, as you near the stone quayside, you stand to furl the sail. You cut a dramatic figure: hair flowing in the wind; the reddening glow of the setting sun at your back, casting your shadow upon the shallow waters of the Sea of Dreams.</p>
<p>The harbour is very busy; crowds of people rush to and fro. Sailors and fishermen line the harbour wall, busily unloading their crafts in an effort to finish before nightfall. You notice a flurry of activity further along the quayside; by the time you reach it, a small crowd has gathered, and you can hear the murmur of excited conversation. You throw up a rope and eager hands reach out to clutch the line, mooring the boat for you.</p>
<p>The crowd has grown and it is now obvious that you are the focus of their attention. You hear snatches of conversation: ‘An Ancient One, an Ancient One from beyond the Sea of Dreams…’; ‘See you there? Surely a Shianti walks amongst us?’; ‘Saw him myself. Came right out of the east, calm as you please!’; ‘God of legend, saviour of our people, hail, hail!’</p>
<p>Hands stretch out in greeting while others try desperately to touch your robe, pushing and pulling, as more and more people struggle for a glimpse of your face. ‘Who but a god could cross the Sea of Dreams. Save us, Lord!’ the crowd begins to shout. ‘Destroy the evil Shadakine. Throw down the Wytch-king!’</p>
<p>You can feel the growing hysteria, and to your dismay, you are lifted up on the shoulders of some of the crowd and carried in the direction of two armed soldiers, who are rushing towards you with their swords drawn.</p>

<p>You gather up the power of your thought, forming a mental shield against the groping fingers of the Kazim Stone. A cloud of displeasure passes across Mother Magri’s face. The magic of the Stone hovers at the edge of your senses; the explorative fingers probe your defence, searching for a weakness, a breach in the psychic wall. Your flesh prickles and creeps as the power of the Stone pries and pulls at your will, yet still you keep it at bay (at the cost of 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point). The old woman scowls, intent upon the glowing Stone.</p>
<p>The intensity of the stone increases and you must use another <small>WILLPOWER</small> point to match its strength. Mother Magri glares at you, her face twisted with frustration. She doubles the force of the Stone’s power, her eyes straining and her breathing beginning to quicken.</p>

<p>You decide on Enchantment as your mode of escape: perhaps the gaoler could be persuaded to open your cell door? A plan forms and you sink into a deep trance, weaving an elaborate illusion in your mind.</p>
<p>‘Fire! Fire!’ you shout, pounding on the door of your cell. Shan looks at you strangely, for there is no sign of any smoke. ‘Gaoler, open up before the whole place burns down!’</p>

No word of the Laranese have I ever heard in the far north, the free kingdoms of the Lastlands, nor here in the Shadakine Empire. No indeed, the only story I ever heard that seemed authentic came to me in the city of Elzian where I was trading with the Magicians of Dessi. There I heard a story of the exile of the Lost Tribe to the cloud forests of the far south, that perilous place named the Azanam. Others, though, speak of the forested Shuri Mountains.’</p>
<p>In a very loud voice, the merchant begins relating one of the many stories he has heard about the Laranese. You notice that many people are turning to stare, muttering and whispering.

<p>An old man sits cross-legged before the cave entrance, staring out across the heights with sightless eyes. Without lifting his head or looking in your direction, he speaks. ‘Who comes? Who disturbs the solitude of Jnana?’</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small6.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>‘It is I, Tanith,’ she says. ‘I bring Grey Star, a great wizard who dares to oppose the evil Wytch-king. He is in need of counsel.’</p>
<p>‘I seek the Lost Tribe of Lara,’ you say, ‘for I have a quest and need their aid.’</p>
<p>The old man is silent for a while. ‘You must go south to the great jungle of the Azanam. The way is fraught with danger, for you must pass through the great Azagad Gorge and the towers of stone known as the “Dragon’s Teeth”.’</p>
<p>‘The Azagad Gorge is a vast canyon and the “Dragon’s Teeth” are the great limestone pinnacles that stand throughout the gorge,’ explains Shan. ‘The Azagad Gorge ends at the great cliffs known as the Wall of Azakawa; the Shenwu Falls lie at their centre. Beyond and above the cliffs is the great cloud forest of the Azanam.’</p>
<p>‘It is a strange land, full of weird and hostile beasts,’ warns Jnana. ‘You are unprepared for such a journey, but I will offer you such gifts as I have to aid you.’</p>
<p>He brings the following items from his cave and motions to you to take your choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Silver Charm (a Special Item that Jnana claims will bring good luck)</li>
<li>Enough food for 5 meals</li>
<li>Broadsword (Weapon)</li>

<p>His name is Madin Rendalim, a Durenese herbwarden, famous throughout the Lastlands of the far north for his knowledge and skill in the healing arts. He is journeying through the provinces of the Shadakine Empire seeking the Druse tree, and the clear, sticky resin beneath its bark—the only known cure for the terrible Red Death plague.</p>
<p>‘I had found the Druse tree growing some distance from here, in the Forest of Fernmost at the foot of the Kashima Mountains. I was returning to Port Suhn to journey back to my home in Hammerdal when these ill-mannered Shadakine brutes refused to let us pass. They have closed the roads around Suhn it seems, searching for some fugitives or outlaws.’</p>

<ul>
<li>Potion of Rendalim’s Elixir (restores 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points)</li>
<li>Enough food for 5 Meals</li>
<li>Pestle and Mortar (Backpack Item)</li>

<p>A piercing cry wakes you with a start. The sickly, old Shianti priest is sitting bolt upright in bed, silhouetted by the pale rays of the moon that shine through the high window of your cell.</p>

Quickly you nod your assent; pressing the old man to continue. ‘In my time here, I have learned the safest route of escape. Other prisoners have told me of it.’ His strained, bloodshot eyes pierce yours with a mad ferocity. ‘I know no way of passing through the door of this cell, but the way beyond the dungeon door is—’</p>

Order this rabble to let me down and show some respect for a woman of my years.’ With this, you begin another shower of slaps and thumps to the great amusement of the Shadakine.</p>

However, the Shadakine Warriors are completely fooled, slapping their thighs and roaring with laughter as the stunned crowd disperses in angry silence.

The first of the creatures climbs gently, rolls to one side and then pulls into a steep dive. The Quoku hurtles towards you with astonishing speed: a hawk in pursuit of its prey.</p>

<p>Panting heavily you sprint up the steep slope of the tunnel. You glance over your shoulder to see many soldier Mantiz scurrying towards you. The tunnel opens into a circular chamber. Leading from the chamber are three exits: two stone corridors, one leading east and one other west, and a narrow tunnel made of earth leading south. You can hear the clack of the insect horde’s pincers echoing along the tunnel. You dare not hesitate now.</p>

<p>You pull as Shan’s ghastly shrieks echo throughout the gorge, but the Quoku is stronger than you, and the Rope is dragged from your friction-burnt hands. (Delete this item from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>).</p>

<p>You decide to look for aid on the Elemental Plane. You drift into a trance and begin to chant, meditating on your need and hoping that the elemental spirits will understand the nature of your predicament. The chant over, you wait. At first, all is quiet and you fear that you have failed. Then a rumbling noise echoes below your feet, and a shuddering tremor makes you stumble.</p>
<p>‘Stand by the wall, away from the centre of the cell,’ you warn Shan. A large crack appears in the ground, widening to a great hole as the head and shoulders of an Earth Giant smash through the floor. You view the gnarled features of the elemental and his rough, mottled skin of clay with fear and apprehension. Earth Giants are the most stupid of elementals, and you doubt if this one will be able to understand fully your needs.</p>

He drags you through the heavy iron doors and throws you to the floor of a sparse, stony entrance hall. The wound has opened again, and warm blood runs down your arm. ‘I’m bleeding,’ you say to the brutish Shadakine guard. ‘I need a Healer. This quarrel must be removed and the wound dressed.’</p>
<p>The Shadakine guard looks at you contemptuously. ‘Wound?…Dressed?…’ He snorts with disgust. ‘That’s just a scratch. I’ve had far worse fighting in the Old Wars of the Empire. No “Healers” on the field then. Where’s your grit, boy?’ He steps towards you and grabs at the bolt shaft.</p>
<p>‘NO!’ you shout, horrified. But before you can stop him, he has torn the bolt from your shoulder, complete with barbed head. You feel that you must faint with pain.</p>
<p>‘Healers…dress the wound…hmph!’ the Shadakine mutters to himself. He produces a flask and pulls out the stopper. ‘This’ll stop the greenrot,’ he says, pouring a clear liquid over the wound in liberal quantities, washing away the blood. The liquid burns like acid, but it quickly staunches the bleeding. The Shadakine laughs and thumps you on the back, making you flinch.</p>

<p>Head bent low, you hurl yourself into the narrow tunnel. It slopes upwards, becoming narrower as it winds and curls like a snake. Ahead you see a lone worker Mantiz coming towards you, holding a large leaf in its pincers. Without hesitation, you dive over the Cave Mantiz, scraping your back against the walls and ceiling of the converging tunnels. A gout of acid misses your body by inches as you tumble to the ground on the other side of the insect. You roll over twice before leaping to your feet once more.</p>
<p>Countless numbers of snapping, malicious insects pursue you, but far ahead you see a dim light which fills you with hope. A faint gust of air blows against your cheek, making you certain that this tunnel connects with the surface. You focus on the dim light and force your aching legs to propel you onwards.</p>
<p>As you draw nearer the flood of light, you see that the tunnel ends at a blank wall. Your spirits sink: are you trapped after all?</p>

<p>A great hooting yell signifies the presence of others in the leaf-green light of the tree tops. Some forty ape­like men with long tails swing bundles of smoking leaves at the end of lengths of vine. The smoke gives off a choking stench that throws the huge insects into confusion. Within a few moments, they have dropped from the branches of the tree or are scurrying back along the trunk, fleeing from the swirling fumes.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="626" width="386" src="ill18.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration XVIII</strong>—The strange stunted men use their tails to swing from tree limb to branch with astonishing ability, and flush out the insect invaders with practised ease.
<br /><br /></div><p>Through watering eyes, you watch the strange, stunted men using their tails to swing from tree limb to branch with astonishing agility, flushing out the insect invaders with practised ease. These are the Kundi. You have found the Lost Tribe of Lara.</p>
<p>As you watch the one-sided battle draw to a close, two sets of hairy arms grab you and lift you bodily into the air. Your ape-like abductors carry you through the giddy heights, leaping and swinging from tree to tree, tossing you like a bale of hay. You are being carried through a fine mist of cloud, from which the Azawood tree draws much of its moisture. Up here, in the highest levels of the forest, is a complex of wooden houses and platforms. You are dumped unceremoniously outside the largest of these tree houses: the house of the Kundi king.</p>
<p>The old king regards you with undisguised displeasure. ‘I am Okosa, Kundi king—why you come and who are you?’</p>
<p>Quietly you tell the king of your quest for the Moonstone of the Shianti, your search for the Shadow Gate and your need of the magical Kundi vision to guide you there.</p>
<p>‘You no Shianti…You bring creeping death from below…Kundi guide you nowhere,’ he says, eyeing you suspiciously. No matter how you try, you cannot convince him that you are a Shianti wizard and that you were trying to escape from the terrible Mantiz attack, not leading it. He turns his back on you with a derisive snort.</p>
<p>‘I can make great magic,’ you say hopefully, ‘ancient magic, <cite>The Way of the Shianti</cite>.’</p>
<p>‘Wytch-king make magic, Shadakine make magic. This prove nothing,’ the king replies with a dismissive wave of the hand.</p>
<p>‘How then, can I prove the truth of my words to you?’ you ask, helplessly.</p>
<p>The Kundi King gives you a sly look over his shoulder, eyebrows raised. ‘Prove?’ he says. ‘Yes, you prove many things, I think, when Urik, wise elder of the Kundi Tribe, has words with you. Then you see some <em>Kundi</em> magic! Not Shadakine spells and whispers.’</p>
<p>Patiently, you wait. Faintly, you can hear the jingling of tiny bells and a hoarse voice chanting a monotonous rhythm, tunelessly. At length, a wizened old Kundi is led into the room. He is covered in bird feathers and numerous small bells, and his mad, bulging eyes roll around their sockets. The Kundi king and the old Kundi’s escorts look to him with reverence, for he is their Shaman and a respected figure in their society. To your eyes, however, he looks faintly ridiculous, shambling around you in a comic, bow­legged dance, waving and rattling a strange, fur-covered talisman in your face and repeating his dissonant litany in an endless monotone. Your own instinctive powers tell you that no magic is being performed here, and you look with interest, curious to see what happens next. Suddenly the mad old Kundi falls silent. He is short of breath, his bony chest wheezing. He bares the blackened stumps of his rotten teeth, and pressing his face close to yours, so close that you can smell the stink of his fetid breath, he speaks to you.</p>

<br /><br /></div><p>‘You no look like Shianti,’ he says, looking you up and down with a theatrical gesture.</p>
<p>‘Shianti <em>wizard</em>,’ you correct, drawing no response.</p>
<p>‘You no feel like Shianti,’ Urik continues, running his leathery fingertips along the filthy, tattered remains of your robe. He wrinkles his nose. ‘You no smell like Shianti…smell more like swamp!’ he says, exploding into a great fit of hoarse laughter, clapping his hands with glee.</p>
<p>‘You see Shianti, you say?’ he then asks, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>You nod your assent.</p>
<p>‘The youngest Kundi child knows the “riddle of the Shianti”. If you have truly looked upon them, then you will know the answer.’</p>
<p>The fate of your quest hangs upon the words of a child’s nursery rhyme, it seems. Okosa, the Kundi king, agrees to grant you a guide to the Shadow Gate, only if you can answer the old Shaman’s rhyme. Anxiously, you listen to his words, burning them into your mind.</p>
<p>‘Answer me this, wizard…’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
         ‘Wise Shianti and Kundi man,<br />
         Look eye to eye in tree,<br />
         Shianti man see Kundi man,<br />
         But what does Kundi see?’<br />
        </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The solution to the rhyme can be found in part two of the Grey Star series:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[<a name="gamerulz-2-foot" href="#gamerulz-2">1</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This may leave you with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm#sect175">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm#title"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, then you use <small>ENDURANCE</small> points at a rate of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points for every 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point you lack (i.e. 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points = 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point). If your <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <small>WILLPOWER</small> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score.</p>
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-1-foot" href="#gamerulz-1">2</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <small>WILLPOWER</small> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <small>WILLPOWER</small>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p><p>[<a name="powers-1-foot" href="#powers-1">3</a>]  (<a href="#powers">Magical Powers</a>) If your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero.

The Jewelled Dagger’s bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> should only be applied when the Jewelled Dagger is used in combat. You should not use your Wizard’s Staff at the same time. This would incur the normal −6 penalty to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for not using your Wizard’s Staff.</p><p>Alternatively, you may decide that the Jewelled Dagger may be wielded together with your Wizard’s Staff, and thus confers its bonus in all close combats.
