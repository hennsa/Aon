   <p>You are the Wizard Grey Star. Your quest is to retrieve the legendary Moonstone and with its power throw down the evil Wytch-king. You must find the Shadow Gate—doorway to the magic realm where it lies hidden. When the moon is full, the Shadow Gate appears—in Desolation Valley beyond the Mountains of Morn, where you must dare <strong>The Forbidden City</strong>.</p>

   <p>The Wytch-king will try to track you down. His slaves will dog your every step—the cruel warriors of Shadaki, the phantom spirit of the Deathgaunt and the dark horror of the demon Kleasá. Only your Magical Powers and the might of your Wizard’s Staff can protect you in a terrifying adventure of madness, magic, and menace!</p>

   <p><cite>The World of Lone Wolf</cite> is an exciting adventure series in which you are the hero, you make the decisions, and you fight the combats using the unique systems included in the book.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Ian Page</strong> was born in London in 1960. Since the age of sixteen he has pursued a successful career as a singer/songwriter. With the band Secret Affair, he had a string of chart hits to his credit including <cite>Time for Action</cite> and <cite>My World</cite>. His interest in the fantastic worlds of ‘Sword and Sorcery’ dates back to his early teens, and to his love of the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien and Michael Moorcock. It was in 1979, when Joe Dever introduced him to role-playing games, that his involvement in the world of Magnamund began. He contributed greatly to the development of the southern reaches of this fantastic world, and worked closely with Joe on several other role-playing games projects that include TV and radio appearances.</p>

   <p>Ian has since re-entered the music industry with a band known as <a href="http://www.theaffair.co.uk/">The Affair</a>.</p>


      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels and editor for the World of Lone Wolf series, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Paul Bonner</strong> is the illustrator of the World of Lone Wolf series of gamebooks. His childhood love of ‘folk-tales, fairy-stories, <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, Scandinavian tales, myths, and sagas’ led Paul Bonner to spend four years at Harrow, a London art school, on an illustrating course of study.</p>

   <p>His artwork for the <cite>World of Lone Wolf</cite> series is among his earliest professional work. He subsequently started freelancing for Games Workshop and later accepted a full-time position. He worked there for a few years before moving on to produce full-colour artwork (which Games Workshop had not required from him). He moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and again began to work as a freelance illustrator.</p>

<h2><a name="coming">Of the Coming of Grey Star</a></h2>

<p>Ancient days they were when first the Shianti set foot upon the land that men call Magnamund. Long had they journeyed through the void, homeless wanderers in search of a pace to call their own. And so it was that when the Shianti first looked upon the face of the land, their hearts were raised in wonder. They saw a world of nameless mountains, untamed forests, and lands both wild and free. Here they chose to cease their wanderings and to devote themselves to the study and appreciation of this newfound land.</p>
<p>To the delight of the Shianti, the race of man first emerged at this time and they watched his early struggle towards civilization with eager concern. Like gods, the Shianti seemed to the minds of primitive men. Tall and proud, shining with a radiance that spoke of magic and arcane mystery, the Shianti moved among them and with their powers of wizardry, aided man in his development.</p>
<p>As the centuries passed, man fell to worship of the magical Shianti and the power of these wizards grew even stronger. With hungry hearts they sought to unlock the mysteries of knowledge, sending their minds into other planes of existence and strange worlds beyond the sphere of the material plane. Their foresight was now unmatched and the power of their thought was mighty indeed. It was at this time that they created the Moonstone. Woven of the very fabric of the astral plane of Daziarn, this translucent gem was the greatest achievement of Shianti wisdom. It was the binding force of all Shianti magic, containing the combined might of all their wizardry, the sum of all their knowledge. The Golden Age of the Shianti had come and the Moonstone was the instrument of their dominion throughout all Magnamund. Man stood as little more than a shadow, blinded by the shining white light of Shianti glory. But, in creating the Moonstone, the unwritten laws of nature had been transgressed. For the Moonstone, like the Shianti themselves, was something outside of man’s own world; it defied the natural order laid down by the creators of Magnamund and disrupted the balance that the gods had designed.</p>
<p>The Goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon and mother of all men, showed herself to the Shianti and spoke to them of the destiny of man: ‘The children of this world must claim their inheritance. Their time has come and they must learn to stand alone. They are lost in their worship of you and the day draws ever nearer when they will covet the power of the Moonstone.’</p>
<p>And the Shianti said: ‘Forgive us, Great Goddess, for we intended no harm. We love mankind even as you do. We have sought to do good and protect your children from harm.’</p>
<p>But Ishir replied, ‘Of this there can be no doubt, but this world is not your realm. Man must be free to pursue his destiny alone, and you must leave, for you trespass on his domain.’</p>
<p>The Shianti were filled with sorrow. They feared a return to the void and to their lonely wandering, and pleaded with Ishir that she might allow them to remain. Ishir was filled with pity for them. She spoke again, saying, ‘If you are to remain, you must obey my command. You must take a vow never to interfere with mankind’s fate. As a token of good faith you must lay aside the Moonstone, and return it to the plane where it belongs.’</p>
<p>Solemnly, the Shianti agreed. The vow was sworn before Ishir, and the Moonstone was returned to the Daziarn. The Shianti then moved south to the Isle of Lorn. They encircled their new home with a web of enchantments, magical mists, and mage winds to prevent man from ever finding their place of refuge in the Sea of Dreams. Knowledge of the Shianti faded with time, save in southern Magnamund where it became enshrined in legend, and the worship of them endured. Priests of the Shianti religion preserved their teachings and patiently awaited the day when the ‘ancient ones’ would return, bringing with them lasting peace and the blessing of a new golden age.</p>
<p>Two thousand years strode by and man advanced as Ishir had foretold. He built great cities and cultivated the land; his kingdoms rose and fell; he made war and loved and laughed and became master of his fate. But a new power was emerging in the province of Shadaki. There Shasarak the evil Wytch-king ruled. The black necromancer commanded an army of brutal soldiers and had a devoted following of men who upheld his religion of demonic worship and sacrificial rites. Devotees of the Shianti and other religious cults were persecuted in a merciless purge. Ruthlessly, the Wytch-king destroyed all his opponents and began a terrible war with the peoples of the neighbouring provinces. From the ruins of war Shasarak shaped the Shadakine Empire, subjugating whole nations to his evil rule. As the provinces fell to his might, the Shianti looked on helplessly, bound by their vow to the Goddess Ishir never to interfere in the affairs of man.</p>
<p>On the night of the crowning of Shasarak as Overlord of the Shadakine Empire, a great storm broke upon the Sea of Dreams, a storm that raged with unnatural intensity. Lashed by wind and rain, illuminated by wild lightning, the waters heaved and danced in fury to the thundering music of the storm, unchecked by even the enchantments of the Shianti. When finally the tempest died, the Shianti looked out in amazement on the shattered hull of a ship drifting towards their shore. Never before had this occurred, for the enchantments and mage winds had kept them secure from the curiosity of man by forcing him to sail close to his own land.</p>
<p>The Shianti went quickly to the ruined ship where they found only one survivor—a baby. They perceived the sudden arrival of this human child as a sign of great portent, and they conceived a plan by which they might lawfully aid mankind. They named the orphan child Grey Star, because a star is the symbol of hope in the Shianti faith, and because of the silver streak in the child’s jet-black hair. In the shadow of the wrath of the Goddess Ishir, they raised the child as one of their own and taught him their secrets. Diligently they set about their instruction, for their aim was to provide a saviour for mankind. Armed with the might of Shianti wizardry and wisdom, their hope was to create an adversary equal in power to the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki, for they realized that only with the death of Shasarak would man once more be free to determine his destiny.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Grey Star, trained in the ancient lore of a Shianti Wizard. For sixteen years you dwelt in safety on the Isle of Lorn, the hidden realm of the magical Shianti race, until Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti sent you upon a dangerous quest to save your own people, the race of man, from Shasarak, the tyrannical Wytch-king of Shadaki. Held by their ancient vow to the goddess Ishir, the Shianti are unable to leave their island and come to the aid of man themselves. As a human, no such promise prohibits you from leaving the island and you have been sent to recover the Moonstone and use its power to throw down the Wytch-king.</p>
<p>The Moonstone, an artefact possessing the combined force of all Shianti power, is hidden on the Daziarn plane, which can only be entered by finding one of its portals. You seek the Shadow Gate, but it never remains in one place for longer than a day and is invisible to human sight. For this reason you began to search for the ‘Lost Tribe of Lara,’ a race of magical, but primitive creatures called the Kundi. They possess the gift of Astral Vision, enabling them to see magic portals and gateways to other planes and dimensions. Once, the Kundi inhabited the forests of the Mountains of Lara. When Shasarak’s Shadakine army first invaded the free provinces of the south, they came by way of the Mountains of Lara, through the Morn Pass. The Shadakine armies were constantly ambushed and delayed by the Kundi as they made their way south, and the Kundi always eluded them, disappearing into the dense forest before the Shadakine could retaliate. Finally, in desperation, the Wytch-king burnt down the mountain’s forests and the Kundi were forced to flee from his wrath and disappeared. Only the vision and the guidance of a Kundi man will enable you to enter the Daziarn plane and find the Moonstone, and less than a month ago you began your search.</p>
<p>Voyaging across the Sea of Dreams, you came first to the city of Suhn, the largest port in the Shadakine Empire. There you befriended a cheerful merchant named Shan Li, a widely travelled man with a wry sense of humour. Your questions about the Lost Tribe, enemies of the Shadakine Empire, aroused much suspicion. You were taken to the dungeons of the House of Correction, the Shadakine prison of Suhn and subjected to the truthsay of Mother Magri, Shadakine Wytch and Law-giver. With the power of the Kazim Stone, she attempted to read your mind, but you were able to preserve the secret of your quest.</p>
<p>It was with the help of Tanith, a young, beautiful girl, learning the ways of wytchcraft in the service of Mother Magri, that you made your escape from the House of Correction. Her courage and intelligence were invaluable as you escaped the pursuit of the Shadakine. With Shan as your guide you eventually turned south and headed toward the region known as the Azanam, for it seemed likely that the Lost Tribe might be found there. But the vengeance of Mother Magri was not so easily avoided. Using the power of the Kazim Stone, she summoned a Kleasá, a demon shadow that feeds upon the soul and will of others, since it has no soul of its own. Neither your Magical Powers, nor the might of your Wizard’s Staff seemed able to defeat the Kleasá and it had almost destroyed you when Tanith cast a spell and called the demon against her. She was totally consumed by the Kleasá and both disappeared in flame. Her brave sacrifice saved your life.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, you and Shan continued south, entering the arid desert of the Azagad Gorge. Here, Shan fell, poisoned and consumed by a Quoku, the flying amphibian indigenous to those parts. After a desperate chase through the tunnels of a Cave Mantiz nest (giant insects that lair within the cliff) you eventually reached the jungles of the Azanam, and there, high in their towering treetop home, you found the Lost Tribe of Lara. But your arrival was met with great suspicion: the Kundi did not believe that you had been sent by the Shianti. In the house of Okosa, the Kundi King, Urik the Wise, their strange, eccentric shaman and elder of their tribe, challenged you to prove you were truly sent by the Shianti by answering a strange riddle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
       ‘Wise Shianti and Kundi man,<br />
       Look eye to eye in tree,<br />
       Shianti man see Kundi man,<br />
       But what does Kundi see?’<br />
      </p>

</blockquote>
<p>To discover the answer to the riddle and to continue your search for the Moonstone and the Shadow Gate that leads there, turn to <a href="#sect1">Section 1</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>If you have already completed <a href="../../gs/01gstw/title.htm#title"><cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite></a> (<a href="../../gs/01gstw/title.htm#title">Book 1</a> of the World of Lone Wolf series), you already have your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and your Magical Powers. In the course of your adventure your powers of wizardry have grown and so you may add 10 to your <small>WILLPOWER</small> total<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> and choose one more <a href="#powers">Magical Power</a>.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> All weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of <a href="../../gs/01gstw/title.htm#title">Book 1</a> should be entered on a fresh <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. You are now ready to begin this adventure.</p>
<p>If this is your first adventure, read on…</p>
<p>To keep a record of your adventure, use the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Before you set off on your adventure, you must discover how well your Shianti masters have prepared you for your quest by determining your fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—your state of mind—<small>WILLPOWER</small>—and your physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. To do this take a pencil and, with eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your <small>WILLPOWER</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>WILLPOWER</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have a <small>WILLPOWER</small> of 26). If you decide to use a spell or utilize the power of your Wizard’s Staff, then you will lose <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. If at any time your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you may not use any of your spells<sup><a href="#gamerulz-4-foot" name="gamerulz-4">3</a></sup> or your Wizard’s Staff.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-3-foot" name="gamerulz-3">4</a></sup> Lost <small>WILLPOWER</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, and it is possible for your <small>WILLPOWER</small> points to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p>The third number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). If you are wounded in combat, you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure but can never rise above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<h3><a name="powers">Magical Powers</a></h3>

<p>When you start your adventure, your education in the ways of wizardry is incomplete. You have mastered only <em>five</em> of the seven Magical Powers that the Shianti call the Lesser Magicks. The choice of which five Powers these are is up to you. All of the Lesser Magicks may be of use to you at some point on your quest, so choose them with care. Your survival may depend on the correct use of a Magical Power at the right time.</p>
<p>The seven Magical Powers available to you are listed below. When you have chosen your five Powers, enter them in the Magical Powers section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sorcery">Sorcery</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="122" width="386" src="sorcery.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Power allows a wizard to transform his thoughts or desires into magical energy. By concentration of the will it is possible to create magical shields of force to bar doors or move objects. Sorcery drains more <small>WILLPOWER</small> points than any other Magical Power, and is most effective when your <small>WILLPOWER</small> points are high.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Sorcery’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="enchant">Enchantment</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="130" width="386" src="enchant.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others. He will be able to extract information from others, place thoughts and compulsions into another’s mind, or cause them to believe that imaginary events are actually taking place. Some magical or highly intelligent beings may be immune to the powers of Enchantment.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Enchantment’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="elementl">Elementalism</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="118" width="386" src="elementl.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of elemental magic allows a wizard some control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth, and Water. By entering a trance and chanting incantations, you may summon aid from the spirits of the Elemental Plane. Elementals have very little understanding of man, and for this reason a wizard can never be sure of the nature of the aid the Elementals may send.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Elementalism’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="alchemy">Alchemy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="121" width="386" src="alchemy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>A wizard who possesses the Power of Alchemy is able, through the mixing of various substances, to create magical potions. Given the correct ingredients, a potion may restore lost energy (i.e. <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, <small>WILLPOWER</small>), or temporarily improve various abilities (e.g. <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>). The use of Alchemy may also allow a wizard to alter the nature of substances (e.g. change lead into gold), but the necessary ingredients and the correct equipment (e.g. a pestle and mortar) must be at hand. The use of the Power of Alchemy drains no <small>WILLPOWER</small>.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power write ‘Alchemy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="prophecy">Prophecy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="123" width="386" src="prophecy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of Prophecy allows a wizard to foretell the future through meditation. A meditative state will allow a wizard to make the correct decision when facing conflicting choices or difficult actions; to discover the whereabouts of a person he has once met, or an object he has once seen. It may also allow him to determine the true nature of a stranger or a strange object. Magical beings or objects are sometimes hidden from the Power of Prophecy.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Prophecy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psycmncy">Psychomancy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="126" width="386" src="psycmncy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Power bestows upon a wizard the ability to deduce facts about events by touching objects connected to them. Through deep concentration, a wizard may lay his hands upon any inanimate object and visualize scenes that have affected it. Visions brought about through the use of Psychomancy are often cryptic, taking the form of a riddle or puzzle. Some magic items are resistant to the use of Psychomancy and may, sometimes, impart misleading information.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Psychomancy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="evcation">Evocation</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="131" width="386" src="evcation.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Mastery of this Power permits contact with the spirit realm. A wizard wishing to speak with the dead, or to call up a form from the spirit world, must draw a magic pentacle and enter a trance, when the use of the correct spell-chant will reach out to the Spiritual Plane. Standing within the protection of a magic pentacle, a wizard may consider himself to be relatively safe from harm. If he wishes to speak with a corpse, especially one whose former life was good and righteous, then a wizard can expect help and advice. However, contact with those whose former lives were evil or selfish can be a perilous, and often fatal, experience. Evil spirits are reluctant to return to the realm of the dead and may try to trick a wizard into freeing them into the world of the living. All spirits, good and evil, will require some service of the wizard in return for their aid. Any failure to perform this task, however difficult, may result in the wizard losing his life.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Evocation’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="staff">Wizard’s Staff</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="staff.gif" /><br /><br /></div><p>Your Staff is your most valuable possession. It looks and feels like an ordinary quarterstaff, yet it is stronger than any known metal. This is your main combat weapon, for you are untrained in the use of any other form of armed combat. It contains a potent force that is unleashed at will by the power of your mind, and causes a beam of destructive power to hurtle from its tip. Every time you unleash this power you must deduct 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point.<sup><a href="#powers-1-foot" name="powers-1">5</a></sup></p>
<p>In the event that your enemy survives such an attack or should you fall victim to a surprise attack, you will be forced to engage in close combat and must attempt to strike your enemy with the Staff. If your attack is successful, a bolt of energy will be released from the Staff that is capable of inflicting great physical harm. If you wish to increase the amount of damage that you inflict in this way, you must use more <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and multiply the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by the enemy, accordingly. For example, if you chose to expend 3 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points on your attack, all enemy <small>ENDURANCE</small> point losses would be multiplied by three.</p>
<p>If you enter combat without your Staff, deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>You wear the grey robe and hooded cloak of a Shianti Wizard. Your only weapon is your Wizard’s Staff (note this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> under Weapons). You wear a Backpack containing 4 Meals (note under Meals on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>), and you have been given a <a href="#map">map of the Shadakine Empire</a> (note under Special Items on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) which you place inside your robe.</p>
<p>If you have chosen Alchemy as one of your Magical Powers, then you will have a leather pouch for herbs and potions hanging from your belt. The Herb Pouch contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 empty Vials for carrying potions</li>
<li>1 Vial containing Saltpetre</li>
<li>1 Vial containing Sulphur</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark these 4 items in your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Your Herb Pouch will carry a maximum of eight items.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You do not need to make notes, but you should refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wizard’s Staff—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Backpack—slung over the shoulder.</li>
<li>Meals—carried in the Backpack.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>. Your Wizard’s Staff counts as one weapon.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
<dt>Nobles (Shadakine currency)</dt>
<dd>These are carried in the pocket of your robe.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given Capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">6</a></sup></p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> depends on your Wizard’s Staff. If you do not possess your Staff when you enter combat you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat without a weapon, deduct 8 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember that you can only carry <em>two</em> Weapons at once.)<sup><a href="#equipmnt-2-foot" name="equipmnt-2">7</a></sup></dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember that you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at any one time.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.</dd>
<dt>Currency</dt>
<dd>The currency of the Shadakine Empire is the Noble, which is a small jade stone. The system of money is alien to the Shianti, and for this reason you begin your adventure with no money. Whenever you kill an enemy, you may take any Nobles belonging to him and keep them in the pocket of your robe.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</dd>

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Grey Star’s aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Grey Star’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total, based on the weapon you are using. (Remember, if you enter combat without your Staff, you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points.)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">If you are using your Wizard’s Staff</a>, decide how many <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you wish to use. (Remember, you must expend at least 1 point.) Enter this number on your Combat Record in the box marked <small>WILLPOWER</small>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Grey Star (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15, <small>WILLPOWER</small> 23) is ambushed by a Deathgaunt (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but he can use his Wizard’s Staff against the creature as it swoops down on him. He subtracts the Deathgaunt’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −5. (15 − 20 = −5). −5 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio. Grey Star decides to use 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, which is noted on the <small>WILLPOWER</small> box of the Combat Record.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>When you have decided upon the number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you wish to use, and you have determined your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked. (The random numbers appear on the side of the chart.) You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by Grey Star. To calculate the number lost by the enemy, multiply the number listed for the enemy by the number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points that Grey Star elected to use. Now you have the final number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Grey Star and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GS represents points lost by Grey Star.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Grey Star and the Deathgaunt has been established as −5, and Grey Star’s <small>WILLPOWER</small> points used as 2. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Grey Star loses 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>Deathgaunt loses 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, multiplied by 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, giving a total of 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in all.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat, and Grey Star’s amended <small>WILLPOWER</small> points total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Grey Star are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Grey Star is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Grey Star proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Grey Star may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>The room is silent. Okosa, the Kundi king, his servants, and Urik, the old Shaman of the Kundi tribe, look on intently as you concentrate on the strange riddle. Suddenly, the solution crystallizes in your mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
         <i>Wise Shianti and Kundi man,<br />
         Look eye to eye…</i>
        </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Of course! The eyes of the Shianti race have pupils like mirrored glass. Anyone looking into the eyes of a Shianti would see himself reflected there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
         <i>Shianti man see Kundi man<br />
         But what does Kundi see?</i>
        </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Kundi man would see <em>himself!</em></p>
<p>You give your answer. At once, the tension in the atmosphere evaporates. The expressions on the faces of the assembled Kundi men change to a mixture of awe and respect, and Urik bows low. ‘Welcome friend,’ he says, simply.</p>
<p>King Okosa steps forward and grips your hand firmly. ‘Forgive us,’ he says. ‘These troubled times…Shadakine wear many disguises. Evil have many faces. We give all help to Shianti child now we know he speak truth.’</p>
<p>You breathe a great sigh of relief, for without the aid of the Kundi your quest is doomed to failure. Only the eyes of a Kundi man are able to see the magical Shadow Gate, the door you must open before entering the realm of the Daziarn Plane where the Moonstone of the Shianti is hidden.</p>
<p>The exhaustion and fatigue of your adventure on your way to the cloud forest floods through you like a great wave that washes through your tired limbs. Before you can speak your thanks, you fall into a faint.</p>
<p>Through the haze of a dream, your senses pass from sleep to waking. Opening your eyes, you see the wrinkled face of Urik, gazing intently into your own. ‘How…how long?’ you falter.</p>
<p>‘Three days. Three nights. Deep sleep have healing ways—is true?’ Urik replies. You sit up in the hammock that has been your resting place these past three days and look around. Bright sunlight streams in through the window of the wooden chamber. The events of the past weeks rush through your mind. With some surprise, you note that your body is unmarked after the horrors of your ordeal. Even the Mantiz bite on your leg has disappeared.</p>
<p>‘Kundi magic,’ Urik explains, mysteriously. Your tattered, grey robes, washed and repaired, are laid out for you, and when you have breakfasted on fresh rainwater and honey cakes, you are led out to meet King Okosa once more. You marvel at the breathtaking beauty of the cloud forest that is the home of the Kundi people. Urik leads, shambling along with his comical, bow-legged walk and toothless smile and you cross the wooden walkways that connect the tree houses of the Kundi. They nestle amongst the highest branches of giant Azawood trees, whose towering heights and leafy peaks draw moisture from the clouds themselves: the wooden turrets of a forest castle surrounded by an ocean of cloud.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="635" width="386" src="ill1.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration I</strong>—The wooden turrets of a forest castle, surrounded by an ocean of cloud.
<br /><br /></div><p>You are brought before the Kundi king once more. He and his advisers are gathered in the largest of the tree houses and old Urik ushers you in. ‘You are well?’ the king asks. You nod your head and thank him and his people for treating you with such kindness.</p>
<p>‘Long ago,’ the king continues, ‘before Wytch-king, Shasarak, rose in the north, the Shianti and Kundi tribes—great friends. Shianti need magical sight of Kundi to look into other worlds, see other planes. Only Shianti can go there. Only Kundi can see there…We help each other. Learn many things. But when Shianti leave, Wytch-king lead Shadakine peoples against us, burning the forests of our home in Mountains of Lara. Now, Shianti send great wizard to destroy evil Wytch-king, throw down Shadakine. Kundi men give all their help, in honour of our friendship. How we aid you?’</p>
<p>‘I must travel to the Daziarn plane and reclaim the Moonstone of old,’ you reply. ‘My masters tell me that I must seek out the Shadow Gate, the doorway that is invisible to all but the eyes of the noble Kundi. I ask you for a guide to take me there.’</p>
<p>The king creases his brow. ‘Shadow Gate come and go; never in one place for long,’ says King Okosa. ‘Kundi eyes must see far; make prophecy for next place Shadow Gate appear. Only the keenest eyes among us can help you. I will name your guide.’ You search amongst the faces of those present, wondering which of the brave Kundi men will be chosen. ‘Grey Star, I give you Urik the Wise,’ says the king, with a gesture of the hand.</p>
<p>You look with some surprise at Okosa’s choice. Urik smiles back, a great toothless grin, and bows humbly. The Shaman looks far too old and frail to be able to face the likely dangers ahead, but without the ‘sight’ of the ageing Shaman, your quest is hopeless. Perhaps, you think doubtfully, he has other talents?</p>
<p>‘Waste no time. Start now,’ Urik says. ‘Urik find Shadow Gate. Wizard see some <em>Kundi</em> magic now!’ He flashes you a sly smile. Not for the first time, you get the feeling that Urik is mocking you with his jibes about magic and wizards, as if he knows some great secret that others do not.</p>
<p>‘I work a great spell,’ he announces to everyone, like an actor addressing an audience. ‘Stand back! Give me room! I must find the Shadow Gate.’ A large circle forms and you watch Urik stride to the centre, his tail lashing and eyes glaring. You watch with some curiosity as he turns around and around, slowly at first, gradually increasing speed. He breathes deeply and often, hissing as he expels each breath from his lungs. Rags and feathers flutter and the tiny bells that he is wearing ring furiously. Soon, he is shouting and gibbering like a lunatic, arms waving in the air. You are barely able to suppress a snort of laughter but quickly check yourself, noticing that the Kundi look on with sombre expressions. Suddenly, Urik gives an ear-piercing scream, ceases his crazed, whirling dance, and spins to the floor, where he collapses in a heap. Startled, you go to help him but feel a restraining hand on your arm. ‘No,’ a young Kundi man whispers. ‘It is the trance. The rite is over—the visions come.’</p>
<p>‘You mean there’s more!’ you exclaim. Indeed, the show is not yet over. Urik has been silent for a short time, save for the panting of his protesting lungs. He sits up, straight-backed and stiff-limbed, his eyes wide and staring.</p>
<p>‘I see mountains!’ he moans. ‘Black mountains! And beyond…a wide valley, dead land, ash and dust. Everywhere darkness, darkness and…I…I see it—the Shadow Gate—beneath the light of a full moon.’</p>
<p>After heated discussion, all are agreed that the black mountains of Urik’s vision must be the infamous Mountains of Morn, and the dead lands beyond, Desolation Valley, a wasted plain that lies on the other side of the mountains—the site of an ancient calamity. As Urik saw a full moon shining above the Shadow Gate, the Kundi are sure that it will appear somewhere in Desolation Valley at that time.</p>
<p>‘Already it is the time of the new moon,’ says King Okosa.</p>
<p>‘Two weeks,’ you breathe.</p>
<p>‘Two weeks, Grey Star,’ says the king, ‘and two hundred miles of Shadakine country, difficult mountains, and unknown wilderness, lie ahead. You have little time.’</p>
<p>‘What do you think, Urik?’ you say.</p>
<p>Urik’s ugly old face breaks into a knowing smile. ‘Little time…much to do!’ he says, jovially. ‘Urik have plan—cover many miles in just one day, leave Azanam far behind.’</p>
<p>‘But how?’ you ask. ‘When?’</p>
<p>‘Great wizard must learn much patience,’ he replies. ‘You will see. Be ready to leave tomorrow at first light.’ Urik will say no more and quickly leaves. You turn to the Kundi king. He merely shrugs his shoulders.</p>
<p>‘Ways of the wise are strange,’ he says, ‘and who dare question the path of wisdom?’ he finishes, cryptically. Like many Kundi sayings, it is one that begs no answer. It seems you have no choice other than to wait until tomorrow’s dawn to find out the Shaman’s plan.</p>

<p>Still within the vision, you point towards the Element of Air. It floats towards you and you feel it entering the domain of Earth. The use of this Magical Power has cost you 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points.</p>
<p>When you open your eyes, you see that the Shadakine have already reached the edge of the lake. Their leader shouts commands and they move into position, loading their weapons and preparing to fire. There is no sign of the Air Elementals.</p>
<p>The Shadakine leader gives a shout and the Shadakine warriors release a volley of crossbow bolts in your direction. Instinctively, you and Urik dive to the ground. You are dismayed; it seems that the Elementals have failed you. Then suddenly, a burst of astonished cries comes from the Shadakine as a colossal gust of wind tears past you. Looking up, you watch as the volley of quarrels is swept up and away by a whirlwind of dust and debris. The Elemental stands, man-high before you, the faint outline of a pair of eyes shining up from within the depths of its form. It is a Whirlghast, and the bolts of the Shadakine are unable to pass through it.</p>
<p>‘Urik,’ you call, ‘can we do anything about the Eijalfish?’ Another volley of bolts flies towards you, but they are spun in all directions by the Whirlghast. Urik produces a small boomerang from his tunic. Its edge is lined with a row of razor-sharp teeth. ‘I try,’ he says.</p>
<p>Taking careful aim, he throws the boomerang towards the eyestalks of the Eijalfish. His aim is true; the boomerang slices an eye from its stalk before returning to land at his feet. Green blood marks the spot where the Eijalfish once lingered. ‘We go now?’ Urik asks, a mischievous grin on his face as he bends to pick up his weapon.</p>

<p>‘Samu, he carry you here. Him big man…fierce warrior.’</p>
<p>‘How did the battle go?’ Urik tells you of the victory of the Freedom Guild and the complete rout of all Shadakine forces within the city. A small blow has been struck for freedom against Shasarak, the evil Wytch-king.</p>

<p>You give Urik a hard stare but resist the urge to snap back at him. ‘How are we going to get out of here?’ you mutter.</p>
<p>‘Who knows; start another fire perhaps?’ replies Urik, sarcastically. You turn to face Urik and begin to argue until suddenly Urik falls quiet and pales; he points behind you. You turn to see a tall shadow looming towards you out of the darkness, a huge, bloody broadsword in one hand.</p>

<p>The gap in the undergrowth that leads into the clearing is very narrow and the Shadakine can pass through only a few at a time. Three Shadakine warriors charge towards you, bellowing a savage battle-cry. To your surprise, Urik produces a small boomerang edged with razor-sharp teeth. He wields it with great skill and accuracy. With a stunned cry, the first of the Shadakine falls to the ground, his sword arm severed by Urik’s deadly weapon. Two Shadakine remain and you must fight them as one enemy.</p>

<p>Since the swamp region is an infertile place unlikely to yield food, Urik hands you enough Lianor for three Meals. Each tuber counts as one Meal and you store them in your Backpack.

You have travelled no more than a mile when, suddenly, Urik sinks into a bog. With great effort, you manage to pull him free. Another mile or so and it is you who stumbles into a bog. Fortunately, Urik acts quickly and pulls you to safety. Solemnly Urik informs you that the bogs are likely to become more frequent from now on.

Finally, the passage ends and a secret hatch opens on to the balcony of an ornate building. The balcony overlooks a vast hall where you witness a strange sight.</p>
<p>An old man in tattered ermine robes sits upon a broken throne, surrounded by a bizarre gathering of people. Two guards in rusty armour stand either side of him as the ragged assembly of mad courtiers dances a stately pavane without music.

An unnatural howl sounds from somewhere behind you; it is the chilling call of the Magdi, the monstrous two-headed hounds created by the Wytch-king Shasarak.

<p>Standing before a crumbling bridge that crosses the left-hand fork of the Belzar River, you gaze, awestruck, at the desolate city that rests beneath the shadow of the mountains. In your darkest dreams, you have never known a place so eerie and forbidding: the blackened shards of the city walls reach hauntingly into the sky; clumps of black weed grow between pieces of crumbling masonry, and the twisted heights of ancient spires and crippled towers point accusingly at the heavens; an awful gloom hangs in the air and an atmosphere of brooding menace emanates from the heart of the city.</p>

You notice how pale they look, almost sickly, and a vague disquiet stirs in the back of your mind.</p>
<p>You approach the bridge and Hugi looks at it, his eyes full of doubt. ‘Is it safe?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘It’s stood here for centuries,’ Hugi answers.</p>

<p>You are standing in a huge cavern. Eyes gleaming greedily, Hugi shoulders past you and runs headlong down the carved stone steps that lead to the cavern floor. ‘This must be the place!’ he says, excitedly. Immediately, he begins to search the chamber, scrabbling among the rocks and debris and then, with a jubilant cry, he unearths an old and rusty chest. In an instant, he has removed his wallet of thief’s tools and, with practised ease, sets about the lock. Swiftly, he masters the challenge, flicking open the lid with a hungry look. His face drops. ‘Books!’ he snarls contemptuously.</p>

At first, you throw 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point against it, but this challenge serves only to attract attention to yourself and the Shadakine Wytch immediately sends the full power of the Kazim Stone against you. The numbing blast that washes through your mind loses you 8 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, but because the Wytch has diverted the power of the Kazim Stone away from the warriors, the morale of the Shadakine is severely shaken and, with a cheer, the men of the Freedom Guild move forward to storm the fortress.</p>

You trip and fall, exhausted, but Samu sweeps you up in his strong arms.</p>

<p>Samu enters the grove of trees. Held in a headlock, and gurgling pleas for release, is a scrawny-looking man, dressed in a leather jerkin and bright scarlet breeches. Immediately you recognize him as the thief who tried to steal your money in the cavern of the Freedom Guild. ‘What are you doing here? State your purpose!’ you say, leaping to your feet. The thief lets out a long gurgle by way of reply.</p>

<p>You give Samu a nod and the brawny giant releases his grip. The thief collapses to the floor in an untidy heap, choking for breath and rubbing his bruised throat. Urik chortles with laughter. ‘Get up!’ you command.</p>
<p>The thief staggers to his feet, an indignant expression on his face as he brushes the dust from his clothes. ‘What have you got to say for yourself, thief?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘I am Hugi of Suhn,’ he says, haughtily.</p>
<p>‘Was it you who tried to rob me in Karnali?’</p>
<p>‘For that oversight I apologize, Master Wizard,’ he says, barely disguising the smirk on his hawkish face. ‘If I had known that you were bound for the Forbidden City, I would have offered my services at once.’</p>
<p>‘How came you by that information?’ you snap angrily.</p>
<p>‘I…er…listened at the door after Sado sent me out,’ he replies innocently.</p>
<p>‘Shall I kill the spy now?’ asks Samu, menacingly.</p>
<p>‘Spy?—Spy?’ Hugi chokes. ‘I am no spy. I am the greatest thief in all Karnali! What need have I for spying?’</p>
<p>‘You not very good at picking Grey Star’s pocket,’ Urik points out.</p>
<p>‘Nevertheless,’ says Hugi, testily. ‘Thief I am. Spy I am not.’</p>
<p>‘That still does not explain why you are following us. Why should the Forbidden City interest you?’</p>
<p>‘Ahhh!’ sighs Hugi, ‘the Forbidden City! Legends speak of priceless statutes—remnants of the ancient people who once lived there. But I have found none who dared go there. When I heard that you were bound for the City of the Dead, I chose to follow. Then, this great brute stepped out of nowhere and tried to strangle me to death.’</p>
<p>Samu glares at Hugi. ‘Shall I kill him now?’ bellows the giant, eagerly. Hugi steps back in alarm.</p>
<p>‘No, wait. Hugi, what do you know of our quest—whom do you serve?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘I know nothing of any quest and I serve no man but myself. All I ask is that you allow me to accompany you to the Forbidden City. I am not unskilled in my own small way,’ he sniffs, immodestly.</p>
<p>‘If he is half as good as he thinks, he could be useful,’ comments Urik.</p>
<p>‘Yes, and if he is a spy, we daren’t let him go, though I’ll not kill a man for the sake of a suspicion. You’re coming with us, Hugi.’ Broadly, the thief begins to smile. ‘And Samu, if he tries to escape…break one of his legs.’ Samu grins ferociously as Hugi’s face drops.</p>

Panting and gasping for breath, he hurls you to the safety of the river bank and slowly you crawl up the bank. The water you have swallowed has cost you 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Suddenly, Urik gives a cry: ‘Samu!’</p>
<p>You turn in time to see Samu’s flailing arms disappear beneath the surface of the water. You are stunned and dismayed. He disappears completely from sight, swept away by the waters of the poisonous Belzar River.</p>

Glowing with a sickly light, the figure of a man stands like a sinister vision, his face obscured by shadow. His grey robe is tattered and torn; his long, bony, claw-like fingers are covered by charred, black flesh. He points a crooked finger at you. ‘You will fail. Your power does not suffice. This fool’s errand is to no end.’</p>
<p>‘NO!’ you shout into the emptiness.</p>
<p>‘Turn aside, Grey Star. Turn aside. You dare not stand against me.’ The grim figure casts aside his hood and the shadow passes to a blood-red light, revealing a hideous face. Half of the face is missing and, in its place, a metal plate gives shape to the ruined visage of wasted flesh and scarred tissue. One eye is shrunken and sightless, while the other burns with the intensity of the sun. A gaze of unbearable malice focuses on your heart. ‘Desist, Wizard—or I will rend the very soul from your body.’</p>
<p>‘I will not!’ you scream into the darkness. A look of rage contorts his twisted features and the single eye burns into you. You are looking upon the face of Shasarak, Wytch-king of Shadaki, who has come to taunt and torment you as you sleep.</p>

<p>You come to the remains of an elaborate archway carved into the city wall. The gate collapsed long ago and the street beyond is bleak and deserted. You take a deep breath and start forward. You have taken one step when a voice cries out: ‘Who goes there?’</p>
<p>The head and shoulders of a bony old man pop through a window high above the shattered gate. He regards you suspiciously with wild, bloodshot eyes. His filthy, matted hair hangs down over his shoulders and he waves a broken, rusty sword. ‘Speak now!’ he continues. ‘I can’t open the gate until you tell me.’</p>

<p>Water explodes around you as you hit the lake. You career downwards, water swirling and bubbling all about you, until you hit the bottom. Fortunately, the water has slowed your descent and you survive the fall without injury.</p>
<p>Although encumbered by your Backpack and Staff, you manage to kick out strongly towards the surface, your lungs bursting for air. Emerging into the air, gasping for breath and choking, you look around for some sign of Urik. Moments later, he breaks through the surface of the water, grinning fiercely. ‘Greetings, Wizard,’ he says, spitting water and coughing, ‘you are well?’ You give a curt nod before splashing towards a sandy islet.</p>
<p>The islet is located near the centre of the lake. Dense clumps of reeds surround its dull, green waters and beyond them, you can hear the shouts of the Shadakine as they seek you out. ‘We must hide—get away from here. We’re too exposed,’ you say urgently to Urik, making to step into the water. You feel Urik’s restraining hand on your shoulder.</p>
<p>‘Wait!’ he says, pointing ahead. You follow the direction of his arm. A host of multi-coloured birds has taken off in alarm from the surface of the lake. The blur of colour draws your eye to something immediately below them that is moving straight towards you.</p>
<p>Two pale eyes on slender stalks protrude above the water, cold and emotionless, their irises no more than red slashes. ‘Eijalfish,’ says Urik. ‘Very big. Very poisonous. Very dangerous! And now, Shadakine come…is not good.’ Sure enough, you hear the sound of the Shadakine hunting party, beating at the dense foliage as they draw closer. In a few minutes, they are sure to discover you, stranded here in the middle of the lake.</p>

<p>‘What about food?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘Food?’ Urik sniffs, derisively. ‘Food grows on the land…water falls from sky…down from mountain river…only foolish man wish to carry the earth and the sky upon his back in little bag. Come now.’</p>
<p>Urik disappears through the door of your room and you have no choice but to follow. You follow Urik in the half light as he clambers along the wooden walkways of the Kundi colony. The air is warm and damp with dew and the clouds hang low above the trees of the Azanam. Already, Urik has nearly disappeared from sight in the thick mist and you struggle to match his pace as he steps nimbly from one platform to another.

<p>That night, the streets of Karnali are filled with joyous celebration. The surviving Shadakine are flushed out from their bolt-holes and imprisoned in the dungeons beneath their own fortress. It is a great victory for the brave fighters of the Freedom Guild, for at last, after many years of oppression, the people in this small corner of the Shadakine Empire are free.</p>
<p>In a chamber in the Shadakine fortress, you sit with Urik and Sado of the Long Knife, who toasts you with a huge goblet of wine. ‘To you, Grey Star,’ he says, ‘I give my thanks and good wishes. Long may you endure.’</p>
<p>But Urik sits in the corner and grumbles: ‘Much celebration. Small victory. Shadakine Empire,’ and he stretches his arms wide apart, ‘<em>big</em>!’ Then placing his thumb and forefinger together, ‘City of Karnali, small.’</p>
<p>‘Urik is right,’ you say, ‘but at least this is a beginning.’ And you smile warmly at Sado.</p>
<p>‘Where will you go now, Grey Star?’ he asks.</p>
<p>‘West, to the Mountains of Morn—and beyond.’</p>
<p>Sado gapes. ‘To “the dead lands”!’ he exclaims. ‘But this is folly. None return from there. There is a sickness on the land that kills all, and the Mountains of Morn are impassable.’</p>
<p>‘There must be some way through them,’ you say, ‘and I will find it.’</p>
<p>‘There is only one known pass,’ Sado continues, ‘but it holds the greatest peril of all—Gyanima, the Forbidden City…the City of the Dead!’ He shakes his head solemnly. ‘Will you not turn away from this reckless course?’</p>
<p>You shrug. ‘There is no other way. Urik’s vision leads to Desolation Valley and my quest takes me there.’</p>
<p>Sado falls silent and an uncomfortable quiet follows. Finally, you rise and bid Sado goodnight, for you intend to leave Karnali the following morning. ‘I had hoped you would remain, Grey Star,’ he says. ‘You are a powerful ally and I have great need of strength. Soon, the Wytch-king will seek to destroy our freedom. Without your help, our liberty may prove short-lived. Moreover, you choose a path of doom, heedless of my words of warning.’</p>
<p>‘Fear not, Sado of the Long Knife,’ you reply. ‘If I achieve my goal, there will be freedom for all ensnared by the cruel grasp of the Wytch-king. I do not intend to fail.’</p>
<p>You leave the chamber, and close the door behind you. Despite your courageous words, a creeping uncertainty is stirring in your heart. ‘Hmph!’ snorts Urik. ‘Him brave man…but have small mind.’ He places a finger to his nose. ‘Him see only this far. Young Wizard learn quickly…carry blessing of wise Shianti. You will not fail.’ You pray that the old Kundi man is right.</p>
<p>You rise the following morning and prepare to leave. Your sleep has restored to you 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point and 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point. Sado enters your chamber to bid you farewell. ‘I have come to apologize for my harsh words last night,’ he says. ‘It is not for me to question the way of Wizards. I am but a simple soldier. I have brought gifts by way of recompense.’ He lays before you the following items:</p>

<p>A crossbow bolt slices through the air. You gasp with pain as it penetrates your shoulder (lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). Urik looks up in alarm. ‘Grey Star!’ he shouts. ‘You all right?’ You grit your teeth against the pain and nod. A dark stain of blood spreads across your robe. The Ooslo bird is losing height rapidly and, before the Shadakine are able to release another bolt, you are flying low enough to jump to the ground. At Urik’s instruction you untie the vine, wincing with the pain of your wound, and fall to the ground without further injury.</p>
<p>You tumble through a vast swathe of marsh grass that grows chest-high, and stretches in all directions. Urik gets to his feet and comes to inspect your wound. Bravely, you make to withdraw the shaft that protrudes from your shoulder but Urik stays your hand. ‘No, not yet. Much bleeding if you pull the spike. We need herbs…stop bleeding…stop infection, yes?’ You nod in agreement. ‘Come follow old Kundi. Find good herbs very near.’ He moves away, his eyes searching the ground, and you follow. Soon you reach a shallow waterway that cuts through the tall marsh grass like a trail. There, Urik finds what he is looking for and sits you down beside the little stream. ‘Urik cannot find anything to stop pain but make sure wound heal. I must hurt you now—I am sorry.’</p>
<p>With a hand both swift and sure, he pulls the bolt from your shoulder; you hiss with pain. He tears away the material of your sleeve and presses his steady hand to the wound. Then, cupping his hand, he takes some water from the stream and cleans the wound. Next, to your surprise, he grabs a handful of mud from the bottom of the stream and smears it over the injury. The cool mud eases the fire in your shoulder and, as it dries, quickly staunches the bleeding. He cleans the torn shreds of your sleeve and knots them like a bandage around your shoulder. ‘Is good?’ he asks.</p>
<p>‘I thank you, Urik,’ you reply. He pats your hand, affectionately.</p>
<p>‘No need for thanks,’ he says. ‘Wise old Kundi know healing ways. Pain stop soon.’</p>
<p>Suddenly, a terrible sound reaches your ears: a moaning howl like that of an animal in pain. Urik’s face darkens and he helps you to your feet. Crouching, so that you remain hidden, you both peep across the top of the marsh grass in the direction of the sound. In a small clearing, some two hundred yards away, you see a frightened peasant—a Shadakine slave. He is struggling to control two snarling hounds who tug at the lengths of thick chain fixed to their harnesses. They are huge and fierce: each has two heads with a single horn growing at the centre of each, and outsized fangs show through their slavering jowls. ‘Master! Master!’ the slave calls to a tall Shadakine, undoubtedly the officer in charge. ‘The Magdi—they smell something.’ The tall Shadakine officer screws up his eyes; a wicked smile plays across his face.</p>

If you can break the chain at this point, you will be able to free all the slaves at a stroke. Standing by this link-pin is the Shadakine slavemaster. Fearlessly, you charge. The slavemaster’s eyes widen with surprise but he appears unshaken by your advance. He clutches at a red Gem at his neck and, as he does, his personal slave steps forward.

<p>Despite the great damage you are inflicting on the Magdi, the enraged beast refuses to die. Try as he might, Urik is of no use—his old limbs and physical weakness make him incapable of hand to hand combat. He can only watch with fear and apprehension. His concern is so great that he fails to notice the band of Shadakine warriors stealing up on you through the dense undergrowth. As a result, you are quickly overpowered by the gloating Shadakine and, at a word from their tall sour-faced captain, the Magdi obediently ceases its attack.</p>
<p>‘Not much of a catch,’ sneers the captain, ‘but good sport, eh?’ Your Staff and Backpack are taken from you and your wrists and ankles are tightly bound with leather thongs. ‘And this is a pretty toy,’ he says, weighing your Staff in his hands. ‘But tell me, who are you, boy? Speak!’ You remain silent. ‘Lost your tongue, have you? Well that can be arranged, permanently!’ He gives you a stinging blow across the face, smiling grimly. Urik struggles angrily against the restraining hands that hold him. ‘Be still “monkey-man”,’ he scowls, ‘or you’ll be tasting some of the same.’ He returns his hateful gaze to you. ‘What are you then, boy? What do you know of the Freedom Guild? You are their spy perhaps? You serve the rebel army, do you not?’</p>
<p>Still, you remain silent. You have no knowledge of the Freedom Guild he has mentioned but the thought that there exists a form of organized resistance to the evil of the Shadakine Empire is a comfort. With a look of disgust, the captain turns away. ‘The Warward, Kiro, will find out all he needs to know on our return to Karnali,’ he says threateningly, ‘and Mother Niya’s truthsay is hard to refuse.’</p>
<p>You are unable to repress a shudder as you are reminded of the truthsay of Mother Magri and her awful Kazim Stone when first you came to the traders’ city of Suhn. The Wytches of Shadaki are among the most powerful of Shasarak’s servants, upholders of his corrupt law in all the major cities of the Empire.</p>
<p>‘Move, you scum!’ the captain shouts at his men. ‘We must reach Karnali as soon as possible.’ He glances sideways at you, one eyebrow raised. ‘There’s more to this strange pair than meets the eye,’ he says under his breath.</p>
<p>You and Urik are carried by slave bearers, slung to long wooden poles like hunting trophies. Your ankles and wrists are constantly bound and you are offered the barest of scraps of food and a minimum of water.

You curse your ill-fortune, thinking that you will have to use the power of your Staff to blast a way out of your prison, but you are feeling weak and still you have to reach Desolation Valley, which is bound to hold other dangers for you. You are roused from this moody reflection by the sound of shouting voices and the noise of a struggle from above. Suddenly, the door of your prison is thrown open. Looking down on you is the broad smiling figure of Samu, bloodied broadsword in hand. ‘But how…?’ stutters Hugi.</p>
<p>‘The river carried me way downstream before I was able to resist its current,’ says Samu. ‘I’ve been looking all over for you. Fortunately, I was nearby when you were captured. I saw them bring you down into this crypt.’ He turns and slashes at a wretch who is trying to drag him away from the door. The wretch is swatted like a fly and Samu turns back to face you. ‘Come now. We must hurry.’</p>
<p>He pulls you out, each in turn, stopping to deliver a kick at two wretches who block the doorway from the crypt. ‘This way,’ he says, indicating a narrow passage that leads upwards. ‘These creatures seem reluctant to travel this passage. They will not follow us, I think.’ You run along the passage as fast as you can with Samu protecting the rear. At the end of the passage is a heavy door. Urik swings it open and charges through.</p>

<p>Hardly daring to breathe, you and Urik remain crouched within the dense marsh grass. A Shadakine warrior pauses to look around only a few yards from your hiding place. He takes a step towards you, and then gives a startled cry as he sinks into the quicksand which once held you. His cries for help alert a number of his fellow warriors who come to his aid, hurling jeers and insults at his apparent stupidity.</p>
<p>Urik gives a satisfied nod and gestures for you to follow him. With quiet, tentative steps, you move away from the clamour of the Shadakine warriors, exploiting this unexpected distraction to the full. When Urik is satisfied that you have placed a sufficient distance between you and your enemy, he motions for you to sit down. With sure hands he breaks the quarrel that is embedded in your shoulder. ‘Make no sound,’ whispers Urik, before pulling the bolt. You grit your teeth as he tugs at the shaft and ‘swallow’ the pain. A shallow stream trickles close by and he uses its waters to clean the wound. ‘There is good medicine here,’ he says, plunging his hand into the stream and withdrawing a fistful of mud, which he daubs liberally over your injury. The mud feels cool against the throbbing pain of your shoulder and, as it dries, it staunches the bleeding. You thank Urik for his aid.</p>
<p>Suddenly a chilling howl reaches your ears, sending a shiver of fear down your spine. Cautiously, Urik rises to peer along the tops of the chest-high marsh grass, searching for the source of the howl. He quickly ducks his head and turns to speak, a worried look on his face. He tells you that the Shadakine have hunting dogs and are preparing to release them. They are the Magdi: ferocious hounds with two heads—the creation of the Wytch-king Shasarak.</p>

<p>You shake your head, moulding the force of your will in an attempt to draw a <i>Shield of Sorcery</i> before you once again. ‘We must,’ says Urik, urgently. But it is too late. Before you are able to complete the Shield, a hail of bolts darkens the sky. With a gasp of pain, you expel your last breath, falling back into the murky waters of the lake, your body pierced by several crossbow bolts.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your mission end here.</p>

<p>The overwhelming cut and thrust of your attack has cleared a path to the large archway that is the only exit from the throne room. ‘Now, Grey Star!’ shouts Samu, and with Urik and Hugi between you, you run towards the archway, thrusting glancing blows at anyone who comes too close.</p>

<p>The confidence of the Shadakine is visibly shaken when your discharge of fiery magic completely incinerates a warrior. The use of your Staff has cost you 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. You are amazed, your powers seem greatly increased since last you used them. A blast as potent as the one you have just released would normally have drained a great deal of your <small>WILLPOWER</small>. You smile with grim satisfaction as the shocked Shadakine dive for cover.</p>
<p>The Shadakine officer is quickly trying to restore order as the shaken Shadakine scramble behind the cover of the tall marsh grass. He orders them to ready weapons and prepare to fire. Soon, the Shadakine will be able to bring the full force of their weapons against you. You feel that you are in a hopeless situation. The Shadakine are not short of supplies and will be content to wait out this siege. Meanwhile, you have no food and no cover.</p>

<p>The thick foliage of the marsh makes for ideal cover and the latticed network of small waterways and streams, tributaries of the Suhni River delta, are sure to confuse any tracks that you might leave. The whole verdant expanse of the Gurlu Marshes is one huge natural maze.</p>
<p>The air is thick with humidity and an abundance of insect life. Splashing through the dark mud of the stream, you struggle to maintain a fast pace, and your efforts are well rewarded.

<p>You are standing in the middle of a honeycomb made of stone. The light of the full moon streams through the holes in the surface of the plain and the maze is bright with translucent light.

<p>Heedless of the danger to yourself, you turn and fire at the Shadakine as they tramp through the marsh grass.

Large slabs of stone fall away and Samu is forced to run. But he is too late—the bridge collapses at the centre and Samu disappears.

<p>You aim a bolt of energy from your Staff at the nearest crossbowman and fire. A streak of white-hot fire slices through the air, exploding into a massive wall of flame that engulfs the howling Shadakine warrior. The man is completely incinerated and all that remains is a smoking crater in the ground. The Ooslo gives a cry of distress, soaring up into the air at high speed. Below, the Shadakine break and scatter in all directions, plunging into the tall marsh reeds that surround them.</p>

They start forward, but as they step onto the bridge, bricks and stones fall into the river at an alarming rate. ‘Stop!’ you scream, ‘or we’re all doomed!’</p>

Samu, seeing your plight, has cut the Rope with his sword, allowing himself to fall into the running water. Horrified, you watch as Samu struggles against the current.

Urik explains that you are about to enter the heart of the swamp and the danger is sure to increase. He takes you to the top of a low hill and you survey the land ahead. You have the choice of two routes. To the northwest, the land comprises a mixture of low, twisted bushes and shrubs, and further on, a jungle of gnarled, lichenous trees. The more direct route lies to the north but the land there is more perilous. Tall marsh grass abruptly gives way to a broad expanse of quagmire and bog, interspersed with squat, black trees and stagnant pools.

Uncomprehending of its power, he had used it for petty thefts and crimes, manipulating those who had earned his displeasure.</p>
<p>You gradually come to understand the true nature of the Gem. It is a transmitter of thought, a magical item capable of increasing and amplifying mental energy.

<p>‘Grey Star,’ says Urik, ‘I thought…There are others here in marsh.

They wear veils over their faces, but otherwise share no common uniform.</p>
<p>The few Shadakine guards fall into defensive positions along the road, but the swiftness of the ambush prevents them from deploying effectively. Only a few of the veiled soldiers are felled by a volley of crossbow bolts before the Shadakine are beset by their attackers. ‘Shall we?’ you ask Urik.

As the first of the Chaksu smashes down the east gate of the city, the alarm is raised and a host of Shadakine warriors pours out of the fortress to meet the peril.</p>

Wreathed in flames, he stumbles through the foliage, clawing desperately at his body before plunging into the lake to extinguish the fire. As he hits the water, the two Eijalfish dart towards him.</p>

<p>You enter a small clearing that is sheltered by a toa tree. Curled in its shade, you see a strange, reptilian creature, four feet long, with large, soft eyes that look at you pleadingly with more than a hint of human intelligence. A large wound oozes blood from its side. Urik explains that it is a young Chaksu, a much sought after beast. The adult grows to as much as ten feet in height and Chaksu hide is an expensive commodity, much in demand due to its toughness and elasticity. It is said that the wealth of the city of Karnali that stands on the edge of the Gurlu Marshes was built upon its trade in Chaksu hides and hunters frequently come to the marshes in search of their fortune.</p>

<p>‘Urik,’ you say, ‘is there anything you can do about the Eijalfish?’ He gives you a broad grin and produces a small boomerang lined with rows of tiny, razor-sharp teeth.

<p>Waist-deep in the marsh, you keep perfectly still, counting the rapid beat of your heart but not daring even to breathe. Very gradually you feel yourself sinking. Urik has fallen on solid ground, but looks completely unharmed. You look towards him, helplessly. He places a finger to his lips and slowly reaches out for your Staff which, miraculously, you have managed to retain. After what seems an eternity, he grasps the end of your Staff and begins to pull. As the shouts of the Shadakine grow fainter, Urik manages to pull you free.</p>
<p>Just as you are thinking how lucky you have been, you hear a new and ominous sound, a discordant howling that makes your blood run cold. Cautiously, you raise your head and peer along the tops of the rushes. Standing in a small clearing, some two hundred yards off, you see a frightened-looking peasant—a Shadakine slave. He is barely able to control two snarling hounds, who tug at the lengths of chain attached to their harnesses. These are no ordinary hounds: they each have two heads with a single horn protruding from each, and a pair of outsized fangs showing through their slavering jowls. Urik peers over your shoulder and swears under his breath. ‘Big trouble, Wizard,’ he mutters. ‘They catch our scent pretty soon.’</p>
<p>Suddenly the peasant calls out. ‘Master! Master!’ he cries to a tall Shadakine, undoubtedly the officer in charge. ‘The Magdi—they smell something.’ The tall Shadakine officer screws up his eyes, a wicked smile playing across his face.

The tall Shadakine captain steps forward. ‘Surrender yourself, Wizard. You cannot hope to win.’ As he speaks, the Chaksu utters a long trilling cry like a forlorn plea for help. The captain laughs scornfully, but his smug, self-satisfied expression changes to one of terrified disbelief as two large Chaksu burst out of the undergrowth, roaring with fury and searching for their lost offspring. The largest of the Chaksu, and mother of the young Chaksu you have protected, reaches out and grabs the Shadakine officer by the neck. With a deathly grip, she lifts him off the ground. His eyes bulge and his face turns purple; he is asphyxiated before she hurls him to the ground breaking his body in several places. With a triumphant howl, the Chaksu rush towards the Shadakine, who are running in all directions.

<p>The tunnel twists and turns for many miles before opening into a large cavern. You and Urik are given food and wine, and while you eat, he tells you of his army—the Freedom Guild, a rebel band resisting the rule of the Shadakine Empire.</p>
<p>‘Karnali was the last city to fall to Shasarak,’ Sado explains. ‘The spirit of unrest was never truly crushed, and so we fight on in our small way, striking blows against the Wytch-king whenever we may. Our attacks are based in the marshes, for we hope to avoid the retribution of the Warward, Kiro, against our people by making him believe that we come from outside the city. The Shadakine waste much effort patrolling the marsh, seeking to flush us out, and attention is drawn away from the city. Only our fear that the citizens of Karnali would be punished for our actions prevents us from rising up within the city walls.

<p>You nod. ‘If my quest should finally succeed and I retrieve the Moonstone, the full might of their wisdom and magic will be turned against Shasarak,’ you tell him.</p>
<p>‘How the people would rejoice to know that a Shianti walked among us once more,’ says Sado, ‘though I understand the need for secrecy. Nevertheless,’ he continues, his eyes lighting up, ‘I would ask a boon of you. Tonight, we attempt our most daring stratagem against the corrupt rule of the Shadakine. Stand with us in battle tonight; aid us if you will. With the might of a Shianti Wizard in our ranks, who knows what we could achieve!

<p>You soon realize that Urik’s eccentric, shambling gait is not due to senility, but is one that he has adapted to suit his environment: his bow legs, the rolling rhythm of his stride, and his long tail enable him to trot along the narrowest of branches with ease. Meanwhile, you are left tottering along, your back bent in a curious balancing act, and your eyes averted from the ground, far below.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, you have reached the edge of the rain forest of the Azanam and are overlooking the Azagad Gorge. Far below, you can make out the sharp pinnacles of rock known as the ‘Dragon’s Teeth’ which cover the canyon floor. It was through this gorge that you came in search of the Azanam, and the lost Kundi tribe. There it was that your friend and guide, Shan Li the merchant, died so terribly, devoured by poisonous Quoku, the flying amphibians that inhabit the desolate land. Your silent reverie is interrupted by the sound of Urik calling to you from above. ‘Azagad hold sad memories for Grey Star?’ he enquires sympathetically. You nod your head, not thinking to ask how he knew what was on your mind. ‘No time for sorrow now…time fly! Catch.’ He throws you a length of vine cut from the tree on which he stands. You take up the creeper and look at it in puzzlement. ‘Make yourself a harness and tie it on—good and tight,’ he orders. You do as he suggests and before you can question his purpose, he produces a carved flute. He places it to his lips and begins to play a strange melody quite unlike any music you have ever heard before.</p>
<p>The music lasts for some time. Eventually, Urik puts down his pipe and looks expectantly at the sky. ‘What now?’ you ask, a hint of cynicism in your voice.</p>
<p>‘Look…see!’ he replies. Far away you can see a tiny speck on the skyline. ‘Ooslo bird…love Kundi music.’ The dark speck grows larger and soon you are able to make out the awkward, disproportionate shape of an Ooslo bird. Long-necked and small bodied, the bird’s great wings flap without rhythm or grace. It is a strange creature.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="609" width="386" src="ill16.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration XVI</strong>—You make out the awkward shape of an Ooslo bird, a strange creature.
<br /><br /></div><p>As the bird draws nearer, Urik takes up his pipe once more and plays. Eventually, the bird settles on a nearby branch, craning its neck and twisting its head, an expression of rapt fascination in its big, saucer-like eyes. Urik ties the other end of the vine into a lasso. He stops playing and, with amazing accuracy, throws the lasso over the Ooslo’s head. As the loop of the vine falls and tightens around the bird’s neck, it gives a squawk of alarm. Only now does the nature of Urik’s plan to ‘cover many miles in just one day’ dawn on you.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you are dragged up into the air by the Ooslo bird. Urik gives an excited whoop of delight, leaping into the air and grabbing at your legs, dangling there as the bird flies higher. ‘What do we do now?’ you shout, swinging wildly in the air, the old Kundi man clinging to your legs and grinning maniacally.</p>
<p>‘Ooslo bird fly home now…back to Gurlu Marshes. Ooslo—strong flier. Take us far…and good fun, eh?’ The Ooslo bird squawks loudly and Urik hoots back with a howl of wild laughter.</p>
<p>Despite the discomfort of the vine that chafes under your arms and the dizzying heights of your aerial journey away from the Azanam, you finally admit to yourself that Urik’s dangerous and eccentric plan has saved you many miles of walking and perhaps days of wandering. Far below, the landscape rushes by and by late afternoon the scenery has completely changed. Ahead lie the marshy wastes of the Gurlu swamplands, the nesting place of the Ooslo bird.</p>
<p>The Ooslo bird begins to fly lower, its voluminous wings flapping erratically as it checks its speed. You are wondering how you are to land safely when Urik shouts up to you. He is pointing ahead. ‘Big trouble. Hunters,’ he says. Sure enough, you can see a party of men armed with crossbows. With horror, you recognize the party to be comprised of Shadakine warriors, soldier slaves of the Wytch-king, Shasarak. It is evident that you have been spotted, as the warriors are running this way and that, shouting and busily priming their weapons. The ground speeds by over twenty feet below.</p>

Along the Great Suhn Road that leads east away from Karnali, you see a long line of men, women, and children: slaves of the Shadakine. Warriors walk up and down the line, brandishing flails with needless ferocity. Suddenly, the charge is sounded and a wave of men pours out of the brush and runs towards the column of slaves.</p>

<p>It is dawn and you are sweating with a fever (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>You wake your companions and begin your journey without delay, your heart still quaking with fear. Your leaden feet carry you through the fields of dust and the grim monotony of the landscape dampens your spirits. Your companions eye you with concern. When you stumble and fall with weariness, they lift you to your feet and you are comforted a little.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hugi gives a cry of alarm and you spin round. You gasp with fear as you see three Deathgaunts drifting after you, their arms outstretched in a sinister greeting, as if you were already one of their kind. You hear their evil voices whispering insidiously in your mind. ‘Go no further—only doom awaits you,’ they chant.</p>

<p>With your heart pounding you scamper across the bridge; a slight tremor runs through the stone. ‘I think it’s starting to go!’ you shout across to Samu.</p>
<p>Gingerly, he starts to cross but as he reaches the middle of the bridge, the stone cracks and, abruptly, Samu disappears from view. You rush to the edge of the collapsing bridge and look down into the water. Briefly, you see a pair of flailing arms as Samu struggles valiantly against the fast current, and then he is gone. The bridge continues to crumble but, unheeding, you stare at the black water, your eyes blurred with tears.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star!’ Urik shouts. ‘Come away…the bridge!’ Heedless of its fragile state, you walk slowly from the bridge, too numb to speak. Without looking back, the three of you walk towards the gate of the Forbidden City in silence.</p>

The shining being is a Deathgaunt, an undead spirit raised by Shasarak to roam the realm of the living. As you begin to chant the warding words of Evocation, the creature hesitates, and then stops, hanging as if suspended just above the ground.

<p>Taking a deep breath, you plunge into the water. Urik follows directly after. Hampered by your Staff and Backpack you make slow progress and soon your lungs feel ready to burst but you cannot surface for air. You must discard your Backpack to avoid drowning. (Remember to cross this item and all its contents from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>Freed of the encumbrance of your Backpack, you kick out and soon reach the edge of the lake. You break the surface, gulping at the air as you scramble away from the flame. As you cross from the water to the land, you suffer mild burns on the exposed flesh of your hands (lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point).</p>
<p>Injured and exhausted, you throw yourself into the haven of tall marsh grass. Urik staggers to your side, water cascading from his sodden clothes. You lie still for a while to regain your breath; then suddenly a chilling howl freezes your blood. Urik cocks his head to one side, and then wearily clambers to his feet. ‘They have hunting dogs,’ he says, urgently. ‘One…maybe two terrible Magdi Hounds.’ He points to a shallow waterway that disappears through the tall grass like a trail. ‘We move now—slow and silent. Keep to water. Hide scent. Come.’</p>
<p>You both creep away, stepping tentatively along the channel between the reeds as a knot of fear rises in your stomach.</p>

<p>It is a sleep that gives you no rest. Through a dark haze, the ghastly figure of Shasarak appears. ‘And still you persist—fool!’ he spits. ‘I see that my friends were unable to make you see the error of your ways,’ he says, scornfully. ‘Perhaps this will better persuade you.’</p>

It is Tanith, the Wytch girl who helped you escape from a Shadakine prison in the Port of Suhn and finally leapt to her death to save you. Now, trapped upon another plane, she weeps alone, her eyes wild with fear. ‘Tanith!’ you call into the void of your dream.</p>
<p>Shasarak laughs, savagely. ‘She cannot hear you, Wizard. No one can hear her now. She is mine to torment as and when I wish. And my imagination knows no limit in the matter of torment—in that field I rule supreme.’ The Wytch-king begins to laugh with malicious glee, relishing Tanith’s plight and your misery at witnessing it. ‘Turn aside, Grey Star, or she is lost.’ With the howl of Shasarak’s mocking laughter ringing in your ears, you wake with a start. You have lost 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point and 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point during the night.</p>
<p>In the grey light of dawn you trudge towards the Forbidden City, your companions walking silently by your side. Soon, you are able to see the outline of the city in the distance.

You may also choose to add the 10 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point bonus to this new score.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use your original <small>WILLPOWER</small> score from the beginning of <cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite>, and add 10 bonus points to this.</p>
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-2-foot" href="#gamerulz-2">2</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) If you choose Alchemy as your new Magical Power, you also receive a Herb Pouch with contents, as detailed in the <a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a> section.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-4-foot" href="#gamerulz-4">3</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This may leave you with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm#sect175">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm#title"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, then you use <small>ENDURANCE</small> points at a rate of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points for every 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point you lack (i.e. 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points = 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point). If your <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <small>WILLPOWER</small> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score.</p>
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-3-foot" href="#gamerulz-3">4</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <small>WILLPOWER</small> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <small>WILLPOWER</small>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p><p>[<a name="powers-1-foot" href="#powers-1">5</a>]  (<a href="#powers">Magical Powers</a>) If your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero.

<h4><a name="lic-1-5">1.5</a></h4>

<p>‘Licensee’ shall hereafter refer to any person or electronic agent who receives some portion or all of the Internet Editions. The ‘Licensee’ shall hereinafter be referred to as ‘Licensee’ or ‘you’.</p>

<h3><a name="lic-2">2. Terms of Distribution</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-2-0">2.0</a></h4>

<h4><a name="lic-2-1">2.1</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document. Indeed, you have no right to receive or view a copy or copies without first accepting this License as legally valid and binding and agreeing to the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>
<p>Redistribution includes but is not limited to displaying the Internet Editions within the graphical representation of an Internet site other than the Distribution Point. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the use of HTML ‘frames’.</p>
<p>An exception to the restrictions on redistribution in this section is made in that you may send the Internet Editions or derivative works thereof to the Distribution Point by the consent of the Maintainer.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-4">2.3</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators retain all other rights to their respective portions of the Internet Editions not covered by this License.

<h4><a name="lic-2-5">2.4</a></h4>

<p>If a person is under the legal age to be able to enter into a contractual relationship as defined by the laws of the area in which that person resides, they may have a parent or legal guardian agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License. On condition of agreeing to be bound by the terms of the License, that same parent or legal guardian may thereafter give a copy or copies of the Internet Editions to that child. That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

<p>If any of the Authors or the Illustrators revokes your rights granted under this License, you agree to destroy all copies of the Authors’ or Illustrators’ work which is a part of the Internet Editions of which you have control within fourteen calendar days of receiving notification in any form.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-4">4. Jurisdiction</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-4-0">4.0</a></h4>

<p>If, in consequence of court judgement or the laws of a particular area, any portion of the License is held as invalid or unenforceable in any particular circumstance, you are no longer granted any rights under the terms of this License in that circumstance. You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-5">5. Revision of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-5-0">5.0</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and the Illustrators may publish revisions of this License in the future to address new concerns. Any further revisions will be legally binding at the time that you receive notification in any form of the revision.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

<h4><a name="lic-6-1">6.1</a></h4>

<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR MAINTAINER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE INTERNET EDITIONS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE INTERNET EDITIONS TO OPERATE WITH ANY PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
