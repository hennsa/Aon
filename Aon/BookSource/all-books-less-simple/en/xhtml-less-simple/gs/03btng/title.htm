 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>You are the Wizard Grey Star, chosen hero of an ancient magical race—the Shianti. To find the Moonstone, source of all Shianti wisdom, you must venture <strong>Beyond the Nightmare Gate</strong>.</p>

   <p>Dare you enter a realm of mystery, a world of gods and demons? For somewhere in this twilight region is the secret of the Moonstone. Only you can find it and with its power throw down the evil Shasarak and save mankind. Your journey will take you across the grey plains of the Neverness, past the dark enchantments of the Crystal Tower, and on towards perils undreamed of. Armed only with the Wizard’s Staff and the magical spells of the Shianti, you must step into a nightmare world where only the bravest will survive!</p>

   <p><cite>The World of Lone Wolf</cite> is an exciting adventure series in which you are the hero, you make the decisions, and you fight the combats using the unique systems included in the book.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Ian Page</strong> was born in London in 1960. Since the age of sixteen he has pursued a successful career as a singer/songwriter. With the band Secret Affair, he had a string of chart hits to his credit including <cite>Time for Action</cite> and <cite>My World</cite>. His interest in the fantastic worlds of ‘Sword and Sorcery’ dates back to his early teens, and to his love of the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien and Michael Moorcock. It was in 1979, when Joe Dever introduced him to role-playing games, that his involvement in the world of Magnamund began. He contributed greatly to the development of the southern reaches of this fantastic world, and worked closely with Joe on several other role-playing games projects that include TV and radio appearances.</p>

   <p>Ian has since re-entered the music industry with a band known as <a href="http://www.theaffair.co.uk/">The Affair</a>.</p>


      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels and editor for the World of Lone Wolf series, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Paul Bonner</strong> is the illustrator of the World of Lone Wolf series of gamebooks. His childhood love of ‘folk-tales, fairy-stories, <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, Scandinavian tales, myths, and sagas’ led Paul Bonner to spend four years at Harrow, a London art school, on an illustrating course of study.</p>

   <p>His artwork for the <cite>World of Lone Wolf</cite> series is among his earliest professional work. He subsequently started freelancing for Games Workshop and later accepted a full-time position. He worked there for a few years before moving on to produce full-colour artwork (which Games Workshop had not required from him). He moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and again began to work as a freelance illustrator.</p>

<h2><a name="coming">Of the Coming of Grey Star</a></h2>

<p>Ancient days they were when first the Shianti set foot upon the land that men call Magnamund. Long had they journeyed through the void, homeless wanderers in search of a place to call their own. And so it was that when the Shianti first looked upon the face of the land, their hearts were raised in wonder. They saw a world of nameless mountains, untamed forests, and lands both wild and free. Here they chose to cease their wanderings and to devote themselves to the study and appreciation of this newfound land.</p>
<p>To the delight of the Shianti, the race of man first emerged at this time and they watched his early struggle towards civilization with eager concern. Like gods, the Shianti seemed to the minds of primitive men. Tall and proud, shining with a radiance that spoke of magic and arcane mystery, the Shianti moved among them and with their powers of wizardry, aided man in his development.</p>
<p>As the centuries passed, man fell to worship of the magical Shianti and the power of these wizards grew even stronger. With hungry hearts they sought to unlock the mysteries of knowledge, sending their minds into other planes of existence and strange worlds beyond the sphere of the material plane. Their foresight was now unmatched and the power of their thought was mighty indeed. It was at this time that they created the Moonstone. Woven of the very fabric of the astral plane of Daziarn, this translucent gem was the greatest achievement of Shianti wisdom. It was the binding force of all Shianti magic, containing the combined might of all their wizardry, the sum of all their knowledge. The Golden Age of the Shianti had come and the Moonstone was the instrument of their dominion throughout all Magnamund. Man stood as little more than a shadow, blinded by the shining white light of Shianti glory. But, in creating the Moonstone, the unwritten laws of nature had been transgressed. For the Moonstone, like the Shianti themselves, was something outside of man’s own world; it defied the natural order laid down by the creators of Magnamund and disrupted the balance that the gods had designed.</p>
<p>The Goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon and mother of all men, showed herself to the Shianti and spoke to them of the destiny of man: ‘The children of this world must claim their inheritance. Their time has come and they must learn to stand alone. They are lost in their worship of you and the day draws ever nearer when they will covet the power of the Moonstone.’</p>
<p>And the Shianti said: ‘Forgive us, Great Goddess, for we intended no harm. We love mankind even as you do. We have sought to do good and protect your children from harm.’</p>
<p>But Ishir replied, ‘Of this there can be no doubt, but this world is not your realm. Man must be free to pursue his destiny alone, and you must leave, for you trespass on his domain.’</p>
<p>The Shianti were filled with sorrow. They feared a return to the void and to their lonely wandering, and pleaded with Ishir that she might allow them to remain. Ishir was filled with pity for them. She spoke again, saying, ‘If you are to remain, you must obey my command. You must take a vow never to interfere with mankind’s fate. As a token of good faith you must lay aside the Moonstone, and return it to the plane where it belongs.’</p>
<p>Solemnly, the Shianti agreed. The vow was sworn before Ishir, and the Moonstone was returned to the Daziarn. The Shianti then moved south to the Isle of Lorn. They encircled their new home with a web of enchantments, magical mists, and mage winds to prevent man from ever finding their place of refuge in the Sea of Dreams. Knowledge of the Shianti faded with time, save in southern Magnamund where it became enshrined in legend, and the worship of them endured. Priests of the Shianti religion preserved their teachings and patiently awaited the day when the ‘ancient ones’ would return, bringing with them lasting peace and the blessing of a new golden age.</p>
<p>Two thousand years strode by and man advanced as Ishir had foretold. He built great cities and cultivated the land; his kingdoms rose and fell; he made war and loved and laughed and became master of his fate. But a new power was emerging in the province of Shadaki. There Shasarak the evil Wytch-king ruled. The black necromancer commanded an army of brutal soldiers and had a devoted following of men who upheld his religion of demonic worship and sacrificial rites. Devotees of the Shianti and other religious cults were persecuted in a merciless purge. Ruthlessly, the Wytch-king destroyed all his opponents and began a terrible war with the peoples of the neighbouring provinces. From the ruins of war Shasarak shaped the Shadakine Empire, subjugating whole nations to his evil rule. As the provinces fell to his might, the Shianti looked on helplessly, bound by their vow to the Goddess Ishir never to interfere in the affairs of man.</p>
<p>On the night of the crowning of Shasarak as Overlord of the Shadakine Empire, a great storm broke upon the Sea of Dreams, a storm that raged with unnatural intensity. Lashed by wind and rain, illuminated by wild lightning, the waters heaved and danced in fury to the thundering music of the storm, unchecked by even the enchantments of the Shianti. When finally the tempest died, the Shianti looked out in amazement on the shattered hull of a ship drifting towards their shore. Never before had this occurred, for the enchantments and mage winds had kept them secure from the curiosity of man by forcing him to sail close to his own land.</p>
<p>The Shianti went quickly to the ruined ship where they found only one survivor—a baby. They perceived the sudden arrival of this human child as a sign of great portent, and they conceived a plan by which they might lawfully aid mankind. They named the orphan child Grey Star, because a star is the symbol of hope in the Shianti faith, and because of the silver streak in the child’s jet-black hair. In the shadow of the wrath of the Goddess Ishir, they raised the child as one of their own and taught him their secrets. Diligently they set about their instruction, for their aim was to provide a saviour for mankind. Armed with the might of Shianti wizardry and wisdom, their hope was to create an adversary equal in power to the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki, for they realized that only with the death of Shasarak would man once more be free to determine his destiny.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Grey Star, trained in the ancient lore of a Shianti Wizard. For sixteen years you have dwelt in safety on the Isle of Lorn, the hidden realm of the magical Shianti race, until Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, decides to send you upon a dangerous quest: to save your own people, the race of man, from the tyrannical Wytch-king of Shadaki, Shasarak. Held by their ancient vow to the goddess Ishir, the Shianti are unable to leave their island either to come to the direct aid of man or to retrieve the Moonstone, which possesses the combined forces of all Shianti powers and lies hidden on another plane. As a human, no vow prohibits you from leaving the island and you have been sent to recover the Moonstone and commanded to use its power to defeat the Wytch-king. The Moonstone is hidden on the Daziarn Plane, which can be entered only by finding one of its portals.</p>
<p>Your quest begins with the search for the Shadow Gate, a doorway to the Daziarn that never remains in one place for longer than a day and is invisible to the human eye. To help you find the Shadow Gate you first seek the Lost Tribe of Lara, a race of magical but primitive creatures called the Kundi, who possess the gift of astral vision, enabling them to see the gateways to other worlds and dimensions.</p>
<p>On first arriving at the Port of Suhn, the major trading port of the Shadakine Empire, you are befriended by Shan Li, a merchant who serves as your guide through these strange and foreign lands. A short while after, you are captured and imprisoned in the House of Correction, the prison of Suhn and citadel of Mother Magri, a Wytch in the service of Shasarak. Tanith, a young girl learning the ways of wytchcraft comes to your rescue. She helps you escape from the dungeons of Mother Magri and later sacrifices herself, calling the shadow demon, the Kleasá, against her to save you from its attack.</p>
<p>After many more adventures you come, at last, to the Azanam, the treetop home of the Kundi. They give you Urik the Wise, an old Kundi Shaman, to guide you to the Shadow Gate. The two of you cross the dangerous lands of the Shadakine Empire, pursuing Urik’s vision which leads you, finally, to the Forbidden City of Gyanima in the Mountains of Morn. Beyond is Desolation Valley and there you find the Shadow Gate. However, it is guarded by one of Shasarak’s many slaves, a demon Kleasá; in fact the very Kleasá that captured Tanith, who stands in the Gateway, eternal prisoner of Shasarak unless you can free her. Finally you discover a way of releasing the Kleasá and opening the Gate.</p>
<p>Bidding farewell to Urik, you prepare to enter the Gate.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>To keep a record of your adventure, use the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Before you set off on your adventure, you must discover how well your Shianti masters have prepared you for your quest by determining your fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—your state of mind—<small>WILLPOWER</small>—and your physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> To do this take a pencil and, with eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your <small>WILLPOWER</small>. Add 20 to this number if this is your first <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure, 25 if you have completed book one successfully, 30 if you have also completed <a href="../../gs/02tfc/title.htm#title">Book Two</a>.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> Write the total in the <small>WILLPOWER</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and this is your first adventure, you would have a <small>WILLPOWER</small> of 26). If you decide to use a spell or utilize the power of your Wizard’s Staff, then you will lose <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. If at any time your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you may not use any of your spells<sup><a href="#gamerulz-4-foot" name="gamerulz-4">3</a></sup> or your Wizard’s Staff.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-3-foot" name="gamerulz-3">4</a></sup> Lost <small>WILLPOWER</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, and it is possible for your <small>WILLPOWER</small> points to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p>The third number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). If you are wounded in combat, you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure but can never rise above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<h3><a name="powers">Magical Powers</a></h3>

<p>If this is your first <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure, your education in the ways of wizardry is incomplete: you have mastered only five of the seven Magical Powers that the Shianti call the Lesser Magicks. The choice of which five Powers these are is up to you. If you have completed either books one or two or both of the <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures, you may choose six of the seven Magical Powers.<sup><a href="#powers-1-foot" name="powers-1">5</a></sup> All of the Lesser Magicks may be of use to you at some point on your quest, so choose them with care. Your survival may depend on the correct use of a Magical Power at the right time.</p>
<p>The seven Magical Powers available to you are listed below. When you have chosen your five or six Powers, enter them in the Magical Powers section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sorcery">Sorcery</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="122" width="386" src="sorcery.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Power allows a wizard to transform his thoughts or desires into magical energy. By concentration of the will it is possible to create magical shields of force to bar doors or move objects. Sorcery drains more <small>WILLPOWER</small> points than any other Magical Power, and is most effective when your <small>WILLPOWER</small> points are high.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Sorcery’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="enchant">Enchantment</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="130" width="386" src="enchant.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others. He will be able to extract information from others, place thoughts and compulsions into another’s mind, or cause them to believe that imaginary events are actually taking place. Some magical or highly intelligent beings may be immune to the powers of Enchantment.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Enchantment’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="elementl">Elementalism</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="118" width="386" src="elementl.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of elemental magic allows a wizard some control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth, and Water. By entering a trance and chanting incantations, you may summon aid from the spirits of the Elemental Plane. Elementals have very little understanding of man, and for this reason a wizard can never be sure of the nature of the aid the Elementals may send.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Elementalism’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="alchemy">Alchemy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="121" width="386" src="alchemy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>A wizard who possesses the Power of Alchemy is able, through the mixing of various substances, to create magical potions. Given the correct ingredients, a potion may restore lost energy (i.e. <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, <small>WILLPOWER</small>), or temporarily improve various abilities (e.g. <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>). The use of Alchemy may also allow a wizard to alter the nature of substances (e.g. change lead into gold), but the necessary ingredients and the correct equipment (e.g. a pestle and mortar) must be at hand. The use of the Power of Alchemy drains no <small>WILLPOWER</small>.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power write ‘Alchemy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="prophecy">Prophecy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="123" width="386" src="prophecy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of Prophecy allows a wizard to foretell the future through meditation. A meditative state will allow a wizard to make the correct decision when facing conflicting choices or difficult actions; to discover the whereabouts of a person he has once met, or an object he has once seen. It may also allow him to determine the true nature of a stranger or a strange object. Magical beings or objects are sometimes hidden from the Power of Prophecy.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Prophecy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psycmncy">Psychomancy</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="126" width="386" src="psycmncy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Power bestows upon a wizard the ability to deduce facts about events by touching objects connected to them. Through deep concentration, a wizard may lay his hands upon any inanimate object and visualize scenes that have affected it. Visions brought about through the use of Psychomancy are often cryptic, taking the form of a riddle or puzzle. Some magic items are resistant to the use of Psychomancy and may, sometimes, impart misleading information.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Psychomancy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="evcation">Evocation</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="131" width="386" src="evcation.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Mastery of this Power permits contact with the spirit realm. A wizard wishing to speak with the dead, or to call up a form from the spirit world, must draw a magic pentacle and enter a trance, when the use of the correct spell-chant will reach out to the Spiritual Plane. Standing within the protection of a magic pentacle, a wizard may consider himself to be relatively safe from harm. If he wishes to speak with a corpse, especially one whose former life was good and righteous, then a wizard can expect help and advice. However, contact with those whose former lives were evil or selfish can be a perilous, and often fatal, experience. Evil spirits are reluctant to return to the realm of the dead and may try to trick a wizard into freeing them into the world of the living. All spirits, good and evil, will require some service of the wizard in return for their aid. Any failure to perform this task, however difficult may result in the wizard losing his life.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Evocation’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="staff">Wizard’s Staff</a></h4>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="staff.gif" /><br /><br /></div><p>Your Staff is your most valuable possession. It looks and feels like an ordinary quarterstaff, yet it is stronger than any known metal. This is your main combat weapon, for you are untrained in the use of any other form of armed combat. It contains a potent force that is unleashed at will by the power of your mind, and causes a beam of destructive power to hurtle from its tip. Every time you unleash this power you must deduct 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point.<sup><a href="#powers-2-foot" name="powers-2">6</a></sup></p>
<p>In the event that your enemy survives such an attack or should you fall victim to a surprise attack, you will be forced to engage in close combat and must attempt to strike your enemy with the Staff. If your attack is successful, a bolt of energy will be released from the Staff that is capable of inflicting great physical harm. If you wish to increase the amount of damage that you inflict in this way, you must use more <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and multiply the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by the enemy, accordingly. For example, if you chose to expend 3 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points on your attack, all enemy <small>ENDURANCE</small> point losses would be multiplied by three.</p>
<p>If you enter combat without your Staff, deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>You wear the grey robe and hooded cloak of a Shianti Wizard. Your only weapon is your Wizard’s Staff (note this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> under Weapons). You wear a Backpack containing 4 Meals (note under Meals on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>), and you have been given a <a href="#map">map of the Shadakine Empire</a> (note under Special Items on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>), which you place inside your robe.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">7</a></sup></p>
<p>If you have chosen Alchemy as one of your Magical Powers, then you will have a leather pouch for herbs and potions hanging from your belt. The Herb Pouch contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 empty Vials for carrying potions</li>

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Grey Star’s aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Grey Star’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total, based on the weapon you are using. (Remember, if you enter combat without your Staff, you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points.)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">If you are using your Wizard’s Staff</a>, decide how many <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you wish to use. (Remember, you must expend at least 1 point.) Enter this number on your Combat Record in the box marked <small>WILLPOWER</small>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Grey Star (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15, <small>WILLPOWER</small> 23) is ambushed by a Deathgaunt (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but he can use his Wizard’s Staff against the creature as it swoops down on him. He subtracts the Deathgaunt’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −5. (15 − 20 = −5). −5 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio. Grey Star decides to use 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, which is noted on the <small>WILLPOWER</small> box of the Combat Record.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>When you have decided upon the number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you wish to use and have determined your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked. (The random numbers appear on the side of the chart.) You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by Grey Star. To calculate the number lost by the enemy, multiply the number listed for the enemy by the number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points that Grey Star elected to use. Now you have the final number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Grey Star and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GS represents points lost by Grey Star.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Grey Star and the Deathgaunt has been established as −5, and Grey Star’s <small>WILLPOWER</small> points used as 2. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Grey Star loses 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>Deathgaunt loses 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, multiplied by 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, giving a total of 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in all.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat, and Grey Star’s amended <small>WILLPOWER</small> points total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Grey Star are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Grey Star is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Grey Star proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Grey Star may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="sage">Sage Advice</a></h2>

<p>You are about to begin a quest of utmost importance and terrible danger. Beware, for you enter a world quite different from the one you leave behind. Here, even the natural laws are strange and you will need all your wits and cunning to survive in this alien world.</p>
<p>You will find items that might be of assistance. Some Special Items will help you on your quest, others may be of no use at all. You must decide what to keep.</p>
<p>Be cautious in your use of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, as your <small>WILLPOWER</small> is the energy source for your Magical Powers and your Wizard’s Staff. A <small>WILLPOWER</small> score of zero or below will leave you weak and vulnerable to attack, unable to offer effective resistance.</p>

<p>Tanith takes you by the hand and you step forward into a tunnel of swirling mist. As the outline of the Shadow Gate fades behind you, you gaze at your new surroundings. Horrified, you perceive strange shapes and pale faces writhing within the tunnel wall. The faces stare at you vacantly, mouthing indistinguishable words, and you walk along the tunnel to a barrage of murmuring voices, muffled cries, moaning, and sobbing. Tanith looks at you but says nothing, the terror in her eyes mirroring your own. ‘Such a place could drive a man insane,’ you say, quietly.</p>
<p>The two of you walk faster into the unknown, your hearts pounding with anticipation. Finally, the tunnel opens on to a vast plain of white cloud suspended beneath a sunless sky. Stepping onto this twilit plain, you notice that the light of the sky casts no shadow and disappears into absolute blackness above your head. Looking down, you can see no solid ground beneath the cloud, which somehow supports you. Like the Shadow Gate before, the tunnel of mists fades away and you find yourself staring out across the bleak silence of the Daziarn. Scanning the distant horizon, you sight the outline of a building. Tanith tugs your arm. ‘Look!’ she says, pointing away to the left. You follow the direction of her outstretched arm to see the hunched figure of a man, gliding slowly across the plain.</p>

<p>Tanith takes a step towards Drear, her mind bewitched by his enchantment. You resist the power of his call, using the strength of your will but you expend 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points before Drear’s spell is completely banished from your mind.</p>
<p>With an anguished cry, Drear suddenly vanishes and Tanith regains her senses with a start. ‘I was almost his to command,’ she comments, breathless and frightened.</p>
<p>‘Come,’ you reply, ‘to the Crystal Tower. We are sure to learn something of the Moonstone there.’</p>

<p>Carefully you set down the heavy statue and a sigh of relief escapes the Elessi’s lips. <i>I am the Guardian of the Screaming God,</i> he says in a clear, musical tone. <i>Before you continue this madness, let me tell you of that which you seek to steal.</i></p>

<p>You find Oz-na-Mun sitting before his shack, staring at a tall mass of moist, red clay before him. His gaunt face is full of sorrow and he does not even look up when you approach. ‘So you have come,’ he says, flatly.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="643" width="386" src="ill1.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration I</strong>—Oz-na-Mun is sitting before his shack, staring at a mass of red clay.
<br /><br /></div><p>‘You knew I was coming?’ you reply, surprised.</p>
<p>‘He has been here; your shadow brother, your dark self. There was a girl with him also.’</p>
<p>‘I seek the Moonstone of the Shianti,’ you state. ‘Do you know where it is and how it may be found?’</p>
<p>The sad-eyed man looks at you solemnly. ‘There is a mountain, the Moaning Mountain it is called. In the side of the mountain is a cavern and at the end of the cavern is a Gate from this realm to the next, a place known as the Vale of Peace. The people of the Vale are wise and friendly; they will show you the way to the hidden realm of the Moonstone. Here, take this map of the Moaning Mountain.’ He gives you a cloth map showing the location of the cavern. Mark this as a Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> and carry it in a small pocket inside your robe.</p>
<p>‘But first you must leave this realm and save the girl.’ You nod your head. ‘You will have to bargain with the Master.’ You look puzzled and the man explains: ‘All who come to the Realm of Paradox may ask for a gift from the god and, if it is within his power, he must give it. But beware his bargains. He has many cruel gifts: gifts such as these.’ Oz-na-Mun raises his hands and you look at them with horror. They are the hands of a giant and are grossly out of proportion with the rest of his body.</p>
<p>‘Once, I was a great sculptor and in my home realm of Meledor I was respected by all. But I hungered for greater success. I took up the company of a mage and one night we summoned the Chaos-master together. His spirit came easily, for the realm of Meledor and the Realm of Paradox are joined. I told him that I desired the greatest hands in the world that I might make the greatest sculptures in the world. He said he could grant me my wish on condition that I remain in his realm until completion of my first work. I agreed and as soon as I was brought here, I discovered that my hands had been transformed. However, they were not as I had wished: they were clumsy, rough, fit only for digging clay not shaping it. I have never made another piece.’ He curls a huge hand into a fist and punches the shapeless mass before him. ‘Beware the bargains of the Chaos-master. He is a malevolent god.’</p>
<p>‘What does he want with the girl, Tanith?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘He will bargain with her, also.’ He tells you that you can summon the Chaos-master by calling to him for audience. ‘But beware! The bargains of the Chaos-master are in keeping with the law of Paradox: opposites and contradictions.’</p>
<p>‘There is no other way of saving Tanith,’ you reply, sadly. ‘I must summon the Chaos-master.’</p>

<p>Carefully, you pick your way around the tower, but you are unable to find a door and soon find yourself back where you started. Bemused, you sigh and frown in puzzlement. ‘If someone bothered to write that inscription, they must have bothered to make a door,’ you say to Tanith.</p>

<p>You have landed in a large field. In the distance you see the hazy outline of a city, gleaming in the sunlight. You take out the Gyronome and its tone confirms that you are in the Realm of the Singing City. Several people are running towards you from the city; they are fair haired, have strange, circular ears, and are dressed in short, white togas.

<p>Immediately ahead, the bank of rolling cloud is fast transforming into a violent storm. Quickly, it surrounds the Ethetron. The Jahksa has summoned against you the Elementals that have served you so well in the past. You close your eyes and call out in the sibilant tongue of the Elemental spirits.</p>

<p>Above your head, where the sky should be, the blue waters of an ocean roll, rippling with foam-crested waves. Below, green hills and fields shift and move like water. The Ethetron rocks violently. You are no longer able to choose between up and down, left or right. Mountains stand upon their peaks; towns and cities drift past; night becomes day, and day becomes night in quick succession; a huge fist rears up, poised to strike, and then passes through you like a phantom.

<p>Anxiously you search around but there is no indication that this realm contains any peculiar features. Then a strange symmetrical shape, quite unlike a star, catches your eye.

It is a Trianon, a creation of the Shianti; instinctively you know that this must be the place where the Moonstone is hidden.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a fearsome shriek distracts your attention from the ancient Shianti tomb. The starlit sky is now full of terrible creatures.</p>

Rainbows of colour splash from the delicate spires and splendid ivory towers that point towards the sky. Like the distant ringing of a million tiny bells, the music of the city reaches your ears. You hear the warm resonance of a shifting bass accompanied by pure, whispering harmonies as delicate as a breeze, and you are awestruck by the magnificence of the city. The Academicians told you that the Elessin are cruel creatures, but their city suggests a purity of spirit beyond any mortal imagining.</p>

<p>You are led to a high-ceilinged chamber lit by a curious, pulsing light. The room is filled with strange, ornate machines of gleaming metal. Lights flicker and you hear a throbbing hum and a continual, metallic, mechanical ring. Several Academicians tend the machines, pushing buttons and pulling levers, though to what purpose you cannot guess.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star, Tanith—allow me to introduce you to Crabkey, one of our greatest and most ingenious inventors.’</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="644" width="386" src="ill9.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration IX</strong>—‘Allow me to introduce Crabkey, one of our most ingenious inventors.’
<br /><br /></div><p>You recognize the shabby man who turns to greet you; he was the man who sat in the armchair when you first entered the chamber of the Academicians. In the strange lurid glow of the laboratory his shadowed, bulging eyes make him appear even more sinister than before. ‘We meet again,’ you say uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Crabkey stares at you without speaking. Spittlethrift breaks the silence: ‘Mr Crabkey is the inventor of the machine that will enable you to journey to the Realm of the Singing City, aren’t you, Crabkey, old chap?’ Crabkey continues to stare at you insolently. With a slow blink of his huge eyes, he makes an unintelligible sound in the back of his throat and nods.</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes,’ says Spittlethrift half to himself. ‘Come now, young Wizard and pretty mistress Tanith, come see his wonderful creation.’ Mounted on a small dais in the centre of the laboratory is a most unusual machine. ‘This,’ says Spittlethrift proudly, ‘is the Ethetron, the flying machine that will carry young Grey Star through the realms of the Daziarn, and to the Singing City to fetch our prize.’</p>
<p>‘Grey Star,’ says Tanith suddenly, ‘and what of me?’</p>
<p>Spittlethrift falters and emits an embarrassed cough, ‘Ah, yes…well…’</p>
<p>‘Yes, what of Tanith?’ you demand angrily.</p>
<p>‘The girl stays here,’ says Crabkey, speaking for the first time in a harsh, rasping voice, ‘to make sure you keep your part of the bargain and do not fail to return.’</p>
<p>‘She will be perfectly safe, I assure you,’ says Spittlethrift, apologetically. ‘But surely you understand our position. What is to stop you flying away and never returning?’</p>
<p>‘And if I refuse?’ you snap at Spittlethrift.</p>
<p>‘We will not allow you to use the Ethetron or show you how to fly it,’ retorts Crabkey. ‘You will be doomed to remain within the Neverness for all eternity. You will—’</p>
<p>‘You will, on the other hand,’ Spittlethrift interjects hastily, ‘receive the Ethetron as a gift from us when you return—’</p>
<p>‘With the Threnogem,’ Crabkey interrupts once more, ignoring a glare of warning from Spittlethrift, who has now begun to sweat profusely. ‘And we will return Mistress Tanith to you, of course,’ he finishes. Tanith clenches her fists and glares furiously at the two little men. Both step back a little from her fiery gaze. ‘Know this, little man,’ she hisses, prodding Spittlethrift in the chest with one, long-nailed finger. ‘I am not without power. If you seek to deceive us…I’ll crush you like the toad that you are! I am a Shadakine Wytch, not a mere girl to be hoarded or bartered like a piece of spare luggage!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes, of course,’ says Spittlethrift, wiping his brow with the back of his shaking hand. ‘I understand.’</p>
<p>You smile quietly to yourself. Tanith’s angry bluff has shaken both Spittlethrift and Crabkey. Though Tanith does possess many uncanny powers taught to her while in the service of Mother Magri, a powerful Wytch in the service of the Shadakine Empire, her skills lie chiefly in her mastery of animals and nature and in a bravery that surpasses many warriors of greater stature. Tanith turns to you, the fire dying in her wild, green eyes. ‘Accept their offer, Grey Star,’ she says. ‘I do not fear this over-fed worm, or that slinking weasel.’</p>
<p>You sense that Tanith is far more afraid than she admits but the success of the quest is as important to her as it is to you and without the Ethetron it is unlikely that you will succeed. ‘Very well,’ you say. ‘Show me how the machine works. What must I do?’</p>
<p>Sullenly, Crabkey shows you the machine. Spittlethrift, pale and perspiring, remains silent, his chubby hands fluttering nervously at his side.</p>

<p><i>This was once the realm of the Demon, Steth-Amon, a master of sound,</i> the Guardian recounts. <i>We, the Elessin, were created his slave singers, a choir of the damned. His was the music of dissonance; it could drive men insane or lure them and possess their minds. Long we laboured in his service. However, we sought the beauty of harmonious music, the melody of accord and we conceived of a plan to overthrow our lord. We created the Threnogem, a tool of silence, for without silence music has no meaning. Then, while he slumbered, we dropped the Threnogem into his open mouth and silenced him, robbing him of his power over us. He froze in the position you see him now, for the statue is Steth-Amon, mastered by the silence of the Threnogem. That you seek to take the statue from our realm is pleasing to us, for all our power has been devoted to giving life to the Threnogem and keeping Steth-Amon silent. If the Threnogem is removed from his mouth the demon will be released. All we ask is that you do not remove the Threnogem while you are in our domain. If you wish, we will help you carry the statue to your flying machine.</i></p>
<p>You agree to the Guardian’s offer.</p>

<p>The Ethetron is quite unlike anything you have seen before. It has a railed platform, and is shaped like a saucer, except that its stern is pointed like a lizard’s tail. It bears a large glass dome in its centre. Passing through the top of the dome is a single black shaft like the mast of a sailing ship. The single sail resembles a giant bat’s wings and is made of a strange material that shimmers like water and looks like metal but is like fabric to the touch. A closer inspection of the glass dome reveals that it contains a swirling, grey-white mist.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="628" width="386" src="ill10.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration X</strong>—The Ethetron’s tail is like a lizard’s, its sails like bats’ wings.
<br /><br /></div><p>‘It is the raw stuff of the Daziarn, unformed power for the craft,’ explains Crabkey. ‘Without it, the craft would fall from the sky. To steer,’ he continues, ‘you must operate this lever—pull to climb, push to dive, left and right as normal. To draw more power from the glass dome you must press this metal bar at your feet; to slow down, release it. If you apply no pressure, the craft will remain where it is; if you push the lever to the left or right without power, the craft will spin on its axis. Beware, these controls are very sensitive. You need apply very little pressure to make the craft change its course.’</p>
<p>When Crabkey is satisfied that you understand the controls, he introduces you to another Academician, Slypate, who hands you a shining sphere of red and yellow metal. ‘This is a Gyronome. There is no north, east, west, or south in the plane of the Daziarn, nor is there time as you perceive it,’ says Slypate. ‘The only way of finding the Singing City is with the aid of this device. When you draw it out, it will emit a sound if you are heading for the Singing City. The louder the note, the surer your course. To return to the Crystal Tower, the Gyronome must be absolutely silent. It is very accurate: I invented it myself,’ he says with pride. You take the Special Item and place it in your pocket. (Remember to mark the Gyronome on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>Soon you are ready to leave. The Academicians offer you the choice of the following items to aid you in your quest. (Remember that you may carry only two Weapons and a maximum of eight items in your Backpack.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Short Sword (carried in a sheath worn at your belt)</li>
<li>Length of strong Rope (Backpack Item)</li>
<li>Potion of Healing (restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when swallowed; carried in Backpack)</li>
<li>Backpack</li>
<li>Spear (carried in the hand)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you climb into the Ethetron, the massive double windows of the laboratory are drawn open. The restraining ropes are untied and the glass dome of the flying machine glows with a ghostly light. You coax the Ethetron forwards and you glide gently through the open windows and out of the Crystal Tower. You look out across the bleak, featureless expanse of the Neverness with its strange, sunless sky and vast plain of unending cloud. You press lightly on the foot bar and the machine gathers speed. You take out the Gyronome. It is silent at first; then as your machine speeds away from the Crystal Tower it begins to emit a tone. You move the instrument around in the air and find, to your surprise, that its tone becomes louder when you point it towards your feet.</p>

<p>Believing that Tanith is held by means of enchantment, you decide to fight like with like. Tanith and the gaunt man are still cowering in the corner of the room. Patiently you sit down on a wooden chair opposite and begin the trance. You know that you cannot dispel Tanith’s illusion; you must enable her to do that herself if she is to be free.</p>
<p>When you have shaped the illusion in your mind you transfer it to hers. You begin to recall, moment by moment, all the events that you and she have shared. You start from the time when you first met in the dungeons of Mother Magri and she, a serving girl in the Wytch’s service, offered you food and pity. You go on to describe her role in your escape.

<p>Tense with anticipation, you wait as the figures draw near. Each wears a short white toga; they have blonde hair and strange, circular ears.</p>
<p>As soon as they arrive they begin speaking to you in a language you cannot understand. Their voices are soft and flute-like and there is a lilting quality to their speech. These are Elessin, inhabitants of the Singing City. Excitedly, they chatter on, pointing at both the Ethetron and the sky. You soon realize that they wish you to go to the Singing City with them.</p>

<p>The webbed claw rakes the side of the Ethetron, but your swift reflexes save you from certain death. As the monstrous limb sinks back into the mist, Tanith points to a crack that has appeared in the glass dome that contains the power which drives the craft. The Ethetron starts to lose height, sinking slowly into the swirling mystery below.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there is a hideous roar and seven eyeless heads on long, slender necks wave before you like monstrous flowers in a breeze. Twenty feet tall, with teeth like razors, they sway this way and that, blindly seeking you out. A giant head sways barely a few feet away and a yawning mouth bears down on you.</p>

<p>‘Wait, dragon,’ you call, as the mighty beast makes to leave. ‘What do you know of these Keys? Which one will open the Crystal Tower? What lies beyond?’</p>
<p>The dragon peers down at you, a wisp of smoke curling from its nostrils and winding around its long, reptilian head. ‘Little Wizard,’ he says in a deep, rumbling voice, ‘thy friend hath mastered a dragon. What more couldst thou seek to achieve?’ You say nothing, and with a weary tone, the dragon continues. ‘Each Key can summon the beast in whose likeness it hath been fashioned. These are not true beasts but spirit creatures. He who can master beasts may master these creatures also, otherwise he will be slain by them.’</p>
<p>‘Which Key opens the door to the Crystal Tower?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘Of this, I cannot speak, save to tell that the answer lies hidden in the words above the door,’ the dragon answers reluctantly. With these words, the dragon lifts its broad wings and soars into the sky, swiftly disappearing from view.</p>

<p><i>This was once the realm of the Demon, Steth-Amon, Master of Sound. We, the Elessin, were created his slave singers, a choir of the damned, and long did we labour in his service. His was the music of dissonance, designed to drive his victims insane or to lure them with its enticements. Steth-Amon would sow seeds of discord and clamour in the realms of mortals so that they would join him and then be doomed to lives of misery under his dominion. But we, the Elessin, conceived of a plan to overthrow him, for we desire the beauty of music: harmony and the melody of accord. We created the Threnogem, a tool of silence, for without silence there can be no true music. While he slumbered we dropped the Threnogem into his open mouth and silenced him. Robbed of his power, the power of his mighty voice, he froze as you see him now.</i></p>
<p>He gestures towards the statue beneath the swirling pillar of light. <i>We built this place to contain him and called it the Palace of the Screaming God. Each day we sing our song, giving force to the Threnogem so that the Screaming God should remain forever silent. All our power is dedicated to this single act, for his was a great evil. If the Threnogem is removed, the Screaming God will be released. Those who have sent you upon this quest know not of this, or else they do not care. Perhaps they desire to free the Screaming God, or wish your death. However, there is a way for you to fulfil your bargain and do us a great service, too.</i></p>
<p>Yet another bargain! ‘What is it you wish me to do?’ you ask.</p>
<p><i>Take the statue with you,</i> the Guardian replies. <i>Take it in your flying machine and remove it from this realm. Give the statue, with the Threnogem inside it, to the Academicians. Let them guard it as we have done. It would be just.</i></p>

Your progress is further impeded by the illusory nature of the tower: crevices and projections that make up the strange designs that ornament the tower sometimes disappear from view just when you reach for a handhold.

<p>‘Splendid! Splendid!’ says a cheerful voice. You spin round to see a little fat man, dressed head-to-toe in a black gown. He claps his pudgy hands together and smiles happily.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="638" width="386" src="ill19.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration XIX</strong>—Spittlethrift claps his pudgy hands together and smiles happily.
<br /><br /></div><p>‘Who are you?’ you ask, still breathless.</p>
<p>‘I am Spittlethrift, scholar, professor, and master of the Crystal Tower. Yes, yes…a tower of learning, a veritable pillar of wisdom and knowledge, ha, ha, indeed!’ He takes a pair of wire-framed spectacles and places them on the end of his smudge of a nose. ‘You are not alone, I see.’ He squints at Tanith. ‘Most pleasing, enchanting…yes, yes, well done! You have passed the test; you will suffice.’ He turns towards the door and flutters his hands in an agitated manner. ‘Come now, you must meet the rest of us. Oh yes, delightful, engaging, so wonderfully entertaining!’</p>
<p>The excitable little man leaves the room, still chuckling to himself, and you follow close behind. Soon, he ushers you into a dim room, which is dusty and full of cobwebs. The air is stale and thick with tobacco smoke and seated opposite in a large armchair is a thin, straggling man, roughly Spittlethrift’s height, with bulging, shadowy eyes. Reclining in various positions around the room are several others, all approximately Spittlethrift’s height, and all similarly dressed.</p>
<p>‘Gentlemen, gentlemen, we have guests, brave adventurers who have solved the complications of our dark abode. May I introduce…’</p>
<p>He casts a questioning glance in your direction and, hesitantly, you say, ‘The Wizard, Grey Star, and the lady, Tanith.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes, Grey Star and Tanith,’ Spittlethrift repeats, unnecessarily. He turns to face you. ‘And we are the Academicians. Welcome.’ He bows politely, as do the remaining scholars in the dingy room. After shaking hands with more than twenty Academicians, all with very curious names, you are led from the room to Spittlethrift’s study. There he explains to you the cryptic nature of the Crystal Tower and the Academicians’ purpose on the Daziarn Plane.</p>
<p>‘We are scholars, my dear boy,’ says Spittlethrift. ‘Inventors, scientists, inquisitors of the unknown. Here, on the Daziarn Plane, we have been able to turn our dreams, our ideas, our very thoughts into reality. It is the nature of this place. Time, space, the fundamental laws that govern existence in the material world—all can be adjusted, altered, ignored even! That is why we choose to live here. Others have changed their world within the Daziarn to suit their purpose. The demons and devils of good and evil reside here, creating their surroundings as best it suits them. There are gods and their ilk, and stranger forces beyond all imagining. Their thoughts, hopes, fears, and intentions weave the fabric of their realms. We do not seek to dominate or master the realm we inhabit—we live only within our tower. The Neverness—the unformed cloud that surrounds us—is the fabric of the Daziarn, unclaimed and untainted. It is this that we use for our…experiments.’</p>
<p>‘You mean the black holes that surround the tower?’ you enquire.</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes,’ Spittlethrift replies.</p>
<p>‘But why is the tower so dangerous?’</p>
<p>‘Ah!’ says Spittlethrift. ‘Let me assure you that it is not for our simple amusement, nor is it due to a malicious dislike for visitors, that our tower has been built to test the cunning, the wits, the wiles, and the bravery of those who dare to enter.’</p>
<p>‘And those who fail?’ asks Tanith, scornfully. ‘What happens to them?’</p>
<p>The little man clears his throat, uncomfortably, dismissing Tanith’s question with a wave of his hand. ‘No matter of importance. You have succeeded; you’ve triumphed. You have proved yourselves capable of fulfilling a great quest.’</p>
<p>‘I am already upon a quest,’ you say. ‘I have no time for another.’</p>
<p>‘That is what you think, m’boy,’ says Spittlethrift. ‘But you’ve yet to understand. You are in the Neverness. The Neverness leads nowhere, borders on nowhere, is nowhere. Without our help you will never leave it. Embark upon our quest and we will grant you the means to travel freely about the Daziarn. Refuse, and you will remain here, perhaps forever.’</p>
<p>‘You threaten me?’ you say menacingly, rising to your feet.</p>
<p>‘No, no!’ splutters the scholar, hastily. ‘I merely state the facts. The Neverness is a wilderland between the realms of the Daziarn but it does not connect the realms as the mountains, seas, and roads in your world do. We, however, have found a way to travel the realms and can grant you the means to do so if you will perform a simple task for us.’ You say nothing, and Spittlethrift goes on. ‘There is a place, a city of glass, called the Singing City, inhabited by a race called the Elessin. We wish you to journey to the Singing City and steal the Threnogem from them. It is a stone, said to emit music and control the emotions of all who hear its melody. The Elessin have put it to evil use; we merely wish to explore its powers. You will be helping the enslaved and furthering our search for knowledge. Please will you help us, Grey Star?’</p>

<p>The Jahksa has chosen to leave this realm and his body is dematerializing before your eyes. ‘Thanks for the entertainment, Wizardling…’ he sneers as he disappears, and you hear his fading voice. ‘We shall meet again.’</p>
<p>‘I shall look forward to that,’ you say, through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>‘Come, Grey Star,’ says Tanith. ‘We must speak with Oz-na-Mun if we are to find our way out of this place.’</p>
<p>You find Oz-na-Mun in his shack. The gaunt-faced man looks up at you with solemn eyes. ‘The evil one—has he gone?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ says Tanith. ‘He will not return.’</p>
<p>‘Good. You have my sympathy, Grey Star. It must be a terrible trial to have a foe such as he.’</p>
<p>‘It is Shasarak who is the foe,’ you say, ‘and he is cunning. For surely there is something that each of us fears in ourselves. What better opponent than a creature that wears my shape, knows my thoughts, and can anticipate my moves?’</p>
<p>‘I hear that you seek the Moonstone,’ says Oz-na-Mun. You nod your reply. ‘I have prepared a map for you. It will guide you to the Gate by which you can leave this realm. There is a mountain that lies nearby. It is called the Moaning Mountain because of the sound of the wind that blows through it. In the side of the mountain is a cavern: the Gate is there. The Gate leads to a place that people call the Vale of Peace. The people of the Vale are wise and kind and they will show you the way to the hidden realm of the Moonstone.’ He hands you the Cloth Map. (Mark this as a Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>; it can be carried in a small pocket inside your robe.)</p>
<p>You bid farewell to Oz-na-Mun and return to the Ethetron. Soon you are heading for the Moaning Mountain and the Gate that will carry you from the Realm of Paradox to the Vale of Peace.</p>

<p>You head towards the gate and the Elessin guard regards you with a look of astonishment. He speaks to you but you can only shrug, for you do not understand. He offers no threat, but bows, and with a welcoming sweep of his hand bids you pass through the gate. You enter a long avenue of crystal stones, alert for the slightest sign of danger.</p>

<p>With one final effort you throw a further <small>WILLPOWER</small> point into your attempt to reach Tanith. The effort is strenuous and also costs you 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Your illusion is almost over and you begin to fear that you will fail but, as you reach your reunion with Tanith at the Shadow Gate, a glimmer of recognition lights in her eyes. ‘Is it true?’ she whispers. ‘Is it really true?’ Unsteadily, she climbs to her feet and walks towards you with slow, faltering steps. She stands before you and you sense that you have broken through the barrier that covered her mind. You reach out and draw her near to you.</p>
<p>‘It’s me,’ you whisper.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star,’ she sobs. ‘I thought…it was in my mind…the Black Wizard, he had your face. He took me from the Crystal Tower and brought me here. The Chaos-master asked me what gift I desired and I asked for you, Grey Star. Then the Chaos-master told me that the Black Wizard was you and then my mind was full of hate and loathing. I…’</p>
<p>‘You don’t have to explain; it’s all right, I understand,’ you say. From outside the shack, a sneering voice sends an unnatural chill through your body.</p>
<p>‘How touching; how nice. Such understanding.’ The evil voice laughs, mockingly. You run outside to see a hooded figure in a black robe carrying a black staff. Slowly, deliberately, the hood is pulled aside to reveal your own face; your own eyes stare back at you as if you were looking into a mirror. ‘Greetings, brother,’ says your voice, with a bitter laugh. ‘We meet at last.’</p>

<p>You take up the Key. As you go to place it in the lock, a terrifying sound freezes you to the spot. First, you hear the rattling of wings, and then you see a looming shadow of huge proportions; it is a dragon of old! Green and scaly, the monstrous winged reptile hurtles towards you, its razor-like teeth bared to the sunless sky. A bright plume of flame trails from its mouth and the heat of the flame sears your face. In moments the dragon will be upon you. Bravely, you step forward and prepare to meet this terrifying challenge. ‘Wait!’ screams Tanith. ‘Let me deal with this!’</p>

<p>You are back in the Neverness; the bleak, sunless sky and the unending plain of grey cloud stretches away from you.<sup><a href="#sect278-1-foot" name="sect278-1">27</a></sup> Soon you sight the familiar shape of the Crystal Tower and land the craft close to its door. ‘Spittlethrift!’ you shout. ‘I have returned. Come, take your prize.’ A window in the tower opens and the face of Spittlethrift appears. He is ashen-grey and trembling with fear.</p>
<p>‘Go away!’ he calls. ‘We’ve nothing else to give you. The girl…she was not ours to give in the first place.’</p>
<p>‘It is I, Grey Star,’ you shout. ‘Open up. I have brought the Threnogem as I promised.’</p>
<p>The little man stares down at you, shocked and afraid. ‘But…but,’ he stammers, ‘you have only just left, you…you were changed, so full of darkness and…this is not possible!’</p>
<p>‘Let me in,’ you demand, ‘or it will be the worse for you.’</p>
<p>The window slams shut and after a short wait, Spittlethrift throws open the door. ‘Is it really you?’ he asks, incredulous.</p>
<p>‘What has happened?’ you demand, growing angry. ‘Where is Tanith? Return her to me!’</p>
<p>‘She is gone. You…or, should I say, someone like you was here but a short while ago. We could not understand the change in you, you had so much more power. We were afraid. We gave up the girl, even though the Threnogem had not been brought back to us.’</p>
<p>After more questioning, you are able to piece together what happened while you were in the Realm of the Singing City. It seems that someone who looked exactly like you, clad in a black robe, came to the Crystal Tower. He had an evil countenance and was able to master the Academicians easily. They gave up Tanith to the Black Wizard and he left. He had been asking questions about the Realm of Paradox and one named Oz-na-Mun, the man with the mighty hand. It appears that he was on his way there. The Academicians say that he had no craft but was able to travel the realms at will.</p>

<p>The Chaos-birds are circling the becalmed Ethetron as Tanith chants over the Key. They draw together, ready to attack, but then suddenly break into shrieks of alarm. Like you they can hear the rustle and flap of leathery wings beating the air. The birds are thrown into a panic as the howling dragon falls upon them. The Ethetron is buffeted as the dragon and the Chaos-birds battle in mid-air.</p>

<p>‘I must refuse,’ you say to Spittlethrift. ‘Mine is an urgent quest. The needs of many weigh heavily upon my shoulders.’</p>
<p>‘Ah now,’ Spittlethrift replies. ‘This is unfortunate.’ Suddenly, the many Academicians in the room rise as one and, before you can act, you and Tanith are held firmly by many hands and your Staff is snatched away.</p>
<p>‘Crabkey,’ calls Spittlethrift to the spindly man who now holds Tanith, his dagger at her heart, ‘take the girl away.’</p>
<p>You struggle against the restraining grip of the Academicians. ‘If you so much as harm her…’</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes,’ says Spittlethrift, smoothly. ‘Fear not.’ Tanith is led from the room. ‘Our intention is merely to persuade you of the importance of our quest. She will be quite safe if you comply with our wishes.’</p>
<p>You cast Spittlethrift a scowl. ‘Very well. Since you offer me no choice…’</p>
<p>‘Indeed, indeed. I thought you would see things our way. Now, come along—to the laboratory. I will show you the wondrous craft that will take you to the Singing City.’</p>
<p>You are led to a high-ceilinged chamber, lit with a curious, pulsating light and containing many strange and ornate machines of gleaming metal. Having attended to the imprisonment of Tanith, Crabkey enters the laboratory.</p>
<p>‘Allow me to introduce you properly to Mr Crabkey,’ says Spittlethrift. In the lurid glow of the laboratory his shadowed, bulging eyes make him look more sinister than before. ‘Mr Crabkey is the inventor of the machine that will enable you to make your journey, aren’t you Crabkey, old chap?’ Crabkey stares at you with his large, baleful eyes. With a slow blink, he makes an unintelligible sound in the back of his throat and nods.</p>
<p>‘Here,’ says Crabkey, ‘is the Ethetron.’ Mounted on a small dais in the centre of the laboratory is a most unusual machine.</p>

<p>The Chaos-master’s braying laughter fills the hall as he watches the stunned expression on your face. ‘Are you not amused?’ he roars.</p>
<p>You study your identical twin opposite and sense an aura of evil. It is a creation of Shasarak, sent to thwart your final bid to claim the Moonstone. In the Shianti language such a creature is known as a Jahksa, the spiritual apparition of one already living, a perversion of nature and a being of great evil. Without the human emotions of guilt, remorse, and sorrow, a Jahksa has no conscience or morals, and is a passionless killer.</p>
<p>‘And now,’ intones the Chaos-master, when the echo of his laughter has finally subsided, ‘tell me what it is you seek?’ Carefully, you weigh in your mind what you should ask.</p>

<p>Suddenly, within the space of a heartbeat, the white-light horizon appears to turn inside out, its near and far sides interchanging.

Buffeted by the wind, you struggle to control the Ethetron as it rocks and reels wildly in the wind-torn sky. Still dazed by the experiences of the past few minutes, you cannot help but manipulate the control clumsily.</p>

<p>Since you are unable to take the Threnogem from the statue’s mouth, the only solution is to steal the whole statue. You approach the grotesque figure but, before you can attempt to lift it, you hear a voice echo urgently in your mind: <i>Stop!</i> it cries. Instinctively you spin round to see a tall figure draped in white. He holds a jewelled crozier high in his hands. He has the power of telepathy, and with it he is ordering you to remain where you are. A number of Elessin guards crowd close behind him.</p>

<p>Closing your eyes, you send the power of your thought into the future in search of a clue that will help you find the door. The image that forms in your mind is identical to that of the plate bearing the inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
         ‘From south of here, to west, and north,<br />
         Then east and south once more,<br />
         A circle’s motion rings the charm<br />
         That finds the Vanishing Door.’<br />
        </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Your Power of Prophecy is usually of more use than this, your visions of the future far clearer. You conclude that the door is masked by magic and that the inscription is the only clue that can help you find it.</p>
<p>Frustrated, you read the inscription again. You have expended 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point; adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>

<p>Gently, you move forward, but as your foot steps onto the flagstone, a great broadsword falls from the ceiling, killing you instantly.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect350">350</a></h3>

<p>Triumphantly, the Jahksa deals a killing blow. You feel a searing pain tear through your body, but miraculously you are not slain. The Moonstone, instrument of judgement and truth, has made a reality of Shasarak’s mockery of you. In killing you the Jahksa has killed itself. With a howl, the Jahksa dissolves into black shadows and returns to the spirit realm from whence it came.</p>

It flares, as if in recognition, at the touch of your hand. It glows with a warm, familiar feeling as it nestles in the palm of your hand. Tanith’s eyes are wild and shining with triumph. You have fulfilled your pledge and completed the quest…almost. Armed with the might of the Moonstone, you now possess the only known power that could throw down the evil Wytch-king, Shasarak. But that is another story, and the day is yet to come.</p>
<p>The final conflict in your fight against the Shadakine Empire is concluded in Book 4 of the Grey Star saga, entitled:</p>

<h2><a name="footnotz">Footnotes</a></h2>


<div class="footnote"><p>[<a name="gamerulz-1-foot" href="#gamerulz-1">1</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) This section of the rules implies that you must re-pick all three scores—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, <small>WILLPOWER</small>, and <small>ENDURANCE</small>—even though you may have already completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books and therefore appears to be a mistake. In order to preserve rule consistency among the books, you may choose to retain your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores and only re-pick your <small>WILLPOWER</small> score.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-2-foot" href="#gamerulz-2">2</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) If you have completed <a href="../../gs/02tfc/title.htm#title">Book Two</a> but not <a href="../../gs/01gstw/title.htm#title">Book One</a>, it seems reasonable to add 25 to the number you picked.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-4-foot" href="#gamerulz-4">3</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) There are sections in the <cite>Grey Star</cite> books that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This may leave you with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm#sect175">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm#title"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, then you use <small>ENDURANCE</small> points at a rate of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points for every 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point you lack (i.e. 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points = 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point). If your <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <small>WILLPOWER</small> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score.</p>
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-3-foot" href="#gamerulz-3">4</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <small>WILLPOWER</small> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <small>WILLPOWER</small>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p><p>[<a name="powers-1-foot" href="#powers-1">5</a>]  (<a href="#powers">Magical Powers</a>) The wording of this section of the rules seems to indicate—if read literally—that you may choose your set of Powers again if you have completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books. In order to preserve consistency with other books, you should not choose your Powers again. If you have completed at least one previous adventure, you may choose one additional Power from the list. If you choose Alchemy as your new Magical Power, you also receive a Herb Pouch with contents, as detailed in the <a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a> section.</p><p>[<a name="powers-2-foot" href="#powers-2">6</a>]  (<a href="#powers">Magical Powers</a>) If your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p><p>[<a name="equipmnt-1-foot" href="#equipmnt-1">7</a>]  (<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a>) If you have completed a previous adventure, you keep all equipment you had at the end of that adventure. You do not receive any new equipment, unless you have just selected Alchemy as your sixth Magical Power, in which case you receive a Herb Pouch with contents as indicated in this section.</p><p>[<a name="equipmnt-2-foot" href="#equipmnt-2">8</a>]  (<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a>) If you have mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy and therefore have a Herb Pouch, you may choose to keep potions, vials, or ingredients in either the Herb Pouch or your Backpack. All other Backpack Items must be kept in your Backpack.</p><p>[<a name="equipmnt-3-foot" href="#equipmnt-3">9</a>]  (<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a>) The Collector’s Editions of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books clarify that ‘You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.’</p><p>[<a name="sect78-1-foot" href="#sect78-1">10</a>]  (<a href="#sect78">Section 78</a>) As you are using your Power of Elementalism against the Chaos-birds, you should deduct 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point.</p><p>[<a name="sect106-1-foot" href="#sect106-1">11</a>]  (<a href="#sect106">Section 106</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p><p>[<a name="sect107-1-foot" href="#sect107-1">12</a>]  (<a href="#sect107">Section 107</a>) If the Elessi leader has been holding your Wizard’s Staff until now, you can now take it back.</p><p>[<a name="sect118-1-foot" href="#sect118-1">13</a>]  (<a href="#sect118">Section 118</a>) If you have already opened this door, you do not need to do it again. If you have opened the door but chosen <em>not</em> to step through it, you can now choose to do so (turn to <a href="#sect125">125</a>), or to walk back to the large stairway (turn to <a href="#sect239">239</a>). If you have both opened and ventured inside the door, you must turn to <a href="#sect239">239</a>.</p><p>[<a name="sect144-1-foot" href="#sect144-1">14</a>]  (<a href="#sect144">Section 144</a>) There is no choice that leads to this section of the book. This appears to be an oversight which is not easily correctable.</p><p>[<a name="sect148-1-foot" href="#sect148-1">15</a>]  (<a href="#sect148">Section 148</a>) As you are using your Wizard’s Staff against the Jahksa, you should deduct 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points.</p><p>[<a name="sect150-1-foot" href="#sect150-1">16</a>]  (<a href="#sect150">Section 150</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p><p>[<a name="sect177-1-foot" href="#sect177-1">17</a>]  (<a href="#sect177">Section 177</a>) You must choose whether to keep the individual buds or to mix potions from them. You may not do both.</p><p>[<a name="sect182-1-foot" href="#sect182-1">18</a>]  (<a href="#sect182">Section 182</a>) If the Elessin confiscated your Weapons, including your Wizard’s Staff, these are now returned to you.</p><p>[<a name="sect186-1-foot" href="#sect186-1">19</a>]  (<a href="#sect186">Section 186</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p><p>[<a name="sect190-1-foot" href="#sect190-1">20</a>]  (<a href="#sect190">Section 190</a>) There is no choice that leads to this section of the book. This appears to be an oversight which is not easily correctable.</p><p>[<a name="sect191-1-foot" href="#sect191-1">21</a>]  (<a href="#sect191">Section 191</a>) If you carry any other Weapon in addition to your Wizard’s Staff, the Elessin have confiscated this too (but not any weapon-like Special Items). Note this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p><p>[<a name="sect197-1-foot" href="#sect197-1">22</a>]  (<a href="#sect197">Section 197</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p><p>[<a name="sect231-1-foot" href="#sect231-1">23</a>]  (<a href="#sect231">Section 231</a>) Remember that you may only use those Keys you possess.</p><p>[<a name="sect240-1-foot" href="#sect240-1">24</a>]  (<a href="#sect240">Section 240</a>) You may keep any Keys that you have already noted on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. You may also keep any Keys that you have not used—which might be the Eagle Key, the Wolf Key, the Spider Key, and/or the Dragon Key. List all Keys to the Crystal Tower as a single Backpack Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (noting which Keys are included). If you do not want to carry the Keys in your Backpack, you can let Tanith carry them, but you must then note down that you cannot access them if Tanith is not with you.</p><p>[<a name="sect242-1-foot" href="#sect242-1">25</a>]  (<a href="#sect242">Section 242</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p><p>[<a name="sect252-1-foot" href="#sect252-1">26</a>]  (<a href="#sect252">Section 252</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p><p>[<a name="sect278-1-foot" href="#sect278-1">27</a>]  (<a href="#sect278">Section 278</a>) If you left your Backpack in the Ethetron, you now regain access to it and all of the items therein.</p><p>[<a name="sect287-1-foot" href="#sect287-1">28</a>]  (<a href="#sect287">Section 287</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p><p>[<a name="sect305-1-foot" href="#sect305-1">29</a>]  (<a href="#sect305">Section 305</a>) If you choose to keep them, note the Coins and a maximum of one Medallion as Special Items on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you choose to keep more than one Medallion, the rest must be carried in your Backpack where they take up one space each.</p><p>[<a name="sect344-1-foot" href="#sect344-1">30</a>]  (<a href="#sect344">Section 344</a>) Make a note on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> that you have left your Backpack and all Backpack Items in the Ethetron.
