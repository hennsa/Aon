   <p>You are the Wizard Grey Star. You now face the tumultuous climax of your epic struggle to overthrow the evil Wytch-king Shasarak. His cruel empire is torn by war as the Freedom Fighters rebel against his corrupt dominion. Can you reach them in time to free mankind? Can you overcome the Wytch-king’s ferocious soldiers and the supernatural hordes that are his to command? Your only hope lies in your Wizard’s Staff. Guard it well—for it contains the might of the mystic Moonstone, the very essence of your Magical Powers.</p>

   <p><cite>The World of Lone Wolf</cite> is an exciting adventure series in which you are the hero, you make the decisions, and you fight the combats using the unique systems included in the book.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Ian Page</strong> was born in London in 1960. Since the age of sixteen he has pursued a successful career as a singer/songwriter. With the band Secret Affair, he had a string of chart hits to his credit including <cite>Time for Action</cite> and <cite>My World</cite>. His interest in the fantastic worlds of ‘Sword and Sorcery’ dates back to his early teens, and to his love of the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien and Michael Moorcock. It was in 1979, when Joe Dever introduced him to role-playing games, that his involvement in the world of Magnamund began. He contributed greatly to the development of the southern reaches of this fantastic world, and worked closely with Joe on several other role-playing games projects that include TV and radio appearances.</p>

   <p>Ian has since re-entered the music industry with a band known as <a href="http://www.theaffair.co.uk/">The Affair</a>.</p>


      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels and editor for the World of Lone Wolf series, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Paul Bonner</strong> is the illustrator of the World of Lone Wolf series of gamebooks. His childhood love of ‘folk-tales, fairy-stories, <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, Scandinavian tales, myths, and sagas’ led Paul Bonner to spend four years at Harrow, a London art school, on an illustrating course of study.</p>

   <p>His artwork for the <cite>World of Lone Wolf</cite> series is among his earliest professional work. He subsequently started freelancing for Games Workshop and later accepted a full-time position. He worked there for a few years before moving on to produce full-colour artwork (which Games Workshop had not required from him). He moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and again began to work as a freelance illustrator.</p>

<h2><a name="coming">Of the Coming of Grey Star</a></h2>

<p>Ancient days they were when first the Shianti set foot upon the land that men call Magnamund. Long had they journeyed through the void, homeless wanderers in search of a place to call their own. And so it was that when the Shianti first looked upon the face of the land, their hearts were raised in wonder. They saw a world of nameless mountains, untamed forests, and lands both wild and free. Here they chose to cease their wanderings and to devote themselves to the study and appreciation of this newfound land.</p>
<p>To the delight of the Shianti, the race of man first emerged at this time and they watched his early struggle towards civilization with eager concern. Like gods, the Shianti seemed to the minds of primitive men. Tall and proud, shining with a radiance that spoke of magic and arcane mystery, the Shianti moved among them and with their powers of wizardry, aided man in his development.</p>
<p>As the centuries passed, man fell to worship of the magical Shianti and the power of these wizards grew even stronger. With hungry hearts they sought to unlock the mysteries of knowledge, sending their minds into other planes of existence and strange worlds beyond the sphere of the material plane. Their foresight was now unmatched and the power of their thought was mighty indeed. It was at this time that they created the Moonstone. Woven of the very fabric of the astral plane of Daziarn, this translucent gem was the greatest achievement of Shianti wisdom. It was the binding force of all Shianti magic, containing the combined might of all their wizardry, the sum of all their knowledge. The Golden Age of the Shianti had come and the Moonstone was the instrument of their dominion throughout all Magnamund. Man stood as little more than a shadow, blinded by the shining white light of Shianti glory. But, in creating the Moonstone, the unwritten laws of nature had been transgressed. For the Moonstone, like the Shianti themselves, was something outside of man’s own world; it defied the natural order laid down by the creators of Magnamund and disrupted the balance that the gods had designed.</p>
<p>The Goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon and mother of all men, showed herself to the Shianti and spoke to them of the destiny of man: ‘The children of this world must claim their inheritance. Their time has come and they must learn to stand alone. They are lost in their worship of you and the day draws ever nearer when they will covet the power of the Moonstone.’</p>
<p>And the Shianti said: ‘Forgive us, Great Goddess, for we intended no harm. We love mankind even as you do. We have sought to do good and protect your children from harm.’</p>
<p>But Ishir replied, ‘Of this there can be no doubt, but this world is not your realm. Man must be free to pursue his destiny alone, and you must leave, for you trespass on his domain.’</p>
<p>The Shianti were filled with sorrow. They feared a return to the void and to their lonely wandering, and pleaded with Ishir that she might allow them to remain. Ishir was filled with pity for them. She spoke again, saying, ‘If you are to remain, you must obey my command. You must take a vow never to interfere with mankind’s fate. As a token of good faith you must lay aside the Moonstone, and return it to the plane where it belongs.’</p>
<p>Solemnly, the Shianti agreed. The vow was sworn before Ishir, and the Moonstone was returned to the Daziarn. The Shianti then moved south to the Isle of Lorn. They encircled their new home with a web of enchantments, magical mists, and mage winds to prevent man from ever finding their place of refuge in the Sea of Dreams.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the Shianti faded with time, save in southern Magnamund where it became enshrined in legend, and the worship of them endured. Priests of the Shianti religion preserved their teachings and patiently awaited the day when the ‘ancient ones’ would return, bringing with them lasting peace and the blessing of a new golden age.</p>
<p>Two thousand years strode by and man advanced as Ishir had foretold. He built great cities and cultivated the land; his kingdoms rose and fell; he made war and loved and laughed and became master of his fate. But a new power was emerging in the province of Shadaki. There Shasarak the evil Wytch-king ruled. The black necromancer commanded an army of brutal soldiers and had a devoted following of men who upheld his religion of demonic worship and sacrificial rites. Devotees of the Shianti and other religious cults were persecuted in a merciless purge. Ruthlessly, the Wytch-king destroyed all his opponents and began a terrible war with the peoples of the neighbouring provinces. From the ruins of war Shasarak shaped the Shadakine Empire, subjugating whole nations to his evil rule. As the provinces fell to his might, the Shianti looked on helplessly, bound by their vow to the Goddess Ishir never to interfere in the affairs of man.</p>
<p>On the night of the crowning of Shasarak as Overlord of the Shadakine Empire, a great storm broke upon the Sea of Dreams, a storm that raged with unnatural intensity. Lashed by wind and rain, illuminated by wild lightning, the waters heaved and danced in fury to the thundering music of the storm, unchecked by even the enchantments of the Shianti. When finally the tempest died, the Shianti looked out in amazement on the shattered hull of a ship drifting towards their shore. Never before had this occurred, for the enchantments and mage winds had kept them secure from the curiosity of man by forcing him to sail close to his own land.</p>
<p>The Shianti went quickly to the ruined ship where they found only one survivor—a baby. They perceived the sudden arrival of this human child as a sign of great portent, and they conceived a plan by which they might lawfully aid mankind. They named the orphan child Grey Star, because a star is the symbol of hope in the Shianti faith, and because of the silver streak in the child’s jet-black hair. In the shadow of the wrath of the Goddess Ishir, they raised the child as one of their own and taught him their secrets. Diligently they set about their instruction, for their aim was to provide a saviour for mankind. Armed with the might of Shianti wizardry and wisdom, their hope was to create an adversary equal in power to the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki, for they realized that only with the death of Shasarak would man once more be free to determine his destiny.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Grey Star, trained in the ancient lore of a Shianti wizard. For sixteen years you have dwelt in safety on the Isle of Lorn, the hidden realm of the magical Shianti race, until Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, sent you upon a dangerous quest to save your people, the race of man, from the evil rule of Shasarak, the tyrannical Wytch-king of the Shadakine Empire. Held by their ancient vow to the Goddess Ishir, the Shianti are unable to leave their island and come to the aid of man themselves but no such promise prohibited you from leaving the island and you were sent to recover the Moonstone and use its power to defeat the Wytch-king.</p>
<p>The Moonstone, an artefact that possesses the combined force of all Shianti wisdom and power, was hidden on the Daziarn plane and you first had to find the invisible gateway to the Daziarn, the Shadow Gate. To help you find the Shadow Gate, you sought the Lost Tribe of Lara, a race of magical but primitive creatures called the Kundi, who possess the gift of astral vision, enabling them to see magic portals and gateways to other planes and dimensions. When Shasarak’s Shadakine army first invaded the free provinces of the south, they came through the forests of the Mountains of Lara where the Kundi lived, and were constantly ambushed and delayed by the Kundi. The Kundi always eluded them, disappearing into the dense forest before the Shadakine could retaliate and, finally, in wrath, the Wytch-king burnt down the forests and forced the Kundi to flee south. No one knew where they came to rest.</p>
<p>Voyaging across the Sea of Dreams, you came first to the city of Suhn, the largest port in the Shadakine Empire. There you were befriended by a cheerful merchant named Shan Li, a widely travelled man. Your questions about the Lost Tribe aroused suspicion in Suhn and you were captured and taken to the House of Correction, the prison of Suhn, and subjected to the truthsay of Mother Magri, Shadakine Wytch and Law-giver. With the aid of the power of the Kazim Stone, she attempted to read your mind, but you were able to preserve the secret of your quest.</p>
<p>With the help of Tanith, a young and beautiful girl learning the ways of wytchcraft in the service of Mother Magri, you were able to escape from the House of Correction. With Shan as your guide, you eventually turned south and headed towards the region known as the Azanam, for it seemed likely that the Lost Tribe had settled there. However, again using the power of the Kazim Stone, Mother Magri summoned a Kleasá against you—a demon shadow that feeds upon the soul. Neither your Magical Powers, nor the might of your Wizard’s Staff were able to defeat the Kleasá, and it had almost destroyed you when Tanith cast a spell and called the demon against herself. She was totally consumed by the Kleasá and both disappeared in flames. Her brave sacrifice saved your life.</p>
<p>At the Azanam you found the Kundi and they gave you their Shaman, Urik the Wise, to guide you to the Shadow Gate. You travelled across the hostile lands of the Shadakine Empire and, close to the gates of the city of Karnali, you freed a man named Samu, a former king of the extinct tribe of the Masbaté, from a Shadakine slave train. Then the leader of the rebel Freedom Guild, Sado of the Long Knife, enlisted your aid in freeing the city of Karnali from the rule of its Shadakine Wytch and her warriors, but you did not stay, for still you had to find the Shadow Gate. You journeyed on, accompanied by Samu, Urik, and a thief by the name of Hugi. On this later stage of your journey, you discovered that Shasarak was once a Shianti Master. So now you know your eventual confrontation will be with one versed in the same magical arts as yourself. You finally found the Shadow Gate beneath the wasteland of Desolation Valley, only to discover that the magic portal was guarded by a demon Kleasá, holding in its grasp Tanith, who had not after all been slain in her attempt to save you. Instead, the Kleasá had offered her to its master, Shasarak, as a prisoner. Using Tanith as a shield, the Kleasá withstood your attempts to gain entry to the Daziarn portal but at last you managed to force the Kleasá away from the Shadow Gate and stepped through to be reunited with Tanith.</p>
<p>Together you entered the Daziarn plane which held many mysteries and perils, the worst of which was the Jahksa, a creature created in your likeness by Shasarak. You travelled through this strange, abstract world until, at last, you came to the Trianon, a chamber floating in the void. Within the Trianon was the Moonstone and, after a last paradoxical confrontation with the Jahksa in which the lawful and magical effects of the Moonstone were used, the Jahksa was defeated and the Moonstone made yours.</p>
<p>With the Moonstone now resting in your hand, you begin the final part of your quest to defeat the Wytch-king. Armed with the might of the Moonstone, you now possess the only known power that can destroy Shasarak the renegade Shianti Wizard.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>To keep a record of your adventure, use the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Before you set off on your adventure, you must discover how well your Shianti masters have prepared you for your quest by determining your fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—your state of mind—<small>WILLPOWER</small>—and your physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. To do this take a pencil and, with eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The second number that you need is one to represent your <small>WILLPOWER</small>. Do not use the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. You begin this adventure with a <small>WILLPOWER</small> total of 50, as your first touch of the Moonstone of the Shianti regenerates your Magical Powers immediately. If you possess unused <small>WILLPOWER</small> points from earlier <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures, add them to the 50 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points which possession of the Moonstone grants you.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> Write the total in the <small>WILLPOWER</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you decide to use a spell or the power of your Wizard’s Staff, then you will lose <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. If at any time your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero, or below, you may not use any spells<sup><a href="#gamerulz-5-foot" name="gamerulz-5">3</a></sup> or any additional <small>WILLPOWER</small> points in combat to increase the <small>ENDURANCE</small> loss of an opponent.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-3-foot" name="gamerulz-3">4</a></sup> Lost <small>WILLPOWER</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure and it is possible for your <small>WILLPOWER</small> score to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p>The third attribute is your power of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. You start with a total of 30 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when your first touch of the Moonstone fills your body with energy and power. Add any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points gained from playing previous <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures to your initial score of 30 and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-4-foot" name="gamerulz-4">5</a></sup> If you are wounded in combat, you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure but can never rise above the number with which you began the adventure.</p>
<h3><a name="powers">Magical Powers</a></h3>

<p>There are thirteen Magical Powers, the first seven of which are called the Lesser Magicks. Possession of the Moonstone reveals to you the secret of the Magical Powers known as the Higher Magicks, of which there are six. If this is your first <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure, you may choose five Lesser Magicks and four Higher Magicks. If you have successfully completed any of the previous <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures, you may choose six Lesser Magicks and five Higher Magicks.<sup><a href="#powers-1-foot" name="powers-1">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The Magical Powers available to you are listed below. When you have chosen your powers enter them in the Magical Powers section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="122" width="386" src="sorcery.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Power allows a wizard to transform his thoughts or desires into magical energy. By concentration of the will it is possible to create magical shields of force to bar doors or move objects. Sorcery drains more <small>WILLPOWER</small> points than any other Magical Power, and is most effective when your <small>WILLPOWER</small> points are high.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Sorcery’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="enchant">Enchantment</a></h5>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="130" width="386" src="enchant.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others. He will be able to extract information from others, place thoughts and compulsions into another’s mind, or cause them to believe that imaginary events are actually taking place. Some magical or highly intelligent beings may be immune to the powers of Enchantment.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Enchantment’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="elementl">Elementalism</a></h5>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="118" width="386" src="elementl.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of elemental magic allows a wizard some control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth, and Water. By entering a trance and chanting incantations, you may summon aid from the spirits of the Elemental Plane. Elementals have very little understanding of man, and for this reason a wizard can never be sure of the nature of the aid the Elementals may send.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Elementalism’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="alchemy">Alchemy</a></h5>

Given the correct ingredients, a potion may restore lost energy (i.e. <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, <small>WILLPOWER</small>), or temporarily improve various abilities (e.g. <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>). The use of Alchemy may also allow a wizard to alter the nature of substances (e.g. change lead into gold), but the necessary ingredients and the correct equipment (e.g. a pestle and mortar) must be at hand. The use of the Power of Alchemy drains no <small>WILLPOWER</small>.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power write ‘Alchemy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="prophecy">Prophecy</a></h5>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="123" width="386" src="prophecy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The Power of Prophecy allows a wizard to foretell the future through meditation. A meditative state will allow a wizard to make the correct decision when facing conflicting choices or difficult actions; to discover the whereabouts of a person he has once met, or an object he has once seen. It may also allow him to determine the true nature of a stranger or a strange object. Magical beings or objects are sometimes hidden from the Power of Prophecy.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Prophecy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="psycmncy">Psychomancy</a></h5>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="126" width="386" src="psycmncy.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Power bestows upon a wizard the ability to deduce facts about events by touching objects connected to them. Through deep concentration, a wizard may lay his hands upon any inanimate object and visualize scenes that have affected it. Visions brought about through the use of Psychomancy are often cryptic, taking the form of a riddle or puzzle. Some magic items are resistant to the use of Psychomancy and may, sometimes, impart misleading information.</p>
<p>If you choose this Power, write ‘Psychomancy’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="evcation">Evocation</a></h5>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="131" width="386" src="evcation.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Mastery of this Power permits contact with the spirit realm. A wizard wishing to speak with the dead, or to call up a form from the spirit world, must draw a magic pentacle and enter a trance, when the use of the correct spell-chant will reach out to the Spiritual Plane. Standing within the protection of a magic pentacle, a wizard may consider himself to be relatively safe from harm. If he wishes to speak with a corpse, especially one whose former life was good and righteous, then a wizard can expect help and advice. However, contact with those whose former lives were evil or selfish can be a perilous, and often fatal, experience. Evil spirits are reluctant to return to the realm of the dead and may try to trick a wizard into freeing them into the world of the living. All spirits, good and evil, will require some service of the wizard in return for their aid. Any failure to perform this task, however difficult, may result in the wizard losing his life.</p>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="staff.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Your Staff is your most valuable possession. It looks and feels like an ordinary quarterstaff, yet it is stronger than any known metal. This is your main combat weapon, for you are untrained in the use of any other form of armed combat.

Every time you unleash this power you must deduct 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point.<sup><a href="#powers-2-foot" name="powers-2">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In the event that your enemy survives such an attack or should you fall victim to a surprise attack, you will be forced to engage in close combat and must attempt to strike your enemy with the Staff. If your attack is successful, a bolt of energy will be released from the Staff that is capable of inflicting great physical harm. If you wish to increase the amount of damage that you inflict in this way, you must use more <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and multiply the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by the enemy, accordingly. For example, if you chose to expend 3 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points on your attack, all enemy <small>ENDURANCE</small> point losses would be multiplied by three.</p>

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Grey Star’s aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Grey Star’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total, based on the weapon you are using. (Remember, if you enter combat without your Staff, you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points.)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">If you are using your Wizard’s Staff</a>, decide how many <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you wish to use. (Remember, you must expend at least 1 point.) Enter this number on your Combat Record in the box marked <small>WILLPOWER</small>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Grey Star (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15, <small>WILLPOWER</small> 23) is ambushed by a Deathgaunt (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but he can use his Wizard’s Staff against the creature as it swoops down on him. He subtracts the Deathgaunt’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −5. (15 − 20 = −5). −5 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio. Grey Star decides to use 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, which is noted on the <small>WILLPOWER</small> box of the Combat Record.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>When you have decided upon the number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you wish to use and have determined your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked. (The random numbers appear on the side of the chart.) You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by Grey Star. To calculate the number lost by the enemy, multiply the number listed for the enemy by the number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points that Grey Star elected to use. Now you have the final number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Grey Star and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GS represents points lost by Grey Star.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Grey Star and the Deathgaunt has been established as −5, and Grey Star’s <small>WILLPOWER</small> points used as 2. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
Grey Star loses 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.<br /><br />
Deathgaunt loses 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, multiplied by 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, giving a total of 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in all.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat, and Grey Star’s amended <small>WILLPOWER</small> points total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Grey Star are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Grey Star is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Grey Star proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> and <small>WILLPOWER</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Grey Star may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="sage">Sage Advice</a></h2>

<p>Now begins the last and most dangerous stage of your quest to vanquish the Wytch-king, Shasarak. Beware, for you must face many dangers before you are able to confront him at last.</p>
<p>You will find items that might be of assistance on your quest. Some Special Items will help you, others may be of no use at all. You must decide what to keep.</p>
<p>Special care must be taken when selecting your Magical Powers. Make sure that your combination of Higher and Lesser Magicks covers every eventuality. Also, it is worth remembering that some of these Magical Powers will be of little use to you during this part of your quest: choose the Powers you think you are most likely to require at this stage.</p>
<p>Be cautious in your use of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, as your <small>WILLPOWER</small> is the energy source for both your Magical Powers and your Wizard’s Staff. If you have a low <small>WILLPOWER</small> score when you confront Shasarak, you may be easily defeated.</p>

<p>At last you hold the fabled Moonstone in your hand. It pulses and glows with a strange milky light. Tanith’s eyes shine wildly, and your heart pounds with excitement. The Moonstone; ancient vessel of all Shianti wisdom. What secrets, what powers, does this magical artefact hold in its glowing heart? The stone exudes a comforting warmth as it nestles in the palm of your hand and you feel a presence in your mind. You hear a familiar voice and your heart lifts to ever greater heights, for it is Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, speaking to you.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="641" width="386" src="ill1.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration I</strong>—At last you hold the fabled Moonstone in your hand.
<br /><br /></div><p>‘Hail Wizard, son of man. You have succeeded. We, the Shianti, rejoice and praise you. That which you hold in your hand contains the power that will enable you to defeat the evil Wytch-king, Shasarak.’</p>
<p>A crowd of excited voices fills your mind as each of the Shianti sends words of congratulations and admiration. The last of these voices is Maiteya, your old friend, the Shianti master who taught you all you know. ‘And so, “little one”,’ he says, affectionately ‘now you possess the Moonstone, Shasarak’s bane. While you hold it, we, the Shianti, are able to speak with you but this communication cannot be maintained much longer. Because you have the Moonstone, we have sufficient power to return you to the world, but there is much you should know before we do so. Listen well, Grey Star, for I know not when we will speak again.</p>
<p>‘Though it seems to you but a short time since you arrived at the Daziarn, seven years have passed here in the material world. During your search for the Shadow Gate, you visited the city of Karnali. Your arrival there inspired a revolution, led by Sado of the Long Knife and his Army of the Freedom Guild. After your departure, the Freedom Guild withstood a great siege by Shadakine warriors, who eventually withdrew defeated, much to Shasarak’s displeasure. Word spread of this victory and the strength of the Army of the Freedom Guild grew. Strategically, Karnali was too isolated to make a great impact against the Shadakine Empire, but, due to the surrounding Gurlu Marshes, it remained self sufficient. Soon, many were travelling to Karnali to escape the tyranny of Shasarak’s rule. Pockets of resistance broke out in the townships of Wenat, Zhanis, Sena, and the city of Forlu, and the Freedom Guild soon dominated the hills and the plains of the south. They raided Shadakine supply trains and succeeded in depriving the empire of much of its wealth, cutting off all land routes to the Port of Suhn, the wealthiest and most important trade centre of the empire. An army is now formed in Karnali and, in three days, it will march against the Shadakine Empire, hoping to take Port Suhn in the first of many conquests. But, unknown to Sado and the Army of the Freedom Guild, a vast Shadakine force has been mustered in the Sadi desert. Soon, it will march against them. The Army of the Freedom Guild number ten thousand to the Shadakine’s thirty thousand. The Freedom Guild cannot hope to succeed against such overwhelming odds. You must save them. Take them to the Forest of Fernmost. It is most important that you go there. There is little time and much to do Grey Star…’</p>
<p>The voice grows faint and you realize that the Shianti will be unable to maintain contact for much longer. ‘And now, Grey Star, the contact breaks and we must return you to the world to begin the last of your great labours. Are there any last words of advice we can offer you?’</p>

<p>You triumph and, with a last surge of energy, throw Shasarak tumbling to the end of the hall. Unfortunately the force of the attack shatters your Staff. On hands and knees, Shasarak crawls towards the wall of fire, muttering in choked breaths, ‘You shall not have me. You shall not have me.’</p>

<p>Following the direction of her gaze, you see something stirring in the distance. You notice a low dust haze hanging in the air, a running cloud drifting against the flat expanse of the plain. There are four runners and they are heading straight towards you. As they come closer, you are able to see that they are ghastly, malformed creatures, each deformed in a different way. These are demons, summoned long ago by the Wytch-king, Shasarak, to plague the tribe of the Masbaté, the warrior people that ruled here before Shasarak unleashed the demonic horde that destroyed them. When the demons had fulfilled their purpose, Shasarak left them to roam these plains at will, instead of returning them to the deep hell from which he summoned them.

<p>Stunned and dizzy, you lie on the floor, unable to defend yourself. The Demon Master hovers above, its leathery wings beating. It stoops to deliver a killing blow. Bravely Tanith steps forward, dagger in hand, ready to defend you to the last. The demon minions swarm forward in glee and the position looks hopeless. Then, amid the whirl of your thoughts, you hear the cries of men and the clash of steel. Joyfully you see a gleam of shining metal flash above your head and the Demon Master’s back arch with pain. Howling in agony it begins to fall. With lightning reactions, Tanith drags you to one side, seconds before the lifeless and bloody corpse of the beast hits the ground with a jarring crash. A long, slim javelin protrudes from its back.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star,’ Tanith cries. ‘We are saved!’</p>

<p>Bathed in the radiant aura of the Moonstone’s protection, you continue the journey east. You top a rise and look down its gentle slope. Ahead, you can see a sparkling river. With a cry of joy, you and Tanith run towards it. At the water’s edge you both drop to your knees to drink. Scooping up great mouthfuls of the cool water, you quench your raging thirst. You are on the banks of the Dolani River. Tanith tells you that its source is to the northeast, in the Kashima Mountains. Its southerly course leads to Lake Dolani, which she guesses to be at least thirty miles away. The river is too wide and deep to be crossed here, although it is likely to be narrower and shallower further upstream. At this point the light of the Moonstone, which you laid on the ground beside you before beginning to drink, starts to flicker as the power of your incantation fades. Suddenly Tanith cries out.</p>

As you watch, they rush towards you, coming to a cowering halt within twenty paces of you both. Afraid of the fading aura of the Moonstone as the light decreases, each takes another shambling step towards you. They are ghastly, malformed creatures, each with a different misshapen form. These are demons summoned long ago by the Wytch-king Shasarak to conquer the people who once inhabited the Lissan Plain. Having fulfilled their purpose, they were left to roam the plain by Shasarak.

<p>You both drink long and deep: the large bowl is almost empty before your thirst is sated. When you have finished you walk to the far end of the hall. Two flights of stairs lead up to a large platform. At the rear of the platform a vast and elaborate frieze has been carved from the wall. In the centre, a woman stands with arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome. She is wreathed in light and, standing all around her, are rows of men and women of proud bearing. This building must be the work of the Masbaté. The woman is a representation of the Great goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon, mother of all men, and the building is some form of temple or shrine.</p>
<p>Another flight of steps leads from the platform to one of the many galleries that line the temple’s walls. Cautiously you both mount these steps, passing through a doorway that opens on to one of the galleries. The fading light from above does not illuminate the high archways that lead off the gallery, and, at the cost of 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point, you cause a light to glow from the top of your Staff. You peer through an archway to see a large chamber, its high ceiling lost in shadow, its corners shrouded in cobwebs. In the middle of the chamber stands a long pallet of grime-encrusted marble. With a start, you realize that a human form rests upon the pallet, but your panic soon subsides, for it is a dead man, a giant, with a huge broadsword clutched to his chest with withered hands. A necklace of blue stones hangs around his neck; a circlet of silver crowns his head. The brown, shrunken flesh has been partly preserved by some process of mummification, but the garments the corpse wears have all but mouldered away.</p>
<p>Inspection of the remaining chambers on this floor confirms that this is an ancient Masbaté tomb. Each chamber is a crypt, in which the Masbaté have laid their dead to rest with their weapons of war and personal effects. The tomb of the Masbaté was probably served by guardians before Shasarak summoned the plague of demons that eventually destroyed the Masbaté tribe. Tanith arms herself with a long dagger from one of the chambers. She also takes a sling and a number of stones. You may keep any of the following items that you find in the various chambers:</p>

<p>‘You will need to be able to move fast to escape the demon horde,’ says Samu. ‘Long ago, we of the Masbaté bred a strain of horse called the Simar, renowned for its stamina and the ease with which it can be controlled. It will not shy away from danger.’</p>
<p>A great white stallion is brought before you, harnessed and saddled. Gratefully, you thank Samu for his gift. The Masbaté are summoned and stand fitted and accoutred for battle before their king in a rocky escarpment shaped like a vast amphitheatre. They number a thousand men: a small number perhaps, but a mighty army nevertheless, for the Masbaté are formidable warriors. In a rousing speech, Samu tells them of the battle to come at the bridge at Lanzi, where you will rid their homeland of the demon plague forever. You receive a great cheer before Samu leads his people out of the mountains, towards Lanzi. A guide leads you to the other side of the mountains.

<p>Your vision clears and, as you regain your senses, you see that the warriors are men of the Masbaté, the tribe believed to be extinct after persecution by the Wytch-king, Shasarak. With a flurry of sword blows, the Masbaté hew a bloody path towards you. Though they number less than fifty, their demonic foes seem powerless to resist, so swift and fierce is the attack. The demon horde scatters in all directions. Some dematerialize—magic is inherent in their nature. Those that remain are slain mercilessly.</p>
<p>When at last the battle is done, no living demon remains in the tomb, while, incredibly, the Masbaté have suffered no losses, only a scattering of light wounds. One of their number now stands before you. Like his comrades, the Masbaté warrior stands well over seven feet tall, his body rippling with muscle beneath skin as black as ebony. His hair is long and black and his eyes still burn with the fire of battle. He is clad only in a corselet of worn, padded leather. A scabbard slung low from a broad belt carries a massive broadsword of dull, grey metal. His only protective wear, a pair of metal wristbands, is engraved with the intricately worked design of a rearing horse. He gives you a speculative stare. It is not an altogether friendly gaze.</p>
<p>‘What do we have here?’ he booms, in a strong, yet melodious bass tone. ‘A boy and a girl perhaps? Or demons in human guise, defilers of the sacred tomb of our forefathers. Speak now and swiftly. My blade is thirsty yet to drink the blood of more hellspawn.’</p>
<p>Before you are able to speak, Tanith has risen to her feet, brandishing her dagger and scowling with the characteristic ferocity that you have come to know so well. ‘You know not what you say,’ she snaps, menace in her voice. ‘But for that, this blade of mine would have your life for such insult to one who comes to save your brawny, worthless hide. Soften your tone, tall one, for you speak to a mighty wizard, a master of great powers, the chosen one of the great ancient Shianti. He has come to challenge the Wytch-king himself, who is surely the enemy of us all.’</p>
<p>Despite her slight frame and her puny blade, Tanith confronts the warrior with an icy countenance that would freeze blood. Though he towers over her like a giant, the warrior steps back, mouth agape in astonishment at her fearless outburst. He is stunned into silence. The barely suppressed mirth of the other Masbaté is plain to see.</p>
<p>‘Ho there, Dioka!’ shouts a squat Masbaté, with a bellowing laugh that makes his pot-belly quiver and shake. ‘It’s a spitting she-cat that’s stolen your tongue I see.’</p>
<p>‘And the cat has claws, bladder belly!’ she snaps. The plump warrior’s face drops, while the one named Dioka bursts into laughter. ‘Well met, my lady,’ he guffaws.</p>
<p>With a bemused expression, you rise on shaky feet and turn to Dioka. ‘Greetings, men of the Masbaté,’ you call out in a loud voice, ensuring that all can hear. ‘Plainly we are not agents of evil in mortal guise.’</p>
<p>‘Indeed not,’ Dioka replies with a smile. ‘The very demons of the plain would flee the wrath of your brave companion’s acid tongue!’</p>
<p>‘Yet, in her anger she spoke the truth,’ you continue. ‘For I am the Wizard, Grey Star, bound upon a quest in the service of the Shianti and sworn to the destruction of the Wytch-king, Shasarak.’ The vast hall grows silent. Wide-eyed, the Masbaté regard you with stunned expressions.</p>
<p>‘Can this be?’ Dioka gasps, a gleam of hope shining in his dark, deep eyes. ‘We will talk of this at length and in the proper place,’ he continues. ‘You must come with us. It is not wise to remain here. The demons may return and in greater numbers. Most likely they will be led by more formidable masters than this,’ he gestures dismissively towards the corpse of the Demon master that sprawls on the floor a few feet away. ‘The home of the Masbaté now lies in the Kashima Mountains, beyond the River Iss. The king must hear of your return.’</p>
<p>The Masbaté restore the bodies of their ancient dead to their resting places. A funeral pyre for the slain demons is built outside the walls of the tomb, and with considerable effort and over many hours, they are able to repair the stone door. While they work, your wounds are attended to and you and Tanith are given food and water. There is a gifted healer among them and he is able to restore to you 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. (Amend your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.) It is late afternoon before the Masbaté are ready to leave. Struggling to keep pace with the rapid march of the warriors, you head into the lengthening shadows, toward the distant mountains: the secret lair of the last of a proud and mighty race.</p>

<p>Suddenly you are in a wide, round hall, full of shadows. At one end of the hall is a flaming wall, and kneeling before the wall is the hunched figure of Shasarak, Wytch-king of Shadaki. His back is turned to you but he spins round the instant you arrive. He is a hideous sight. His flesh is black as if burnt by recent fires and his fingers are like claws. Half his face is missing, and in its place there is a metal plate, which is the only thing that gives shape to a livid mass of shrunken flesh and tissue. One eye is shrivelled, sightless, and shrunken, the other burns into you with hatred so intense that it almost forces you back a step.</p>

<p>‘See, Shasarak. He has come, as I told you he would. He has come to slay you. Won’t you accept my bargain?’</p>
<p><em>‘Never!’</em> Shasarak hisses, his voice like the rush of broken stone scattering on the floor. ‘He does not have the power to master me…as you have not, Demon.’</p>

<p>Though you handle the branches of the plant delicately, you cannot avoid disturbing it and many of the pods squirt jets of purple fluid. Fortunately, many miss you.

<p>With the speed of a pouncing tiger, you twist around to face the three that remain. They are almost upon you, but the speed of your reactions and the fierceness of your gaze paralyse the grotesque creatures. With a mighty cry, you hurl yourself at them in a wild blaze of magical fire and slashing blows. At the cost of 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point, your Staff crashes down on the head of the nearest demon. It falls to the ground with a squeal of pain, smoke curling around its purple body that shines like the shell of a giant beetle. It reaches at you with a feeble motion, its crab-like pincer flexing stiffly before it dies. Those that remain flee as fast as their distorted limbs can carry them, wailing in a frenzy of insane fear. You start to pursue, but before you can reach them they have dematerialized. You turn around: the injured toad demon has also disappeared. Panting heavily, you satisfy yourself that Tanith is unharmed before dropping your guard. You fall to your knees, drawing great breaths and leaning heavily on your Staff.</p>

<p>Other dots appear high on the horizon. Approaching at an alarming speed are a multitude of strange and sinister creatures. You count twenty at least. A familiar sound greets your ears: the babbling frenzy of the demon horde close behind you. There is no time to prepare magical spells, nor is there anywhere to hide, and the forest pass must be at least twenty miles away.

<p>You come to the top of a small rise. Peering over the edge, you see that the ground slopes away in a long, shallow curve, which rises on every side to form a broad basin. At the centre lies a large lake many miles wide. Feverishly you lick your lips in anticipation of a long, languorous drink of cool water. You start to move down the slope when Tanith catches your arm.</p>
<p>‘Wait!’ she says. ‘I can see something down there.’</p>
<p>You follow the line of her finger. Among the verdant grassland of the depression that surrounds what must be Lake Dolani you can just make out a human form. You edge a few more feet down the slope. With horror you see a large man lying with his arms and legs tied to four wooden stakes driven into the ground. A faint moan drifts on the breeze: he is calling for water. You edge a little closer. The man is almost a giant, measuring at least seven feet tall. His skin is black as ebony and his hair is long and flowing. Suddenly you realize that this is one of the Masbaté, the original inhabitants of the Lissan Plain and a mighty warrior people—till Shasarak defeated them in the Plains War of MS 5008.</p>
<p>You have only known one Masbaté: Samu, a noble and fearless warrior, who accompanied you in your search for the Moonstone. Once, he was king of the Masbaté nomads. He thought himself the only survivor of his people—it was common belief that the Wytch-king had hounded the tribe into extinction, sealing their doom by unleashing a plague of demons. Some say that these demons roam the plains still.</p>
<p>You wonder who has left the poor, tortured man to die in the sun. You step further down the slope intending to free him, but Tanith holds you back, fearing a trap. You cannot see how anyone, even Shasarak himself, could know that you have returned to the lands of the Shadakine Empire after an absence of seven years.</p>

The light of the Moonstone dwindles and, with the fading of its light, the demon horde swarms out of the valley of fear. You are dragged from your steed and delivered as an offering to the unknown power that dwells on the other side of the portal. It drinks your soul with a hideous cackle of triumph.</p>

<p>High in the afternoon sky you see two black specks wheeling above you. As you walk, one of them begins to spiral downwards. It is a long, snake-like creature with broad, feathery wings. Its talons are like small, clutching needles and it has a small set of forelimbs. The other creature follows and, to your surprise, you see that it is exactly the same as the first, only smaller. That these are plague demons is certain, but it is the first time you have ever seen two of the same kind. The Flying Snakes make no move towards you; they merely drift on the air currents.

The walls of the circular chamber shimmer in and out of focus: the Shianti are transporting you from the Daziarn plane to the real world. A brilliant flash of light fills the room and you close your eyes involuntarily. When you next open them you look upon a vast plain of grass that undulates like the sea beneath a clear, sunlit sky.

Gibbering with fear, they shield their eyes from its pure, white light and back away, stumbling over one another. The sea of deformity parts like a tall swathe of grass to let you pass. Resolutely you stare ahead ignoring the hideous mass of malignancy that surrounds you; nothing must distract your gaze as you focus on the flaming archway that draws nearer with each tentative step of the stallion’s hooves.

Moving along the base of a line of mountains is a monstrous horde of deformity: the demon plague. Each of the creatures has a different but equally misshapen form: weird toad beasts, their green hides glistening, crawl and flop along the ground; stumbling apes with stunted limbs shamble beside creeping reptiles with human heads. You are sure the demon plague is very near and you sweep the land once more, tracing the line of a river that fills a lake similar to Lake Dolani: this must be Lake Iss. Another group comes into view.

<p>With a last, painful effort you hurtle through the brush and undergrowth at the edge of the forest. Using the cover of the forest you soon leave the horde struggling behind you. Stumbling with fatigue, your robe tattered and torn, your body bleeding from a dozen small wounds, you tramp through the densely packed vegetation. At last you find a hidden glade and you stop to rest for a moment.</p>

<p>With a wide, scything stroke of your Staff, the demon is slain. Its ruined body crumples to the ground, staining the grass of the plain with thick, black blood. Suddenly a razor-sharp pincer grabs your arm, raking your shoulder to inflict a bloody wound (you lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). The other three demons have crept up on you while you fought. Your attacker is the smallest of the three: a grotesque creature with an impossibly bent back and a bulbous purple body, shining like the shell of some gigantic beetle. With a cacophony of triumphal screeches they throw themselves at you. You cannot evade and must fight them to the death. All three fight as one enemy.</p>

Flinching at the Moonstone’s light they back away. The power of your incantation is beginning to fade now but you feel sure that the horde is sufficiently frightened to allow you and Tanith to pass.

Instead the creature howls in pain and clutches at its clawed hand, hurt from the impact of your iron flesh. The remaining demons make similar attempts to harm you, all with the same result. When all their efforts have proved futile they begin to back away, cowering with fear beneath the intensity of your unflinching gaze. Impressive as this power is, it has cost you 4 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points.

You lift your Staff to strike the creature once more as it faces you with small, red eyes that stare malevolently. You swing your Staff but you strike nothing. The demon has vanished leaving only the echo of its tormented scream and the stench of its acrid breath. The three remaining demons advance slowly towards you, gibbering with obscene delight. Using the momentum of your swinging stroke at the toad demon, you spin round to face the three hideous creatures in one fluid movement. They falter, and then step back in fear, clinging to each other and shrieking. Suddenly Tanith shouts a warning. There is something close behind you.

You and Tanith do the same, quenching your day-old thirst with relish.</p>
<p>The Masbaté’s name is Kuna. He tells you that he was captured while fishing alone on the banks of the Dolani River, by a number of the demons that still roam the Lissan Plain. He has lain bound since that time.</p>

<p>The steady croon of hellish voices grows as the evil horde gloats at the utter hopelessness of your position. You are enclosed by a force that numbers almost a hundred. With a terrible cry, a pack of demons rushes towards you. Each of the creatures has a different but equally misshapen form.

You break into a run and do not stop until you have reached the banks of its fast-flowing waters. Hurriedly, you scoop handfuls of water into your mouth, and do not stop until your parched throat is soothed and your thirst quenched. With a satisfied expression, Tanith sits up on her haunches, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.</p>
<p>‘This is the River Dolani,’ she says. ‘It leads south, to fill the great Lake Dolani thirty miles downstream. Upstream, to the northeast, is its source in the Kashima Mountains.’</p>

<p>A dazzling whirl of deadly strokes from your Staff fells the grisly creature at last. All around you hear the sound of battle as the brave Masbaté challenge the malevolent fury of the demon horde. The warriors are superb fighters and the demon ranks are soon thrown into disarray. Some of the demons dematerialize by magical means. Those that do not are swiftly slain by the fierce Masbaté.</p>
<p>At last the battle is over: no demons remain alive. To your amazement, the Masbaté have suffered no casualties, though they number only fifty men. Sheathing his long broadsword, one of their number walks towards you. Far off in the distance, you see that the Masbaté man who lay tethered by the lake has been released and a few of his brother warriors are helping him up the slope.</p>

<p>Drawing out the Moonstone, you focus all the power of your will onto it and concentrate on the demon portal. A moan ripples through the ranks in the valley below, turning into a chorus of fierce, inhuman cries. Suddenly the portal erupts into an intense blaze of swirling, writhing flame. A large pair of eyes appear in the flames of the portal and a deathly voice speaks. Your Simar steed whinnies in fear, rears up, its hooves flashing in the sun and then bolts, hurtling at high speed away from you. The demon horde sweep up the side of the shallow valley in their hundreds and attack. Without your horse, you have no hope of evading them and, after a long, valiant fight in which many demons fall, you are dragged to the ground and slain.</p>

Slowly, lazily, as if awakening from a deep sleep, they open revealing two great pools of impenetrable darkness; vast, eddying whorls of eternal shadow. The eyes beckon with a hypnotic stare, a cloaked welcome to hell’s darkest and most desolate chamber.</p>

Savage laughter rings in your ears. ‘Can this be?’ the voice crows, scornfully. ‘Oh! but this is the sweetest, the richest, of ironies. It is the Shianti slave, is it not? Upon the errand of fools, treading the path of the foolish? And that worthless bauble of theirs, you have found it? Yes, I see that you have.’</p>

<p>‘My brothers; they come,’ shouts Kuna. ‘We are saved.’</p>
<p>Cresting the rise is a long line of tall, black-skinned warriors: men of the Masbaté. They send up a loud cry before releasing a volley of javelins into the rear ranks of the demon horde, killing many. The demons are thrown into disarray. Their anguished screams echo throughout the basin as the Masbaté charge down the slope with their swords drawn. The two forces collide and a short but bloody battle ensues. Many of the demons vanish magically. Those that remain are mercilessly slain. When the battle is over, a Masbaté warrior sheathes his sword and walks towards you.</p>

A single yellow eye looks out from the centre of a broad, furrowed forehead, crested with many long feelers like antennae. The demon emits a moan of displeasure on finding the chamber empty and turns to leave. You give a quiet sigh of relief and suddenly the demon halts and begins to sniff the air, head cocked to one side with a quizzical gesture.

<p>Your heart pounding, you wait as the gibbering, snarling creatures approach. As they draw closer, they move more slowly until finally they lapse into a cowering, nervous creep. Your stand obviously intimidates them, for although you are gripped with fear, you display a confident menace. Suddenly they fall upon you in a wild, slavering flurry of kicks, blows, and bites.</p>

<p>The Demon Master is weakening. Suddenly, in a desperate bid to escape the dazzling blur of magical flame that wreathes its body, it spreads its wings, and attempts to fly out of range. In that instant you swing a tremendous blow at the monster’s heart. With a terrible roar, it convulses in mid-air, arms flung out and clawed fists clenched with pain. It drops like a rock. Before you are able to dodge aside, the creature’s body falls directly on top of you, hurling you to the ground with terrific force. You lose hold of your Wizard’s Staff and it clatters on the stone floor, just out of reach. You try to drag yourself from under the dead weight of the Demon Master but, dazed and confused by the fall, you are unable to scramble free.</p>
<p>Tanith rushes forward to grab your Staff. As she does, the demon minions that surround you let out a pealing cry of crazed glee and surge forward. Tanith manages to pick up the Staff before being forced to back away. She holds her dagger before her in readiness but against so many she cannot hope to prevail. Slowly she edges towards you. The Staff is tantalizingly out of reach. Tanith dares not turn her back on the advancing horde to give it to you. The position looks hopeless. Then, amid the whirl of your thoughts, you hear the cries of human voices and the clash of steel. You turn to look in the direction of the sound. Pouring through the entrance of the tomb comes a mass of tall warriors, swords bared, reaping a deadly harvest amongst the demonic ranks.</p>

<p>With a whirl of colour, you find yourself in a long, grey hall. You guess that you are close to Shasarak for at the far end of the hall you see a door engraved with a large Shianti rune representing Shasarak’s name. Guarding that door is a grotesque creature, a servant of Shasarak. It is a demon, summoned from some ghastly netherworld that only the dark sorceries of Shasarak could reach. The demon has a high, humped back and a square, flat face that bears two blank, emotionless eyes, colourless and entirely lacking in any warmth or feeling, like pebbles by an unknown sea.</p>
<p>‘Hail, enemy of my master,’ it breathes. ‘I have waited for you. My master told me you would come.’</p>
<p>You step closer. With some concern you see that the demon has affected the shape of a man, with blonde, gilded hair. You tell yourself that this is no man, but a demon in human guise. The demon stands tall; it mocks. ‘Why have you delayed? What are your reasons? I have waited so long…so long to meet your challenge. I am powerful; I am mighty! Know you, that I am the Ipagé, greatest of all demons under my master’s command. My power is that of hate, for indeed I hate you, free and unstained as you are, unheeding of the powers that I and my master hold most dear.’</p>
<p>The creature’s tirade of scorn is unrelenting and, to you, quite meaningless. It does not hate you, but what you represent: the wild, free, unrestrained wisdom of the Shianti. Shasarak has taught it that this wisdom is meaningless. You know that this is a wisdom, not born of knowledge, but of the freedom of the spirit, of the soul to follow its own way, sure that a mind without hate or resentment can do no harm. The Ipagé hisses like a serpent as you approach. You notice that its body is transparent and shimmers with an eerie light. The door to Shasarak’s chamber lies directly behind this evil guardian. So far it has made no attack.</p>

He lands with a sickening thud on top of his fellows, sending them sprawling to the ground.</p>

<p>The night passes without incident but you are wakened at dawn by the sounds of scratching and scrabbling from below. The sinister murmuring of distant voices echoes ominously throughout the vast hall and the hair on the back of your neck prickles with fear at the sound of a low, bestial moan, alien and chilling. Tanith wakes with a nervous start. Sensibly she says nothing, but her dagger is in her hands in a moment, her eyes flashing dangerously, her body taut. Slowly you edge out of the chamber and peer through the supporting columns of the balcony. In the golden glow of the dawn light that creeps through the shafts of the roof, you are confronted by a nightmarish vision.</p>
<p>The floor of the ziggurat is a heaving carpet of horror. A swarm of hideous creatures lurks there, gibbering insanely. Each wears a different and equally misshapen guise: toad beasts, their green hides glistening, crawl beside stunted anthropoids with matted fur and scabby flesh; creeping reptiles with human heads vie with many-limbed crustaceans; lurching serpents slither upon the backs of hulking beetles. Never before have you seen such a ghastly horde of evil deformity.</p>
<p>‘The demon plague,’ hisses Tanith, horrified. ‘Such was the evil that defeated the brave Masbaté. Who could stand against such fearful monstrosity?’</p>
<p>The shuffling column reaches the foot of the stairs. With every passing moment more are entering the ziggurat through the gateway that you yourself opened but could not close. Now it is you that must attempt to stand against the demon plague. Five floors below, a terrifying doom approaches. The demons advance, slowly, cautiously, unsure of their new environment. Certainly, they are unaware of your presence in the highest gallery of the ancient Masbaté tomb. You have little time in which to plan an escape.</p>

<br /><br /></div><p>You stand, Staff held aloft, ready for combat. ‘Who calls?’ you call into the darkness. There is no answer but soon you are able to discern a tall figure, standing upright in a large, wooden rowing boat. He draws closer and, to your amazement, you find yourself looking upon a giant of a man, perhaps seven or more feet tall with long, flowing hair and skin as black as ebony. You realize that this man is a Masbaté warrior, member of the tribe believed by all to be extinct.</p>
<p>‘I witnessed your struggle with the demons from the shore,’ he says. ‘Come, more are sure to return soon, and in greater numbers. You must come with me. You are not safe on this side of the river.’</p>
<p>You and Tanith clamber aboard the boat and, with strong strokes, the warrior rows you to the other side of the river. There, a great host of Masbaté warriors waits. You can hardly believe your good fortune at this timely rescue or that members of the great Masbaté people still exist. You have only ever known one Masbaté: Samu, a noble and fearless warrior, who accompanied you on your search for the Moonstone. Once he was king of the Masbaté nomads but he thought himself the only survivor of his people. Everyone believed that the Wytch-king, Shasarak, hounded them into extinction, sealing their doom with the unleashing of the demon plague.</p>
<p>‘I am Dioka,’ says the man who has rowed you ashore. ‘I am leader of the warrior band that patrols the banks of the river in the defence of the Masbaté. Who are you?’</p>
<p>You regard the Masbaté host with a joyful expression. ‘Greetings, men of the Masbaté,’ you call, ensuring that all can hear. ‘I am the Wizard, Grey Star, bound upon a quest in the service of the Shianti and sworn to the destruction of the Wytch-king, Shasarak.’</p>
<p>Wide-eyed, the Masbaté regard you with stunned expressions. ‘Can this be?’ Dioka gasps, shaking his head in disbelief. ‘If this is true, then you must tell the king. Will you accompany us to the Kashima Mountains, where we of the Masbaté now dwell?’</p>
<p>You nod your agreement. ‘Then come.’</p>

Unable to prevent the domination of their minds, they have fled, using their own magical powers. You are safe. The spell has cost you 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points.</p>

With a deadly flash of steel, Tanith fells one of the beasts with her dagger, and, at the cost of 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point, you deliver a powerful blow that sends another crashing to the ground. You reach the doorway of the crypt. The demons are running in the opposite direction, heading for the stairs that lead back down to the hall.

Swords drawn, the Masbaté sprint past. You and Tanith are swept along by the momentum of their charge and into the throes of a bloody battle. You almost collide with a hunched, ape-like creature with four arms and a long tail. You cannot avoid combat and must fight to the death.</p>

Suddenly many balls of flame arc through the air above the heads of the men of the Freedom Guild to fall into the trees behind.</p>
<p>‘Hah!’ Sado shouts. ‘The fools are way off target.’</p>

You move at great speed, faster than the confused mass that seeks you out, and you cover the mile in a short time, thundering to a halt at the other end of the valley where the portal burns halfway down the slope.</p>

This flowering shrub, also known to some as Dragonkiss, grows round the base of rocks and stones, taking root in the damp soil beneath. The name Dragonkiss comes from the plant’s curious, perilous flowers. Each flower is a semi-transparent pod and its colour comes from the potent, purple acid within each one. If the main plant is disturbed the pods may squirt a stinging jet of acid, capable of inflicting a painful burn. If the pods can be plucked carefully from the main plant, without disturbing the main plant, the acid can be preserved and used at a later date.

The separate threads of the story fall into place as the ancient plans of the Shianti finally come to fruition. You draw out the Moonstone. Though you have not exerted any power upon it, it is shining with a blinding white light of its own. The seven Kazim roar with pleasure as the rays of the Moonstone touch their rocky bodies, and then they begin to move, stretching their craggy limbs after centuries of sleep.</p>
<p>One of the Kazim speaks to you. ‘We thank you,’ it says. ‘But you must go now, back to your people. Their enemy approaches, bringing with them an enemy of ours. We will come soon, when we are fully ready and restored to life. Hurry. Battle begins.’</p>
<p>In the distance you can hear the sound of many voices shouting. The Shadakine must have attacked by night. You whirl around and dash down the hill, heading towards the sound of battle.</p>

<p>The night has grown old before you arrive at the torchlit entrance to a cave in the Kashima Mountains. Dioka leads you through a maze of winding passageways in the rock and eventually you come to a wide cavern. At the far end of the cavern, mounted on a rough-hewn dais of stone is a large throne. Sat upon the throne is the Masbaté king deep in thought, his hand cupping his broad jaw. Suddenly your heart lifts. You recognize this man!</p>
<p>‘My lord,’ Dioka begins. The king lifts his great head. ‘May I present!’</p>
<p>But the sentence is never finished, for the king is none other than Samu himself. ‘Grey Star!’ he cries, rising to his feet. ‘You live!’</p>
<p>Before you can speak a word, King Samu leaps from the stone dais and bounds towards you, sweeping you up in a bone-crunching embrace. ‘Seven years, Grey Star,’ he booms. ‘Seven years since last we stood together. We thought that you perished long ago, deep in the caverns of Desolation Valley. What became of your search for the Shadow Gate of the Daziarn—did you succeed after all? Did you find the Moonstone of the Shianti? What has happened since you stepped upon the wasted lands beyond the Lissan Mountains?’</p>
<p>He hugs you once again, squeezing the air from your lungs. When you have regained sufficient breath to speak, you explain what has happened to you since you were separated, and of how the passage of time runs differently on the Daziarn Plane. ‘I have but recently returned,’ you say. ‘And behold!’ You draw out the Moonstone. ‘I succeeded. Look you upon Shasarak’s bane—the Moonstone of the Shianti.’</p>
<p>A great noise fills the hall as the Masbaté warriors clash their weapons and call out their battle cries. The Moonstone blazes with a vivid white light that illuminates the whole hall and the faces of the fierce Masbaté. Samu draws his own sword with a great cry. ‘The final battle begins,’ he bellows. ‘Revenge will be ours. Death to the Shadakine! Death to the Shadakine Wytches…and death to the Wytch-king, Shasarak, foe of the Masbaté and the Shianti, enemy of all life itself!’</p>
<p>The great chamber echoes with the ferocious cries of the Masbaté warriors. When the clamour has died down, you and Tanith are led to chambers within the mountainside, there to eat and rest. The following morning you will meet King Samu to discuss ways in which the Masbaté can aid you in your struggle against Shasarak. You drift off to sleep that night with your spirits lifted. Tomorrow you must ensure the safety of the Army of the Freedom Guild before the Shadakine force, due to move in two days, is able to march against it. You know now that you will not have to face that peril alone.</p>

Parts of many beasts exist in grotesque combinations, a perverse mockery of nature’s laws. Hundreds of corrupted faces look up at you sat astride the great white stallion upon the highest ridge in the valley. Even the stolid temperament of the Simar steed is shaken. It stamps and snorts, obviously distressed. A sinister moan of disquiet ripples through the creatures’ cursed ranks. You sway in the saddle, recoiling from the malice focused on you.

<p>In the dim light of night, you see a sparkle in the distance. It is a river. Both you and Tanith break into a run, only stopping, breathlessly, to drink its cool waters. You have drunk long and deep before your thirst is quenched. Tanith expels a breath of satisfaction, sitting up on her haunches and wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. She scours the land.</p>
<p>‘I’d guess that this is the Dolani River,’ she says. ‘It leads south, where it fills Lake Dolani about thirty miles downstream. Upstream, its source is somewhere in the Kashima Mountains.’</p>

<p>You continue the journey. At noon you cross the River Anduis near the town of Sena. You stop to warn the townspeople of Sena of the advance of Shadakine forces and enlist their help in destroying the bridge. This will ensure that the garrison at Andui, and the larger army beyond the River Dosar, will have to cross the River Anduis at the bridge of the city of Andui.</p>
<p>By late afternoon you can see the large and mysterious Forest of Fernmost looming in the west. You have made good time. The Masbaté are tireless runners and have kept pace with your horse with little effort. You are passing a group of hills beyond the boundaries of the dark forest when you see a group of horsemen riding towards you. Each of them wears a red veil, part of the uniform of the Army of the Freedom Guild. When the riders are within a hundred paces, they stop and aim their bows at you.</p>
<p>‘Hail there men of the Freedom Guild. We are friends. Put down your weapons,’ you shout.</p>
<p>‘Who calls himself friend, yet marches from the north before an army?’ questions one of the riders.</p>
<p>‘I would speak with your leader, Sado of the Long Knife,’ you reply. ‘Tell him an old friend has returned to aid him. Tell him it is I, Grey Star, of the Shianti.’</p>
<p>At these words, the horsemen lower their bows and look at you in amazement as you ride towards them. You now wear your grey Shianti robe once more. Their expressions become joyous. ‘You have come. You have returned,’ they cry. ‘Sado said it would be so but none believed.’</p>
<p>With glad hearts, the horsemen lead you and the Masbaté to the Freedom Guild’s camp, which lies a few miles south of the hills. You come upon a sprawling mass of tents and fluttering banners. The camp is alive with activity. As you and the Masbaté pick your way among the tents and the campfires you attract a great deal of attention. Some soldiers offer a rousing cheer at the sight of the size of the Masbaté host: useful reinforcements in a time of desperate need. You and Samu leave the Masbaté to pitch their own camp in an unploughed field nearby and go to Sado’s tent together. The tent flap is pulled aside and Sado of the Long Knife steps out. You recognize his lean, haggard face and dangerous blue eyes. These eyes soften and a smile breaks across his face when he sees you.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star, I knew you would come back,’ he says. ‘Hail Samu, and welcome.’ You both exchange greetings with the brave leader of the Freedom Guild. Inside his tent you tell him of the success of your quest for the Moonstone and the warning words of the Shianti, when they spoke to you in the chamber of the Moonstone.</p>
<p>‘And so,’ you say to close your story, ‘it is their wish that we fall back into the Forest of Fernmost to escape the larger Shadakine Army that is sure to come against us once they have crossed the Dosar and Anduis rivers.’</p>
<p>Sado’s brow furrows. ‘But the forest is a place of evil,’ he says. ‘Perhaps foul creatures of Shasarak’s lurk there—creatures that would be his slaves if he desired it. Surely it would be better to march on Suhn and take it by siege. Once we occupied it, we would have a stranglehold on the bulk of Shadakine trade. It is the only port foreigners will visit in the Shadakine Empire, and its city walls would offer a better defence.’</p>
<p>‘The Shadakine host would reach you before the Port of Suhn could be reduced,’ you tell him patiently. ‘And they outnumber your army three to one. You would be cut off from your base at Karnali and the Shadakine would be able to send reinforcements by sea. You would lose Karnali for sure and the whole seat of the rebellion would be destroyed, and your army too.’</p>
<p>Sado looks doubtful. ‘My army numbers ten thousand men. All are well trained. Your long absence has not seen us idle. We have engaged Shasarak’s slaves wherever we have found them and my soldiers are well tested in combat.’</p>
<p>The argument lasts well into the night, but Sado’s faith in you, the Moonstone that you bear, and the wisdom of the Shianti, of whom you have spoken, eventually persuade him. Preparations are made to move the army out the following morning.</p>

A long pause ensues after completion of the chant: Earth spirits are notorious for their slow wits. Then there is a faint tremor in the ground beneath your feet. With an explosion of rocks and soil, a huge figure rears up before you. Its body is shaped like that of a muscular human, but it is angular, sharp, and hard like rock. It is a Stoneghast. A thing of granite rather than flesh, it clambers out of the chasm it has made to reach you and stands above you, a towering fifteen feet in height. Taking great pains to make your command as simple as possible, you point at the stone door of the ziggurat. ‘Smash!’ you shout clearly.</p>

<p>As you approach the building, its huge size becomes apparent. It is a magnificent structure, a towering ziggurat. As you stand before it, you realize that it is very old. The stone is weathered and overgrown with weeds and the cornerstones have been worn to ragged curves by the wind. It looks deserted—an ideal place to shelter for the night if only you could find some water. Tanith walks up and examines a section of the wall. It is inscribed with symbols.</p>
<p>‘This was once a building belonging to the Masbaté tribe,’ she says. ‘They built it long ago.’</p>
<p>You listen with interest. The Masbaté were the original inhabitants of the Lissan Plain. The present-day king of the Masbaté, Samu, a noble and fearless warrior, accompanied you when you sought the Moonstone. But he was a king without a kingdom, for Shasarak slew all the Masbaté, unleashing the peril of a demon plague to roam the Lissan Plain. It is said that those demons roam the plain still. You find the existence of the building curious, for the Masbaté were a nomadic tribe, crossing the plain according to the seasons and the needs of their cattle. Why should they build anything so permanent?</p>

<p>The following morning you talk with Samu in his private chamber. You enquire after the fates of the old Kundi man, Urik the Wise, and Hugi the Thief, who also accompanied you on your quest for the Shadow Gate. You learn that Urik returned south to rejoin his people in the forests of the Azanam. Hugi, much to your surprise, returned to fight alongside Sado of the Long Knife with the Army of the Freedom Guild. Samu journeyed north from Desolation Valley to revisit his old country, the Lissan Plain. By chance he stumbled upon the surviving members of his people, who lived within the small belt of land around Lake Dolani and Lake Iss. It seems that the demons of the Lissan Plain are reluctant to cross water and so the lands beyond the rivers of the plain remained unstained by their presence. Only one pass leads out of the plain to the country that surrounds it beyond the mountains and the Masbaté held this pass against the demons. Under Samu’s newfound kingship, the last survivors of the Masbaté were reunited and formed a new, though smaller, realm around the southern lakes of Lissan. They created for themselves a home within the mountains, using it as a place to hide from the malevolent eye of Shasarak. They have fought unceasingly with the demons of the Lissan Plain, which Shasarak left to roam at will after the last of the Masbaté were thought to be slain, for the Masbaté still hope to regain the whole of the plain.</p>
<p>‘Their numbers are much reduced, compared to the great host that defeated us of old, though many hundreds still remain, especially the more powerful and cunning of their kind,’ explains Samu. ‘And there is a power that eludes us yet, the power that allows them to remain in the world. There is a magical gate within the hills near Lake Tilos, the gate that allowed them into the world. It was Shasarak who opened this portal for them and they are able to travel through it to their demon plane as they wish. Whenever they are attacked by a Masbaté force likely to defeat them, they can transport themselves to this portal instantly. While such an escape route remains open to them, we can never hope to defeat them entirely.’</p>
<p>While Samu speaks, a plan begins to form in your mind, a plan that would rid the Masbaté of the demon plague forever and provide an answer to the problem of delaying the Shadakine Army long enough for you to warn the Freedom Guild of the overwhelming force that marches against them. You remember how the Moonstone opened a corridor from the Daziarn plane to the real world. Surely it must be able to reverse the process and close the portal in the hills east of Lake Tilos.</p>
<p>‘If it were not for the demon plague,’ Samu continues, ‘and the threat it offers, we of the Masbaté would have joined forces with the Freedom Guild long ago but our wives and children must be protected. We could not leave them to the mercies of the demon plague. It is our belief that when the demons cross water they lose their ability to transport themselves to their portal. But if we warriors were not here to withstand them, they would have no need to use that power.’</p>
<p>‘Worry no longer King Samu,’ you say, as a plan crystallizes in your mind. ‘I will close the demon portal and, with the help of your brave warriors, I will lure the evil demon host to the Shadakine themselves.’ You explain the plan. You will journey to the Hills of Tilos and, using the Moonstone, attempt to close the portal. Such an action is sure to attract every demon of Lissan against you. Then you will flee to the pass in the Kashima Mountains with the demon horde in pursuit. You will time this action so that you are able to lead the demons into the rear of the Shadakine column as it approaches the bridge that crosses the River Dosar at Lanzi.</p>
<p>‘But how can you be sure that the Shadakine Army will not have crossed the bridge at Lanzi before you reach them?’ Samu asks.</p>
<p>‘The Masbaté must hold the bridge against the Shadakine until I can lure the demons against them,’ you reply.</p>
<p>Samu nods in understanding. ‘And who will go with you to the portal?’</p>
<p>‘I will go alone. All of the Masbaté will be needed to hold the bridge. My Magical Powers and the Moonstone will protect me. They must.’</p>
<p>Suddenly the door of the king’s chamber is thrown open. Tanith stands there, white-faced and trembling. ‘She has found me, Grey Star,’ she says in a quavering voice. ‘She has searched and she has found me!’ Tanith looks weak; she can barely stand. Her eyes have a terrible haunted look.</p>
<p>‘Who…who has found you?’ you ask, fearing the answer.</p>
<p>‘Mother Magri, my old mistress, the Shadakine Wytch of Suhn. She has searched for me with the Kazim Stone and she has found me. Long I resisted her as she tried to probe my mind. She beckons, Grey Star, she calls, I cannot resist her much longer.’</p>
<p>While Tanith remains, she is of great danger to you, for in seeking Tanith Mother Magri will discover that you have returned to the world. As a servant of the Wytch-king, Shasarak, Mother Magri and her power over Tanith imperils your life and your entire quest. Tanith, it seems, has realized this already.</p>

A tense, uneasy silence descends on the men: they are anxious to fight. That night you are awakened by the crooning call of voices that beckon you.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, you rise and follow the sound deep into the forest. As you walk among the impenetrable shadows, you hear, mingled with the calls, the mournful creak of trees, whose branches have been stirred by a newly-risen wind. You become aware of a sickly yellow glow deeper in the wood. You walk towards it, treading a path that leads up a steep hill of craggy, moss-covered stone. At the top of the hill are seven hulking shapes, tall as trees, wreathed in yellow light. The light reminds you of the yellow light of the Kazim Stones, instruments of truth and torture, power and possession, belonging to the Shadakine Wytches. A wave of panic grows inside you. The crooning is emanating from the tall forms within the halos of light, only now the words of the song are distinct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
         We are the Kazim, masters of truth,<br />
         Wielders of power, steadfast in sooth,<br />
         Lost are our stone hearts to the evil of the night,<br />
         Clutched by the dark one, stealer of light,<br />
         We wait for the Grey One, foe of the dark,<br />
         Heralding battle, to regain our hearts.<br />

<p>‘Will no one follow?’ you implore with searching eyes. There is a long, brooding silence, broken only by the occasional ring of armour as the Guildsmen shuffle uneasily.</p>
<p>‘Will none listen to the wisdom of the Shianti?’ you shout into the silence. There is the sound of movement to your left. With relief you see King Samu striding towards you, leading a long line of his own warriors.</p>
<p>‘We of the Masbaté will heed the words of the Shianti,’ he booms. ‘We at least do not fear to tread beneath the trees of Fernmost, not while a wizard of the Shianti leads us.’</p>
<p>You hope that Samu’s words will shame the Guildsmen into entering the forest. You are well aware of the legends that scare them. The Forest of Fernmost was once part of the ancient nation of Taklakot. Beyond the western edge of Fernmost lie the Mountains of Morn, which overlook the infamous ‘deadlands’. There stands the forbidden city of Gyanima and the blasted wasteland of Desolation Valley, which was the heart of the kingdom. Centuries ago, Shasarak came to the people of Taklakot as a wise Shianti, though he had turned from the path of goodness long before, refusing the exile that the goddess Ishir had demanded of his people. Because of the forbidden secrets that he unlocked for the race of Taklakot, a great calamity befell them. Great fires rushed through the kingdom and destroyed an entire civilization in a day. Only Shasarak survived, though he was horribly crippled and burnt. Many say that the dead spirits of Taklakot roam the Forest of Fernmost to this day, seeking vengeance and taking it upon any who enter the forest.</p>
<p>Samu’s words and example seem to work. Gradually the Guildsmen move forward towards the forest. At last all are following the broad trail west, deep into the gloom of the forest. You lead the army into the deepening shadow. The forest shelters an eerie feeling of malice. A grey mist lingers upon the ground and the branches and leaves above form a sombre, green canopy that blots out the sky. There is a strange musty smell in the air. The army are ordered into various positions along the forest’s edge to watch for the advance of the Shadakine host you left at the River Dosar. They are completely hidden by the tangled woods and thick undergrowth. Sado tells you he is grateful that you did not ask the army to journey any further into Fernmost, for, as you draw closer to its heart, a strange, watchful presence can be felt.</p>

Though you are glad to see that your presence has heartened so many, you realize with regret that word of your passing is sure to reach the city of Andui to the northeast, where there is sure to be a Shadakine garrison.

<p>You speak your mind to Sado and for once he does not argue. You mount and you and Samu ride either side of the grim-faced leader of the Freedom Guild.

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="638" width="386" src="ill18.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration XVIII</strong>—The Freedom Guild surges forward, the ghostly figure of Kazim leading the way.
<br /><br /></div><p>The battle that follows is long and terrible. The Freedom Guild almost fail, but with Sado’s iron leadership and your brave resolve they endure, although the number of casualties is high. The Kazim reclaims its heart of stone, slaying Mother Chowloon, the Shadakine Wytch who bore it. As she dies, much of the fighting fury and ferocity that filled the Shadakine fades. The Army of the Freedom Guild senses the Shadakine’s loss of morale and press home their advantage. Soon, they have beaten the much larger force into a full-scale retreat. The entire Shadakine Army heads north. Sado leads his army in pursuit, turning the retreat into a rout. It is vital that the Shadakine Army does not reach Shadaki, for there they would find new leadership under Shasarak’s hand. They are still a large army and with Shasarak to lead them they could turn the tables once again.</p>
<p>The Army of the Freedom Guild pursues the fleeing Shadakine Army across much of the Shadakine Empire. The Shadakine find no place to hide, for all the cities of the Empire are in open revolt. Each Kazim has reclaimed its heart and slain the Shadakine Wytch that ruled each city. During the four days of the pursuit you are not required to exert any energy or use any of your Magical Powers and you regain 8 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and 9 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. Constantly harrying the ever-dwindling Shadakine force, the Army of the Freedom Guild crosses the great Kalamar River and approaches the Mountains of Lara.</p>
<p>The Mountains of Lara contain the infamous Morn Pass. It was through this pass that the Shadakine first invaded the provinces of the south. It is the last barrier between you and the fortress city of Shadaki. With growing dread you realize that the time of your final battle with Shasarak is fast approaching. With his armies scattered or destroyed, it only remains for you to challenge him yourself and ensure that the land remains free. Your trepidation is coupled with suspicion. Shasarak has many powers at his disposal. Why then has he not used them to challenge Sado’s tiny army, much reduced in numbers? Perhaps there is some other reason why he does not bring his full might to bear?</p>

<p>You mount and ride with all speed to the site of the battle at the northern edge of the camp. You arrive to see Sado with a hundred cavalry upon a low rise overlooking the battle. As many as a thousand Shadakine foot soldiers are charging towards you.</p>
<p>‘Good morning to you, Grey Star,’ Sado calls. ‘The morning begins with battle. Have a care to stay by me, for you know not the strategy I have in mind and you must be sure to move when I do.’</p>
<p>You glance behind the line of Sado’s cavalrymen and see a line of soldiers armed with crossbows, busily loading their weapons. The warriors are kneeling to conceal their presence. When the Shadakine have drawn but two hundred paces away, Sado barks a command. At his word, the line of horsemen parts to allow those bearing crossbows to step forward. Sado shouts again and the crossbowmen release a deadly hail of arrows that flies towards the Shadakine host. Many fall dead in the face of this lethal volley. But incredibly the survivors continue.</p>
<p>‘These Shadakine are strong of heart. Brave but foolish,’ Sado murmurs.</p>
<p>The crossbowmen reload and release another shower of arrows. As the bolts find their targets, many more Shadakine fall dead. More than half their number have now fallen. You look back to the camp: it is still a chaotic mass of rushing men, trying to order themselves and leave. Samu and his Masbaté have already left in good order but they have the advantage of smaller numbers and a strong leader to command them.</p>
<p>The Shadakine continue to advance, their faces set with grim determination. There is no time for the crossbowmen to reload their weapons before the remainder of the Shadakine, almost five hundred men, fall upon the Guild’s ranks. At Sado’s command, the cavalry charges down the rise at the Shadakine. A furious mêlée ensues but the Shadakine maintain the upper hand and the cavalry are forced to retreat in disorder. It will not be long before the Shadakine are fighting against the bulk of the army of the Freedom Guild, who are still attempting to flee into the forest. Looking to the distant hills, you see the reason for this early raid by the Shadakine. A line of Shadakine chariots has appeared. From earlier encounters with the Shadakine, you know that sharpened blades adorn the wheels of the chariots. You shudder to think of the harm they could inflict on the disordered lines of the retiring Freedom Guild.</p>

You are looking upon a huge, grim city that overlooks the sea. Its looming walls are built of black stone and granite from the mountains of Jazer. The image shifts and you feel as if you are being drawn into the city with its tall, crenellated walls and towers. You guess that this is the fortress city of Shadaki, Shasarak’s home, and the heart of the Shadakine Empire. The scene shifts to a high tower, and suddenly you are looking down into a wide, round hall, full of darkness and foreboding. At one end of the hall is a throne, rudely carved from stone; at the other end is a wall of fire. Kneeling before the wall of fire is the crippled figure of Shasarak, who looks as if he is pleading with someone. A pair of eyes stares out from the wall of fire. Suddenly the picture fades.</p>

Ignorant of the torment you suffer, Sado looks over to you, a broad smile splitting his face. His eyes shine with the joy of his victory over the Shadakine. If only he knew what it is you must yet face. You hope his confidence in you is not misplaced.</p>
<p>A faint tremor shakes the ground. Horses rear and whinny their distress as the land cracks and splits. All eyes look in horror at the shapes now heaving out of the ground, twisting blindly with skeletal claws outstretched. Humans, horses, all manner of beasts, crawl out into the light from their graves beneath the pass. Shasarak, the master Necromancer, has summoned the legions of the dead that lie beneath this old battlefield. Hundreds of gnarled shapes rise up, blocking each end of the pass. The army is trapped and you with it. A skeleton shape stands before you, its frozen smile leering savagely. It has a rusty sword in its hand and leans forward to strike.</p>

In a terrible war, hordes of Shadakine warriors pursued the Masbaté across the plains in their great war chariots, led by the Wytch-king himself. The Masbaté were able to resist the Shadakine, despite overwhelming odds, until Shasarak summoned the demon plague.

<p>Your call for aid is answered by the element of fire in the only way it is able. Sheets of flame spring up all around you, catching the dry brush and foliage of the forest in seconds. The bright light of the fires provides an excellent target for the Shadakine crossbowmen. A hail of arrows arcs towards you.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>

<p>Shasarak’s torment is written in deep lines upon his ruined face. The wall of fire is a portal to Agarash’s realm. Shasarak’s bargain is to change places with Agarash, setting the demon free and enduring Agarash’s banishment for all time. He chooses eternal torment before eternal death.</p>
<p>As Shasarak disappears through the wall, Agarash calls out with glee, ‘Free, free at last!’ The eyes disappear and a vast, flaming shoulder moves out from the wall. You glimpse a wing and a clawed foot.</p>

<p>A feeling of panic surges through the men. Sado looks aghast. The army will be forced out of the forest and into the jaws of the Shadakine to be slaughtered, for the Freedom Guild lacks sufficient numbers to face the Shadakine in an all-out assault. Just as you think you are facing certain doom, a vast shape immersed in a pallid, yellow glow strides out from amongst the burning trees. It is a Kazim. Many of Sado’s men shout out in alarm and horror, thinking that they are being attacked from the rear but you know this is not the case.</p>
<p>‘Do not worry,’ you assure Sado. ‘This is a Kazim. It fights with us.’</p>
<p>The stony creature, measuring twelve feet high at least, moves through the parting ranks of Guildsmen and stops at the edge of the forest. It is alone; the other Kazim must already be on their way to the other Shadakine Wytches in the pursuit of their hearts. The Kazim at the edge of the forest turns its head this way and that, searching. When it has located that which it seeks, it moves forward at great speed.</p>

<p>Your horse quickly covers the miles of your long, desperate ride. The demon host has not caught you, although it is not far away. Looking to the east you see great clouds of dust hanging in the air. These are the tell-tale signs of an army on the move. It must be the rear of the Shadakine column approaching the bridge at Lanzi. You double your speed. Now you can hear the cries of battle and the ringing of steel. You gallop around the edge of the town of Lanzi on its western side and emerge close to the River Dosar. Reining in the horse for a moment, you stop and look along the line of the river. A mile away you can see the bridge. The Masbaté still hold it but they fight a desperate battle against a huge force of Shadakine warriors.</p>

<br /><br /></div><p>With a wild yell, you head towards the battle, the demon pack baying at your heels. You reach the Shadakine force that fights at the bridge and, rushing up to an officer, you indicate the demon horde behind you. He curses and orders some of his men to turn and face this new threat. He orders you to the rear of the army group. ‘Alert Warward Gatakhan,’ he shouts after you. ‘He must bring forward more men.’</p>
<p>You nod your head, although, of course, you have no intention of obeying the order. Your sole objective is to cross the river and tell the Masbaté that they may join the Army of the Freedom Guild in the south.</p>

<p>In a stunning display of battle skills, you hack a path of blazing, magical fire through the Shadakine ranks. On the bridge you can hear the cheering of the Masbaté as you wreak terrible havoc among your foes. They urge you on, their cries growing louder as you draw nearer. Suddenly your horse is cut from under you and you throw yourself clear and onto the stone bridge to run the last steps towards the Masbaté. They rush forward to protect your flanks. You are safe. Samu rushes to meet you. ‘Grey Star, that was magnificent…’ he begins.</p>
<p>‘No time…no time,’ you pant. ‘Sound the retreat. We must flee. See? I have brought the demon plague.’</p>
<p>It is as you say. Even now, across the river, you can see a wild, screaming mass as the demon horde battles with the Shadakine. Samu nods and springs into action. He sounds a battle horn and the Masbaté retire. The Shadakine cannot pursue while the demon host fights at their back. However, you must destroy the bridge to prevent pursuit should the Shadakine, whose entire army numbers in thousands defeat the demon plague too soon.</p>

<p>Dawn is breaking when the alarm is raised and you are alerted to an attack on the camp. Swiftly you rise, taking up your Staff and rushing outside. There is great clamour everywhere. Men are rushing in all directions, still donning their armour. You rush towards Sado’s tent. He is not there but an attendant tells you that a group of Shadakine has attempted an attack. Sado is already at the scene of the battle with a unit of soldiers, hand picked to fight a rearguard action, while the remainder of the army retreats to the Forest of Fernmost. This unit was chosen by Sado himself last night in readiness for just such an eventuality. You are sure that the Shadakine attack cannot be from the large army you trapped on the other side of the River Dosar; it can only be the garrison from Andui.</p>

<p>You hurl the fury of your last desperate attack at the portal, attempting to close it.</p>
<p>‘NO!’ the demon thunders. ‘Do not…’</p>
<p>You battle on as the demon struggles to escape with all its power. You must close the portal and tear down the wall. Flame rages around the hall, striving against the purity of the Moonstone’s light. A yawning blackness threatens to engulf you as a hurricane of might swirls out from the Moonstone and assaults the portal, a doorway to damnation. You fall to your knees and look up into the raging wall of incandescence before slipping into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>You wake to see the face of Tanith looking into yours. You sit up with a jolt. You are lying in a bed in a tall tower. ‘The portal…Agarash…is he…?’ you stammer.</p>
<p>Tanith smiles. ‘All vanquished,’ she replies. ‘The Demonlord Agarash and his portal of fire have gone and Shasarak with them. You have triumphed, Grey Star. We are saved.’</p>
<p>With a wild laugh you leap from the bed and hug Tanith with joy. You have saved your people. ‘Come,’ she says, leading you to a doorway. It opens on to a balcony that overlooks a large square in the centre of the city of Shadaki. There you look upon a huge crowd. They let out a thunderous cheer as they see you.</p>
<p>Later you retire to the chamber. Standing there are Sado of the Long Knife and Samu, the Masbaté King. You clasp their outstretched hands, eyes brimming with tears of happiness. You grin furiously, glad to see that they are alive. A wave of exultant relief runs through you as you receive their grateful thanks and congratulations. They tell you that the Shadakine have fled back to the Sadi Desert. All the cities of the land are free capitals as before. The long task of rebuilding has already begun and all sing your praise to the furthest corners of what was once the Shadakine Empire. They have proclaimed you their ruler, the Wizard Regent of the Free Peoples, for their faith and trust in your wisdom and courage is unshakable.</p>

<h2><a name="passing">The Passing of the Shianti</a></h2>


<p>And so it was that the shame of the Shianti was absolved. With the defeat of the Wytch-king, Shasarak, the renegade Shianti Master, the Shadakine Empire he had built fell. The Shadakine people fled back to their former home in the Sadi Desert, and Grey Star—the champion of the Shianti cause—was proclaimed ‘Wizard Regent’ of the free peoples of the old empire, to oversee a time of rebirth and liberty. The only Shadakine who did not return to the Sadi Desert was the Lady Tanith. She and Grey Star were soon married, as many foretold they would be, to form the founding line of a Magiocracy destined to rule the new confederation of free states formed from the ashes of the old empire. For the Shianti themselves a higher destiny dawned. The Goddess Ishir came to them on the Isle of Lorn and took them up to the Plane of Light. Their reward was to dwell as immortals by her side and in her service in peace and serenity.</p>
<p>The Wizard Grey Star saw them once before they departed and many fond and sad farewells were exchanged. To Grey Star was bequeathed the nature of true Shianti wisdom, the last of their ancient magical secrets which only a lifetime’s study would unlock from the hundreds of dusty volumes, scrolls, and magical artefacts. The Moonstone was given into the care of the Shianti and taken with them into the Plane of Light, for still its power was too great to remain on Magnamund.</p>
<p>Grey Star then returned to his people. Sado of the Long Knife was made general of the army, King Samu had his lands in the Lissan Plain restored to him, and Urik the Wise of the Kundi peoples was summoned to act as advisor to the Wizard Regent and Lady Tanith the Wytch-queen. Despite his newfound responsibilities and duties, Grey Star looked forward to a time of hope and happiness. In this far corner of Magnamund, at least for now, peace reigned.</p>
<p>And so ends the chronicle of the first quest of the Wizard <strong>Grey Star</strong>.<sup><a href="#passing-1-foot" name="passing-1">23</a></sup></p>

<h2><a name="footnotz">Footnotes</a></h2>


<div class="footnote"><p>[<a name="gamerulz-1-foot" href="#gamerulz-1">1</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) It is implied that you must pick a new <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> even if have already completed previous one or more <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures. This conflicts with the rules for the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books where you carry over your score from a previous successfully completed adventure. For the sake of consistency, players may wish to carry over their existing score from the last <cite>Grey Star</cite> book they completed.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-2-foot" href="#gamerulz-2">2</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) The original intent of the author was most likely that the player should add 50 to their final <small>WILLPOWER</small> score from the end of their last successfully completed <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-5-foot" href="#gamerulz-5">3</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This may leave you with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="#sect175">Section 175</a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, then you use <small>ENDURANCE</small> points at a rate of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points for every 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point you lack (i.e. 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points = 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point). If your <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <small>WILLPOWER</small> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score.</p>
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-3-foot" href="#gamerulz-3">4</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <small>WILLPOWER</small> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <small>WILLPOWER</small>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-4-foot" href="#gamerulz-4">5</a>]  (<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) The original intent of the author was most likely that the player should add 30 to their final <small>ENDURANCE</small> score from the end of their last successfully completed <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure. In the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, it is standard practice to restore one’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to their original total when carrying them over from one adventure to the next, but the power of the Moonstone seems to change those rules in this case.</p><p>[<a name="powers-1-foot" href="#powers-1">6</a>]  (<a href="#powers">Magical Powers</a>) The wording of this section of the rules seems to indicate—if read literally—that you may choose your set of Lesser Magicks again if you have completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books. In order to preserve consistency with other books, you should not choose your Lesser Magicks again. If you have currently mastered five Lesser Magicks, you may choose one additional Lesser Magick from the list. If you have already mastered six Lesser Magicks, you keep these. If you choose Alchemy as a new Lesser Magick, or you have not mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy but you have selected the Higher Magick of Theurgy, you also receive a Herb Pouch with contents, as detailed in the Equipment section.</p><p>[<a name="powers-2-foot" href="#powers-2">7</a>]  (<a href="#powers">Magical Powers</a>) If your <small>WILLPOWER</small> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p><p>[<a name="equipmnt-1-foot" href="#equipmnt-1">8</a>]  (<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a>) If you have completed a previous adventure, you keep all equipment you had at the end of that adventure. You do not receive any new equipment, unless you have just selected Alchemy as your sixth Lesser Magick, or if you have not mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy but you have selected the Higher Magick of Theurgy, in which case you receive a Herb Pouch with contents as indicated in this section.</p><p>[<a name="equipmnt-2-foot" href="#equipmnt-2">9</a>]  (<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a>) If you have mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy or the Higher Magick of Theurgy and therefore have a Herb Pouch, you may choose to keep potions, vials, or ingredients in either the Herb Pouch or your Backpack. All other Backpack Items must be kept in your Backpack.</p><p>[<a name="equipmnt-3-foot" href="#equipmnt-3">10</a>]  (<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a>) The Collector’s Editions of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books clarify that ‘You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.’</p><p>[<a name="sect25-1-foot" href="#sect25-1">11</a>]  (<a href="#sect25">Section 25</a>) If you wish to take the Sheath, record it as a Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p><p>[<a name="sect25-2-foot" href="#sect25-2">12</a>]  (<a href="#sect25">Section 25</a>) If you wish to take the Sheath, record it as a Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p><p>[<a name="sect47-1-foot" href="#sect47-1">13</a>]  (<a href="#sect47">Section 47</a>) Although the term ‘Agarashi’ is not used anywhere else in the <cite>Grey Star</cite> books, it is used in other books as the collective term for the monstrous servants of Agarash the Damned.</p><p>[<a name="sect104-1-foot" href="#sect104-1">14</a>]  (<a href="#sect104">Section 104</a>) If you do not have sufficient <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, you may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points. This may leave you with a negative <small>WILLPOWER</small> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative. Alternatively, you may choose the method used in <a href="#sect175">Section 175</a> for resolving this problem: For the <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you lack, you use <small>ENDURANCE</small> points at a rate of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points for every 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point (i.e. 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points = 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point).</p><p>[<a name="sect112-1-foot" href="#sect112-1">15</a>]  (<a href="#sect112">Section 112</a>) If you do not have sufficient <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, you may choose the method used in <a href="#sect175">Section 175</a> for resolving this problem: For the <small>WILLPOWER</small> points you lack, you must use <small>ENDURANCE</small> points at a rate of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points for every 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point (i.e. 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points = 1 <small>WILLPOWER</small> point).</p><p>[<a name="sect139-1-foot" href="#sect139-1">16</a>]  (<a href="#sect139">Section 139</a>) If you do not have sufficient <small>WILLPOWER</small> points, you may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <small>WILLPOWER</small> points.

If you are versed in the Higher Magick of Thaumaturgy you can teleport by deducting 2 <small>WILLPOWER</small> points from your total.

Tarama Seeds cannot be used to maintain the effect of a spell or in place of other drains on your <small>WILLPOWER</small>, like mental attacks. It also seems inappropriate to use a Tarama Seed in close combat where you could then decide to expend an infinite amount of <small>WILLPOWER</small> to automatically win a fight.</p><p>[<a name="sect336-1-foot" href="#sect336-1">21</a>]  (<a href="#sect336">Section 336</a>) Tarama Seeds may be recorded as Special Items since they don’t take up space in your Herb Pouch or Backpack.

<h4><a name="lic-2-1">2.1</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document. Indeed, you have no right to receive or view a copy or copies without first accepting this License as legally valid and binding and agreeing to the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>

<h4><a name="lic-2-4">2.3</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators retain all other rights to their respective portions of the Internet Editions not covered by this License.

That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

<h3><a name="lic-4">4. Jurisdiction</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-4-0">4.0</a></h4>

<p>If, in consequence of court judgement or the laws of a particular area, any portion of the License is held as invalid or unenforceable in any particular circumstance, you are no longer granted any rights under the terms of this License in that circumstance. You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-5">5. Revision of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-5-0">5.0</a></h4>

<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
