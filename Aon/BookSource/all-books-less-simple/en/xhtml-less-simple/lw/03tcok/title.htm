 <div class="frontmatter">

  <p>You are Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords. Shocking news has just reached your homeland that Vonotar the Traitor still lives and now rules over the Ice Barbarians of Kalte.</p>

  <p>The King has vowed to your people that Vonotar will be brought to justice for his crimes. But it is a promise that only you can fulfil.</p>

  <p>In <strong><cite>The Caverns of Kalte</cite></strong>, you must brave the terrible dangers of the ice kingdom in your quest to capture your most hated foe. But be warned! It is a challenge that will test your skill and endurance to the very limit.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


     <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>In the northern land of Sommerlund, it had been the custom for many centuries to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery of Kai. There they were taught the skills and disciplines of their noble fathers.</p>
<p>You are Lone Wolf, and you are now the last of the Warrior Lords of Sommerlund. One year ago, the ancient enemy of your people—the Darklords of Helgedad—suddenly invaded Sommerlund and completely devastated the Kai Monastery. All of the Kai warriors were in attendance for the feast of Fehmarn, and all except you were massacred.</p>
<p>You fought your way to Holmgard, the capital of your country, where the King sent you upon a desperate quest for help. Your mission was fraught with great danger, for Sommerlund had been betrayed by one of its own magicians—Vonotar the Traitor. His agents sought to kill you at every opportunity, but your skill and strength defeated their evil aims. You returned to Holmgard at the head of a great fleet—the allies of Durenor—and destroyed the Darklord army that besieged your capital.</p>
<p>Much of Sommerlund was ruined by the war. The rich farmlands were laid waste and many towns were razed to the ground. But the Sommlending are a tough people and were undaunted by the enormous task that lay ahead. They set about the rebuilding of war-torn Sommerlund with such determination that now, one year later, few of the scars of war remain visible.</p>
<p>For the crucial part that you played in the victory, the King has bestowed upon you the rank and title of ‘Fryearl of Sommerlund’, a rare honour for one so young. The ruins of the Kai Monastery and much of the surrounding lands are now ‘Fryelund’ under your protection.</p>
<p>Work to rebuild the monastery was about to commence when disturbing news from the north prompted the King to summon you to the capital. Many merchants, returning from the summer trading expeditions to Kalte, told of the fall of the Brumalmarc—the leader of the Ice Barbarians. The description of the hunchbacked magician who has succeeded the fierce Brumalmarc fits only one man—Vonotar the Traitor.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the Darklords, Vonotar escaped to the frozen wastes of Kalte. He made his way to the ice fortress of Ikaya where, through deception, he tricked the cruel Brumalmarc into adopting him as his magician. It was a mistake that was to cost the barbarian leader his fortress and his life.</p>
<p>The news that Vonotar still lives spreads like wildfire throughout Sommerlund. Thousands of Sommlending surround the capital and demand that Vonotar be made to pay for his treachery. So great is the outcry that the King is obliged to promise that the evil traitor will be brought back to Holmgard, and made to stand trial for his crimes.</p>
<p>For you, Lone Wolf, the King’s promise is the start of a quest that will pit you against a hated foe, deep within the hostile Caverns of Kalte.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, and Kai Disciplines which you can now carry over with you to Book 3. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You may choose one bonus <a href="#discplnz">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure you have successfully completed; then read the <a href="#equipmnt">section on equipment</a> for Book 3 carefully.</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="camflage">Camouflage</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings. In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Camouflage’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hunting">Hunting</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Lord will never starve in the wild. He will always be able to hunt for food for himself except in areas of wasteland and desert. You are aware that most of Kalte is an icy desert and that opportunities for successful hunting will not arise. But this skill is still very useful for it also enables a Kai Lord to move with great speed and dexterity.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Hunting’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sixthsns">Sixth Sense</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Lord of imminent danger. It may also reveal the true purpose of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Sixth Sense’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="tracking">Tracking</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to make the correct choice of a path in the wild, to discover the location of a person or object in a town or city and to read the secrets of footprints or tracks.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Tracking’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="healing">Healing</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline can be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in combat. If you possess this skill you may restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to your total for every numbered section of the book you pass through in which you are not involved in combat. (This is only to be used after your <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) Remember that your <small>ENDURANCE</small> cannot rise above its original level.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill write ‘Healing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wepnskll">Weaponskill</a></h4>

<p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate is taught to master one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines, pick a number in the usual way from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this weapon, you add 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="278" width="386" src="weapons.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean you set out on the adventure carrying that particular weapon. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventures. You cannot carry more than 2 weapons.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponskill in _______ +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points if this weapon carried’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindshld">Mindshield</a></h4>

<p>Vonotar and many of the evil creatures under his command have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Kai Discipline of Mindshield prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindshield: no points lost when attacked by Mindblast’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mndblst">Mindblast</a></h4>

<p>This enables a Kai Lord to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used at the same time as normal combat weapons and adds two extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Not all the creatures encountered on this adventure will be harmed by Mindblast. You will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlknsp">Animal Kinship</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to communicate with some animals and to be able to guess the intentions of others.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Kinship’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindomtr">Mind Over Matter</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Discipline enables a Kai Lord to move small objects with his powers of concentration.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mind Over Matter’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 3 of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite>, you may add a further Kai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="../../lw/04tcod/title.htm#title">Book 4</a>. This additional skill, together with your six or seven other skills and any Special Items that you have picked up in Books <a href="../../lw/01fftd/title.htm#title">1</a>, <a href="../../lw/02fotw/title.htm#title">2</a> and <a href="../../lw/03tcok/title.htm#title">3</a>, may then be used in the next adventure of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series which is called <a href="../../lw/04tcod/title.htm#title"><cite>The Chasm of Doom</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before leaving the northern port of Anskaven, you are escorted to the City Hall and equipped with special winter boots, a tunic, a fur-lined cloak, and mittens. You are given a <a href="#map">Map of Kalte</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess. Remember you can only carry fifty Crowns.)</p>
<p>Before you set sail, you are given the choice of the following items (in addition to those you already possess, but remember you may only carry two weapons). You may take any two of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="sword.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="ssword.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="warhammr.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>
<li>Axe (Weapons)<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="axe.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Items). This restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is only enough for one dose.<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="potion.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>
<li>Quarterstaff (Weapons)<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="79" width="386" src="qstaff.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="food.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>
<li>Broadsword (Weapons)<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="102" width="386" src="bsword.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>
</ul>
<p>List the two items you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You don’t need to make notes but you can refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Short Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Padded Leather Waistcoat—worn on the body.</li>

</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat.

If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be informed of their effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast, to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 17.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Winged Devil’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (17 − 20 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as −3. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
<li>Winged Devil loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>

<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Kai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your mission will be fraught with great danger, for Kalte is a bleak and hostile land and your foe is a master of cunning. Use the <a href="#map">map</a> to help you plot your course to the ice fortress of Ikaya. Make notes as you progress through the story, for they will be of great help in future adventures. Many things that you find will aid you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>There are many routes to the ice fortress of Ikaya, but only one will enable you to capture Vonotar and return to Sommerlund with the minimum of danger. A wise choice of Kai Disciplines and a great deal of courage should enable any player to complete the mission, no matter how weak his initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> or <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures is not essential for the success of this quest.</p>
<p>The betrayal of your country can be avenged by bringing the traitor to justice.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>Even before you accepted the task of bringing Vonotar to justice, preparations were being made for your voyage to Kalte. The captain of the Sommlending warship <cite>Cardonal</cite>, having returned from a long Kaltersee patrol, was ordered to await your arrival at Anskaven. During the night, food, ice equipment, and Kanu-dog teams were taken on board. The mission was highly secret—only senior members of the crew were told the true nature of the voyage that lay ahead.</p>
<p>The plan is to set you ashore at Halle Bluff, drop anchor, and await your return. An élite team of trusted guides will lead you from the bluff to Ikaya. Once inside the ice fortress, you are to hunt down and capture Vonotar, and then return with your guides to the ship. Your mission must be accomplished within thirty days at most, for winter is closing in and no ship can withstand the grip of the Kalte pack-ice. If you do not return in time, the captain will be forced to set sail without you.</p>
<p>For six days, the <cite>Cardonal</cite> sails across the stormy Kaltersee without running into a storm; but every day the temperature steadily drops until a layer of ice covers the decks. On the morning of the seventh day, the snow-capped island of Tola is sighted on the horizon. Soon after, a light wind rises from the east.</p>
<p>At first, there appears to be little danger, but within half an hour a furious blizzard is blowing, and all sight of land quickly vanishes in the scudding drift. All day the furious gale rages. Tremendous winds slice the tops of the huge grey waves and water crashes over the decks, masts, and rigging of the ship, freezing almost immediately into solid ice. The sides of the ship become several feet thick with seawater. It is not until early evening that the weather clears, and although the wind still blows strongly, the force of the gale is spent.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small1.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>You are soon to discover that the gale has blown the ship nearly thirty miles off course, along the lip of the Ljuk ice shelf. You know that to return to Halle Bluff would waste a precious day, so you decide to land on the ice shelf and start your mission from there.</p>
<p>As the last of the Kanu-dogs are carried ashore, your guides tell you of the two possible routes to Ikaya from here. The first route involves a hundred and thirty mile trek to Cloudmaker Mountain and then, following the difficult terrain of the Viad Glacier, a further hundred miles must be covered before you arrive at the ice fortress. The alternative route involves a longer journey of nearly one hundred and eighty miles into the Hrod Basin, followed by a trek of a hundred miles through Storm Giant Pass to Ikaya. Even if the weather and your luck hold good, either route will involve ten days of hard trekking before you reach your goal. You should consult the <a href="#map">map of Kalte</a> before making your decision.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt the shorter, but more difficult Viad Glacier route, <a href="#sect160">turn to 160</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take the longer, but easier Hrod Basin and Storm Giant Pass route, <a href="#sect273">turn to 273</a>.</p>

<p>To your right, you notice that a stone door is cunningly concealed by an intricate wall carving. A close examination of the carving reveals a lever.</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not wish to pull the lever, you may continue climbing the stairs by <a href="#sect76">turning to 76</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect3">3</a></h3>

<p>You watch with a mixture of fascination and revulsion as each segment of the creature shatters and then slowly dissolves into the ice. Soon, all that remains of the Crystal Frostwyrm are the undigested contents of its stomach. To your surprise, in the centre of this mess of fetid flesh and bone, you can see the shank of an Ornate Silver Key.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take this Key, <a href="#sect280">turn to 280</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather ignore it and look for a way to open the fortress door, <a href="#sect344">turn to 344</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>You hide the body under the staircase and quickly search it. You discover a Bone Sword and a Blue Stone Disc. If you wish to keep either or both of these items, mark them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as Special Items<sup><a href="#sect4-1-foot" name="sect4-1">1</a></sup>.

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>You can see two men in ragged clothes, huddled together beside a fire that seems to be burning inside a small metal bowl. Over the flames, the skinned carcass of a small animal is roasting on a spit. The men are old and toothless, and they have a strange glint of madness in their slanted eyes.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="654" width="386" src="ill1.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration I</strong>—Two men in ragged clothes are huddled together beside a small fire.

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>You advance into the darkness, feeling ahead with your weapon for any obstruction. For some distance, the tunnel continues northwards before turning sharply to your right. A few feet ahead, you can now see light streaming from another portal. Beyond this a staircase descends into the dark.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to look through the portal, <a href="#sect224">turn to 224</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>Suddenly, the black slab explodes into hundreds of razor-sharp splinters of stone. Your back is grazed and your ears ring, but otherwise you are unharmed. By taking refuge in the corner of the chamber, you have escaped serious injury. It now seems apparent that the monolith was designed to guard against or ensnare trespassers. A powerful glyph, a spell of protection, must have been placed upon it by an ancient mage.</p>
<p>As the black dust slowly settles, you notice that a panel in the north wall has opened to reveal a darkened exit from the chamber.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try this exit, <a href="#sect145">turn to 145</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to open the door by which you entered, <a href="#sect242">turn to 242</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>The smell is revolting, and you try desperately to hold your breath as you smear handfuls of the slimy grease inside your jacket. As the oil penetrates your skin, you feel a warm glow as if you were near a fire: the more grease you apply, the warmer you become. You also notice that the awful smell is gradually fading. (Note the fact that you have applied Baknar oil on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> although it does not take up any space and only applies for the duration of this adventure.)</p>
<p>‘When it soaks into your skin, you lose your sense of smell,’ says Fenor.</p>
<p>‘Just as well,’ replies Dyce. ‘I don’t think I could stand living with myself otherwise!’</p>
<p>Baknar oil gives excellent insulation from the bitter cold of Kalte, and it may save you valuable <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the near future.</p>
<p>Irian regains consciousness and is soon scooping out the Baknar carcass for himself. Light is now fading fast and you decide to pitch camp in this narrow pass. You prepare a meal, and then you each take it in turns to sit watch, just in case the Baknar decide to return.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect325">Turn to 325</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect9">9</a></h3>

<p>You desperately fight against the agonizing pain, but it is so intense that you soon lose consciousness, and within a few minutes your will has been completely drained—you have become a helpless slave, unable to resist Vonotar’s psychic commands. He orders you to pick up the Ice Barbarian’s sword and draw it across your throat. Powerless to resist, you kill yourself with one quick flick of your wrist.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your mission and your life come to a tragic end.</p>

<p>The pack contains four ornate glass vials. They hold red, orange, green, and black liquids.</p>

<p>The equipment is quickly unpacked and distributed among you. Your share is enough food for 3 Meals, Sleeping Furs, and a Rope. Remember to mark these on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, and note that Sleeping Furs take up the same amount of room as two normal items in your Backpack.</p>
<p>You cannot take the Kanu-dogs with you across the mountains, and you are forced to abandon them here with the sledges. A rope is secured to each person and you set off towards a narrow pass between the dark and sullen peaks. At first, the climb is quite easy; but soon the smooth ice becomes steep and difficult to cross. A wind rises that piles drifts of loose snow against the broken ice, and visibility is quickly reduced to a few yards. The drifts are deceptive and often deep. On two occasions, you sink up to your chest and have to be dug out by the others.</p>
<p>That night, the tent is erected on a table of ice-covered granite overhanging a deep ravine. You are exhausted and almost fall asleep over your evening Meal. (Remember to deduct this Meal from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>‘Do you understand any of the Ice Barbarian language?’ asks Dyce, trying to stimulate conversation. ‘Myjavik is one of the few Ice Barbarian words I know.’</p>
<p>When you ask him what it means, he pauses before answering you. ‘Terror…“Myjavik” means terror.’</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a tremendous noise outside the tent. It sounds like the roar of a large animal.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to draw your weapon and investigate the noise, <a href="#sect180">turn to 180</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lever in the wall and a spy-hole in the centre of the door. Peering through the spy-hole, you see a strange sight. A man in a dark robe is kneeling in the centre of a pentacle chalked on the floor of the chamber. His head is bowed and he seems to be in a trance.</p>

<p>You only just manage to slip through the gap as the stone door slams shut. Unfortunately, if you are wearing a Backpack, two separate items have been crushed and must be discarded here. You may choose which Backpack Items to delete. If you only have one item in your Backpack, then this single item has been destroyed.

<p>As your weapon sinks into the swirling wind, an agonizing blast of intense cold runs through the full length of your arm. You lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and stagger back, clutching your frostbitten arm to your chest. You have lost your weapon and the cyclone is growing stronger and stronger, forcing you to retreat towards a corner of the temple.

<p>You sprint along the ice bridge and dive for Dyce’s hand, but it is too late. Barely a second before you reach him his grip falters and he plummets backwards into the gaping void. A shiver runs down your spine as his scream fades into the darkness below. You are staring helplessly into the gorge when Irian begins to shout: ‘There, over there—I’m sure I saw something.’</p>

<p>The body of the Helghast bubbles and dissolves at your feet, a vile green gas seeping out from beneath its robes. As you stare in revulsion at the decomposing corpse, you suddenly realize that this foul creature must have been sent here to kill Vonotar—there can be no other reason for its being here. The Darklords of Helgedad crave Vonotar’s death in payment for his failure at the Battle of Holmgulf and have discovered his whereabouts. The wizard must have discovered the Helghast and imprisoned it within the pentacle until he could devise a way of permanently destroying it.</p>
<p>You gingerly touch your wounded throat and thank the gods that you possess the Sommerswerd; its powers have once again saved your life. Turning into the main corridor, you quickly leave behind the smoking remains.</p>

<p>The chill air whistles past, and then you suddenly crash onto a ledge of ice, over thirty feet below. You are winded and badly shaken, but still conscious. The cries of your guides soon change to shouts of joy and amazement when they see you stagger to your feet. You look upwards to see Fenor leap safely across the crevasse. Seconds later, a rope is thrown down and you are pulled to safety.</p>
<p>You have lost your Kanu-dogs, your sledge with its provisions, and 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. After an anxious discussion, your guides agree to continue the mission, although they know that the hardships will now be doubly severe. Then in the distance, Irian spots a narrow passage at the edge of the ice shelf at a point where it meets the Hrod Basin. You continue your journey, and by nightfall you have reached the shelter of this pass and decide to set up camp.</p>
<p>Checking the remaining food stores, you realize that rations will have to be cut by half if all of you are to reach Ikaya. You lose another 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point due to the scant evening meal.</p>

In the bitterness of defeat, they sought to destroy Vonotar for his crime of failure. Vonotar knew that I possessed the only means to effect an escape from their vengeance, for my Guildstaff has the power of teleportation. He tried to steal it and flee to the safety of Ikaya by himself, but he learnt that its power is not for all men to share; only I am blessed with its secret. He was angry and would have murdered my kinspeople had I not agreed to bring him here, so I had no choice but to do so.’</p>

<p>As the light gradually fades, a blizzard blows across the open ice shelf and batters relentlessly against the tent. The flapping canvas and the pain in your fingers and toes are beginning to wear on your nerves; you wish you had never set foot in this icy hell. Then, in the middle of the night, the wind rips away the edge of the canvas and the full force of the gale scatters your equipment and provisions. You are forced to spend the rest of the night on your elbows, clinging with frozen fingers to the edge of the tent. Your sleeping furs fill with a half frozen slush, and, by dawn, your clothes are stiff with ice. You lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>The following day, a strong wind rises from the north. Hour upon hour, it blows relentlessly into your face. The Ljuk ice shelf becomes a mass of twisted slabs of ice, jutting upwards at every angle. Progress is slow and difficult. By midday, you are shivering with cold; your lips are cracked and bleeding and the icy blasts have covered you with a thin film of snow.</p>
<p>You steer your sledge through a narrow passage at the edge of the ice shelf where it meets the Hrod Basin. Here you are sheltered from the wind, and for the first time today you can see ahead quite clearly.</p>

<p>You have fallen over a hundred-and-fifty feet into a massive snow drift. You are shaken and winded but otherwise unharmed. It takes nearly half an hour to tunnel your way clear and when you finally stagger out of the powdery snow, you are astounded by the sight that greets you. A huge underground cavern spreads into the distance. Stalactites of crystal hang from the icy ceiling and the constant dripping of melting snow fills this ice world with an eerie, musical sound. You are looking at an uncharted world that few Sommlending have ever seen, for you have fallen into the caverns of Kalte. This chamber is a tiny part of a massive underground labyrinth built by the Ancients, many ages before the Sommlending or even the Darklords set foot in Magnamund. Its wide avenues, temples, and halls once echoed with the sound of a race of creatures for whom the ice was a natural home. M’lare bowls still hang from the roof, bathing the chamber with their eternal light.</p>
<p>You shout towards the opening high above, but there is no reply. Irian and Fenor have given you up for dead, and they are now trying to make their way back to the <cite>Cardonal</cite>.</p>

<p>The gale dies away during the night and dawn arrives calm and still. On the horizon to the far north, you can see Ikaya, the ice fortress. The huge crystal-towered stronghold is a wondrous sight, made all the more marvellous because it appears to hover upside down upon a large cloud. ‘Kalte mirage,’ says Dyce. ‘There’s no dust in the air here—the land is reflected in the clouds. That’s Ikaya, but the real fortress is over the horizon. It cannot be more than forty miles away now.’ Dyce grabs a spade and starts to dig out the Kanu-dogs that have been buried by snow. You wake the others and eat a meal before setting off once more.</p>
<p>It is midday when you reach the edge of a deep gorge. It is over forty feet wide, and there appears to be no way of crossing it. You are forced to travel along the gorge to the east. Eventually, after three miles, you discover a narrow ice bridge. However, the centre of the bridge is frighteningly thin and narrow: it looks incapable of supporting the weight of a loaded sledge.</p>

<p>Great chunks of ice are falling away from the underside of the bridge, and a wide split appears. You manage to keep the sledge on course and reach the far side of the gorge, but you soon discover that a sledge runner is broken and irreparable. You are forced to abandon the sledge and continue on foot, but it still contains some useful equipment. Some of this you may take and store in your Backpack (remembering your maximum of eight items in total):</p>

<p>Fenor, Irian, and Dyce quickly follow you across, but as they reach the centre of the bridge, disaster strikes. Dyce catches his foot in the cracked surface and trips. You watch in horror as he slips over the edge. But he catches the edge and hangs on by his fingertips.</p>

You have lost your dog team, your sledge, and most of your food, but at least you are still alive.</p>
<p>You and Fenor jump the widening gap and join the rest of your party. After much discussion, the guides agree to continue with the mission even though the hardships will now be doubly severe. In the distance, you see a narrow passage at the edge of the ice shelf where it meets the Hrod Basin. By nightfall, you reach the shelter of this icy pass and camp there for the night.

As the doorway behind you is now sealed, it seems you have no alternative but to launch a surprise attack and attempt to capture Vonotar. Steeling yourself, you charge.</p>

<p>Your transport to Ikaya consists of two sledges, each drawn by a team of six Kanu-dogs. This sturdy breed is native to Kalte, and they make ideal sledge dogs. Their thick tawny coats and powerful chests, as well as their vigour and enthusiasm even in the coldest climates, make them well suited to the work ahead.</p>
<p>On board each sledge is enough food and equipment for the mission. Your three guides, Irian, Fenor, and Dyce, are all experienced trappers. They are skilled at survival in the icy desert, and know of the many unseen dangers.</p>
<p>Once the dogs are harnessed, you and Dyce climb aboard your sledge and signal to the others to lead the way. As you stare across the frozen expanse of the Ljuk ice shelf, you can see a white glare on the distant horizon. This is the Viad Glacier wall, the point where the flow of ice meets the frozen sea. Through the crisp, clear air of Kalte it looks no more than six miles away at most, but in reality it is nearer sixty miles away.</p>
<p>You make good progress on the first day and as darkness approaches, you decide to set up camp for the night. You halt inside a circle of ice pillars that have been forced upwards by the constantly moving ice shelf. The sledges are drawn together and the tent is erected beside them. Once the canvas is secured and the Kanu-dogs have been settled for the night, you begin to prepare your evening meal. Suddenly, a terrifying roar is heard outside the tent.</p>
<p>‘By the gods!’ cries Irian. ‘A Baknar!’</p>
<p>Baknar are large carnivorous creatures that dwell near the Kalte coastline. Their usual prey are gallings or the smaller ostrels that live at the sea’s edge. But this Baknar has been attracted by the scent of the dogs. It is about to attack and eat several of your sledge dog team.</p>

They hang helplessly in their harnesses, howling and kicking at the air. Dyce frantically pulls on the reins to try to prevent the others from falling as well, but his efforts are in vain.

<p>The Hall of the Brumalmarc is a vast chamber constructed of crystal blocks rising to a central plateau. On this stands the Brumalmarc throne, as old as Ikaya itself. There, Vonotar sits, surrounded by the tomes and eldritch trappings of a necromancer. He is rapt in study and does not see you enter the hall. He remains oblivious to your presence until Loi-Kymar sneezes.</p>
<p>‘Who dares disturb me?’ he hisses, rising from the Brumalmarc throne, his eyes searching for an intruder. Upon seeing you, he emits a horrified gasp and fumbles for his black staff. He has the look of a criminal who has been discovered in the act of some dreadful crime. Quickly you raise your weapon and begin to climb the crystal pyramid. You know that you have little time to reach him if you are to overpower and capture him alive.</p>
<p>You reach the edge of the plateau in time to see a wide circle of blocks descending around the throne. Between you and Vonotar, a deep moat is forming. Then from the depths of the moat you hear a ghastly, inhuman gibbering. You brace yourself for combat but are totally unprepared for the horror that now faces you. From out of the dark slithers a huge, ghoulish, green monster. Its deformed head is a mass of tentacles and suckers that ooze a putrid black slime. At the centre of this writhing mass a hideous yellow eye pulsates. Vonotar has control over this monster and he is directing it towards you.</p>

The terrain becomes very broken with drifts of snow hiding the razor-sharp ridges and undulations of the ice beneath. For the Ice Barbarian scouts with their skis (fashioned from the ribs of Kalte mammoths), the treacherous surface presents no problems. But to cross it on foot is a slow and painful ordeal.</p>
<p>The biting wind whips across the glacier, bringing with it clouds of fine snow that obscure your vision. You realize the danger of being caught in the open in the middle of a Kalte blizzard, and signal to the others to call off the chase.

<p>The next day, thick snow clouds have descended over the Ljuk ice shelf and there is little wind. As you draw closer to the edge of the glacier, the surface of the ice shelf becomes very rough and broken. Slabs of solid ice jut out at every angle, forming difficult obstacles. You are forced to dismount from the sledges and manhandle them across the hummocks and ridges, as you try to reach the smoother slope of the distant Viad Glacier.</p>

<p>Irian fetches the sleeping furs from the sledge and you all prepare for a good night’s sleep. The only clothes you ever remove are your boots—the few days that you have spent in this desolate land have taught you much about survival. As you take off your boots, you take care to leave them in the shape of your feet: in these temperatures, your soft boots soon freeze as hard as stone, making them agony to put on next morning if you don’t. Unlacing the boots requires bare fingers, and you constantly have to pause and thrust your hands back into your mittens to avoid frostbite setting in. Curled up in your furs, your teeth chattering, and the wind howling outside, you eventually fall into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>You have covered less than a mile when the first of the Ice Barbarian scouts appear to the north on skis. At first, there are only two of the fearsome warriors, but they are soon joined by three others. They are large, muscular, and bedecked with furs. Some of them wear bone armour. Despite their size, they glide across the snow with an almost feline grace and speed. Each of them has a pole attached to his back from which a small flag flutters.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bone-tipped arrow whistles past your knee and embeds itself in the sledge. An Ice Barbarian scout skis past to your right. He is less than ten yards away and you can clearly see his slanted eyes and sharp cheek-bones. You suddenly realize that what you had mistaken for muscle and fur is in fact an Ice Barbarian child. Each scout is carrying a large backpack containing a small child. These children are armed with small bone bows, and they fire a constant stream of arrows as their fathers ski nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>The next day is bitterly cold. A strong wind from the west blows relentlessly as you steer your sledge towards the Hrod Basin. The snow clogs your eyes and your lips crack and bleed, but by midday you reach the edge of the basin. Irian and Dyce’s sledge arrives at the ice wall first and they eagerly encourage you onwards.</p>
<p>Without any warning, a great crack appears between the two sledges, opening with a tremendous roar, until you are faced by a huge dark crevasse. Frantically you pull on the reins but it is too late to prevent your Kanu-dog team from disappearing into the void. Your sledge is left balancing on the edge of the crevasse, while the team of howling Kanu-dogs dangle helplessly in their harnesses below you. Very carefully, you risk a glance into the chasm. You see that the first two dogs have broken free and dropped over one-hundred-and-fifty feet to a ledge below. One of them appears to be dead. The other is badly injured and whimpers beside the still body of its comrade. Suddenly, a shudder jolts the sledge and you gasp with fright.</p>

<p>You notice that the stone passage ascends to a landing where another passage branches off to the east. M’lare bowls hang at regular intervals along the arched ceiling, their unnatural light illuminating the carved walls.</p>
<p>As you approach the landing, you notice an archway leading into a small room beyond. A strange sight meets your eyes. Ragged furs, pottery shards, and the debris of hundreds of years seem to have been thrown into this chamber. A large lever protrudes from the wall beside the archway.</p>

<p>Dyce volunteers to return to the <cite>Cardonal</cite> with the Kanu-dog teams and the sledge, while the rest of you push on towards Ikaya, the ice fortress.</p>
<p>Ikaya was carved out of the Hrod Range many ages ago, by a race of creatures that have long since disappeared. Thousands of years passed before the Ice Barbarians migrated here from the Uncharted Void, claiming Ikaya for themselves. Their leaders, the ‘Brumalmarc’ as they are called, have ruled over Kalte from the safe shelter of this fortress ever since.</p>
<p>You have covered nearly five miles when Irian suddenly points to the west. ‘There…over there. I’m sure I saw something.’</p>
<p>You halt and strain your eyes to try to identify something unusual in the monotonous landscape of ice and snow.</p>
<p>‘Look over there!’ shouts Fenor, pointing towards a ridge less than a mile away. Two fur-clad warriors are standing on top of a large slab of ice. They are staring at you.</p>
<p>‘Ice Barbarians!’ whispers Irian, his voice shaking with fear. ‘If they beat us to Ikaya, we’re as good as dead.’</p>

<p>In the distance you can see a narrow passage at the edge of the ice shelf where it joins the Hrod Basin. By nightfall, you have reached the shelter of this narrow pass and decide to set up camp.

<p>A haze of fine snow obscures your vision. On two occasions, Fenor and Irian slip into crevasses and have to be pulled out by their safety ropes. Then your sledge meets with a similar mishap. Dyce volunteers to be lowered into the crevasse on the end of a rope, and unloads the damaged sledge so that it is light enough to be hauled out. After two hours of backbreaking effort, the sledge is dragged from the void, but only for you to discover that it is damaged beyond repair and will have to be abandoned.</p>
<p>A gale rises from the west, and blows so fiercely that you have difficulty in standing. Within a few minutes, the conditions have become so bad that you are obliged to pitch a tent and wait for the gale to die down. Hour after hour, the wind buffets the tent relentlessly.

<p>It may be of consolation to learn that your body is soon discovered by an Ice Barbarian guard, who presents it (together with the Doomstone) to Vonotar.

You quickly climb out of your sleeping furs and stare out over the icy landscape. The Kalte air is fresh and clear. You see a strong mirage in the distance that seems to throw the land up much higher than it could possibly be.</p>
<p>‘We should make it to “The Rock” by nightfall,’ says Fenor, as he busily pulls a reluctant Kanu-dog into its harness. ‘Best to make camp there tonight. The shelter is good; this far from the sea, a blizzard can whip across the shelf from nowhere in a few minutes. I’ve known trappers to be blown for miles if they’re careless or unlucky enough to be caught out on the shelf with no cover.’</p>

Each vat is full of bubbling slime writhing and contorting as if it were alive.</p>
<p>Fear and revulsion grip your stomach as you begin to grasp the sinister secret of this hall. Row upon row of stone plinths bear the mutilated corpses of Ice Barbarians, their skins peeled back and pinned open.

<p>You follow the twisting ice passage for many miles until you stumble upon a grotto. A small melt-water stream divides the cavern and another passage leads off towards the north.

If you wish to keep the Blue Stone Triangle, put it around your neck and tuck it into your jacket. Mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.</p>

<p>As you race across the slippery surface, the ice begins to crack. Glancing behind, you see the Kalkoth has stopped at the edge of the lake. It seems to be terrified of the dark shadow that you saw earlier under the ice; the shadow that has just reappeared less than twenty feet from where you are now. With panic rising in your throat, you turn and run, praying all the way for the ice and your luck to hold out.</p>

<p>As the vile Akraa’Neonor dies at your feet, you glimpse the hunchback descending from his platform and scurrying off towards a distant door. You turn to chase him but freeze when you see the body of Loi-Kymar lying motionless below. He is dead, killed in psychic combat with the traitor. With anger welling up inside, you raise your weapon and sprint after Vonotar, now intent upon his death.</p>

<p>The next morning arrives bright and windless. The sun pierces the thin layer of cloud, bathing the east in a soft pink glow. This beautiful vision reminds you that your Kai masters once told you that the light of Kalte is unlike anywhere else in Magnamund. With tent and equipment packed, you leave the pass and venture out onto the Hrod Basin; one hundred miles of open ice now lie between you and Storm Giant Pass.</p>
<p>At first, the journey is easy. The Basin has been worn smooth by the wind and no crevasses lurk unseen beneath the hard, dense snow. But at dawn on the third day, events take a turn for the worse. You are awoken from a deep sleep by Dyce shaking your shoulder. He is frightened. ‘What’s wrong?’ you ask, still bleary-eyed and sleepy.</p>
<p>‘Ice Barbarians…on the horizon. Twenty, maybe more. Five wind sledges and a warrior escort. I think they’ve seen us.’</p>
<p>In an instant, you have all climbed out of your sleeping furs and begun to pack away the tent. Dyce is correct, they are Ice Barbarians and they are heading towards you from the west. ‘If they catch us, we’re as good as dead,’ says Fenor, as he ties the last of the equipment to the sledge.</p>
<p>The Ice Barbarians of Kalte are a fierce and war-like race of nomads. For thousands of years they have travelled this icy wasteland, trapping furs and herding mammoths. Their only contact with the rest of Magnamund is through the trading post of Ljuk. In summer, when the coast around Ljuk is free from ice, they journey there to trade their furs for weapons and tools, as there is no iron or wood in Kalte. They hate all except their own kind, and kill anyone they find who dares to trespass in their icy domain. You soon hear their war-cries less than three miles distant, and for the first time since you landed, you pray for a blizzard to hide your escape.</p>

<p>In spite of his frail physique, the man climbs with surprising speed and dexterity. You pull him through the portal and retrieve your Rope. ‘The stairs,’ he says, pointing into the darkness. ‘Our escape lies that way, but you had best take the lead; my eyes ail me. I have suffered the snow-blindness and my vision is just a blur.’</p>
<p>You pack your Rope and lead the way along the passage. You are about to descend the stairs when a pair of skeletal hands close around your throat from behind. A hideous cry betrays the ‘merchant’s’ true identity. He is a Helghast, a deadly shape-changing servant of the Darklords, and he has tricked you into releasing him from his cell. He is intent on murdering you.</p>
<p>You desperately gasp for air as the skeletal fingers tear and burn at your throat. You lose 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you are still alive, you can break free from his steely grip.

<p>You can sense the presence of a powerful life-force beyond the misty arch. As you concentrate, you suddenly recall a tale told to you when you were a small child, ‘The Legend of the Vagadyn Gate’. This was a tale of Ice Demons and how they once fought a war to be able to leave their world and come to Kalte. They were formless creatures, without shape and substance, and existed as pure energy in another dimension, beyond the confines of space and time. The Ice Demons discovered the Vagadyn gate, a sort of door between their world and Magnamund; they fought each other to enter this gate, unaware of the fate that awaited them. The Ancients had also discovered the gate. As the Ice Demons passed through the Vagadyn, their spirits were imprisoned in crystals by the cunning Ancients, who harnessed the power of the Ice Demons to build Ikaya. The M’lare bowls that light the fortress each contain the spirits of lesser Ice Demons trapped within. You also remember that the tale warns against destroying the crystal prisons: if an Ice Demon is released it will seek to claim the body of its rescuer.</p>
