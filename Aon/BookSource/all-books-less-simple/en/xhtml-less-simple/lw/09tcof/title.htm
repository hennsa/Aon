<div class="frontmatter">

  <p>You are Lone Wolf—the last Kai Master of Sommerlund. The shadow of war sweeps across the continent of Magnamund as your mortal enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad, redouble their efforts to defeat your Magnakai quest. You dare not delay. Already their armoured legions are converging on a city beneath whose streets lies hidden the object of your quest: the Lorestone of Tahou.</p>

  <p>In <strong><cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite></strong>, you must stay one step ahead of your foes as you search for the Lorestone in a fantastic metropolis built during the dawn of Magnamund.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies—the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power, known as the Lorestones of Nyxator, and upon their discovery he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and his experiences in a great tome entitled <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, thereby ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge, you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over one thousand years ago. By doing so successfully, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai, which is held within the Lorestones’ crystal forms.</p>
<p>Already your quest has taken you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master, you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians that aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that one of the seven Lorestones was still present in their land, hidden deep inside an island stronghold known as Kazan-Oud, or Castle Death. You survived the perils of Castle Death and emerged triumphant, having achieved what the Elder Magi had believed to be impossible. During the victory celebrations held in your honour, you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had been expecting your coming. An ancient Dessi legend tells of the birth and rise to greatness of two <i xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</i>, which means ‘sons of the sun’. One was named <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</i>, which means ‘eagle’, and the other was named <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</i>, which means ‘wolf’. A prophecy foretold that the <i xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</i> would both come from the north to seek the council of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose, and one destiny—to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril. Your victory at Kazan-Oud proved that you were <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</i>—the wolf of Dessi legend—and in keeping with their ancient vows the Elder Magi promised to help you complete the Magnakai quest.</p>
<p>In Elzian, the capital of Dessi, you were tutored in the histories of Magnamund and received lessons in lore that you would have learned from Kai Masters if only they, like you, had survived the murderous Darklord attack on the Kai Monastery eleven years ago. You were eager to learn all that your tutor, Lord Rimoah, could teach you in preparation for the next stage of your quest, but grim news from the Darklands cut short your tuition. In the Darklord city of Helgedad a civil war had erupted, following your defeat of Haakon, Archlord of the Black City. After five years, the battle for the throne of Helgedad had finally been won by a Darklord called Gnaag. The other Darklords, now united behind this new leader, were ordered to amass huge armies in preparation for the conquest of Magnamund. So swiftly did their Giak legions grow in numbers that the Elder Magi ceased their counselling and arranged for you to begin at once the search for the third Lorestone. Guided by Lord Paido, a warrior-magician of Dessi, you set off on a perilous journey across the Freelands of Talestria on your way to the jungle-swamps of the Danarg. There, in an ancient temple that was once the Elder Magi’s most sacred place of worship, you succeeded in discovering the object of your quest. However, during your escape from the Danarg, your guide, Lord Paido, was captured by Darklord agents, and upon your return to Elzian you learned the fearful news that the Darklords were now waging open war throughout Magnamund. Several lands, after brief but futile resistance, had been overrun completely by Darkland armies; others had surrendered without fighting in the face of their determined might, and sadly there were others who chose to betray former friends and allies by joining the Darklord cause, in the misguided hope that they would share in the spoils of victory, following the triumph of Darklord Gnaag. One such land was Vassagonia, a powerful desert realm to the north of Dessi. Already her armies had invaded the neighbouring territories of Casiorn and Cloeasia, and were preparing to march through the Republic of Anari in order to join Gnaag’s horde now advancing across the plain of Slovia. The thought of such an eventuality filled the Elder Magi with dread, for the Lorestone you must find next lies deep below the streets of Tahou, the capital of Anari, in an ancient city built during the dawn of Magnamund. If Tahou were to fall before your arrival the chances of you completing your quest successfully would be slim indeed, even for a warrior of your renowned skill and daring.</p>
<p>Whilst preparations were being made for your journey you learned that the Darklords had attacked and captured Ruanon, the southernmost province of your homeland of Sommerlund. The news of this calamity shook your resolve and filled you with the desire to forego the journey to Tahou and return home without delay. The Elder Magi implored you not to abandon your quest and you faced a difficult and crucial decision. Which should you honour: your vow to complete the Magnakai quest or your oath of loyalty to your King, an oath which pledged your service in the defence of the sun-realm? Fortunately, the surprise arrival of an old friend was to decide the matter for you. Magemaster Banedon, envoy of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star—the Magicians’ Guild of Sommerlund—landed unexpectedly at Elzian aboard his flying ship Skyrider. He and his dwarven crew were warmly greeted, for Banedon, a frequent and favoured visitor to Dessi, was highly respected by the Elder Magi for his mastery of new magic. Six years had passed since last you met and there was much you wished to discuss and reminisce about, but there was an urgent matter of duty to perform first. Banedon had been sent by King Ulnar of Sommerlund to deliver into your hand a royal missive concerning your quest. The scroll, written and sealed by the King himself, ordered you to pursue the Magnakai quest above all other duties. It ended with the words: ‘Sommerlund has suffered a grievous defeat at Ruanon, but the will of the people is undaunted and the strength of our army undiminished. Boldly we will resist our enemies so long as there is hope of the rebirth of the Kai.’</p>
<p>Banedon informed you that the King had ordered that he and his skyship be placed under your command. He also delivered the news that the King had bestowed upon you the rank of Warmarshall of the Royal Estates. Proudly you accepted from Banedon two platinum badges, each crafted in the shape of a blazing sun, and affixed them to the collar of your Kai tunic. They signified that you were now a general of the Sommlending army, the youngest general there had ever been. The honour bestowed upon you lifted your spirits, and the news that Banedon would be joining your quest helped greatly to allay your fear of the dangers that lay ahead. For two years Banedon had lived in Tahou as Journeymaster to his guild; his knowledge of the city and of the Tahou Cauldron, the entrance to the ancient metropolis, which lies buried deep beneath the city streets, would be especially useful.</p>
<p>On the eve of your journey to Tahou, the Elder Magi convened a meeting of the High Council. A golden torch was lit and placed in the centre of their great cylindrical council chamber as a symbol of their hopes and prayers for your success.</p>
<p>‘This torch shall burn so long as you, Lone Wolf, pursue your destiny along the path of the Magnakai,’ said Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council. Before the gathering of Elders you reaffirmed your vow to restore the Kai and, as if kindled by a sudden gust of wind, the torch flared brightly, bathing the chamber in its vivid golden glow. As one, the Elders rose from their seats and intoned their blessing: ‘May the Gods Ishir and Kai protect you on your journey into darkness, <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Kor-Skarn</i>.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to Book 9. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You many choose one bonus <a href="#discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> adventure you successfully complete (Books 6–12).</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Magnakai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
<p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called ‘Lore-circles’. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. (See the section ‘<a href="#lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a>’ for details of these bonuses.)</p>
<p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wpnmstry">Weaponmastery</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 3 to any number that you choose from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="310" width="386" src="weapons.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The fact that you are skilled with three weapons does not mean that you begin the adventure carrying any of them. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons during your adventure. For every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> book that you complete in the Magnakai series, you may add an additional weapon to your <a href="#action">Weaponmastery Checklist</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponmastery: +3 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, and tick your chosen weapons on the <a href="#action">Weapons List</a>. You cannot carry more than two Weapons.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlctrl">Animal Control</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to communicate with most animals and to determine their purpose and intentions. It also enables a Kai Master to fight from the saddle with great advantage.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Control’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="curing">Curing</a></h4>

<p>The possessor of this skill can restore 1 lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to his total for every numbered section of the book through which he passes, provided he is not involved in combat. (This can only be done after his <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) This Magnakai Discipline also enables a Kai Master to cure disease, blindness, and any combat wounds sustained by others, as well as himself. Using the knowledge that mastery of this skill provides will also allow a Kai Master to identify the properties of any herbs, roots, and potions that may be encountered during the adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Curing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="invsblty">Invisibility</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai skill allows a Kai Master to blend in with his surroundings, even in the most exposed terrain. It will enable him to mask his body heat and scent, and to adopt the dialect and mannerisms of any town or city that he visits.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Invisibility’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hntmstry">Huntmastery</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Master will never starve in the wild; he will always be able to hunt for food, even in areas of wasteland and desert. It also enables a Kai Master to move with great speed and dexterity and will allow him to ignore any extra loss of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points due to a surprise attack or ambush.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Huntmastery’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="pthmnshp">Pathsmanship</a></h4>

<p>In addition to the basic skill of being able to recognize the correct path in unknown territory, the Magnakai skill of Pathsmanship will enable a Kai Master to read foreign languages, decipher symbols, read footprints and tracks (even if they have been disturbed), and detect the presence of most traps. It also grants him the gift of always knowing intuitively the position of north.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Pathsmanship’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psisurge">Psi-surge</a></h4>

<p>This psychic skill enables a Kai Master to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used as well as normal combat weapons and adds 4 extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. A weaker form of Psi-surge called <cite>Mindblast</cite> can be used against an enemy without losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, but it will add only 2 extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. (Psi-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.) Psi-surge cannot be used if your <small>ENDURANCE</small> falls to 6 points or below, and not all of the creatures encountered on your adventure will be affected by it; you will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Psi-surge: +4 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points but −2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points per round’ and ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psiscrn">Psi-screen</a></h4>

<p>Many of the hostile creatures that inhabit Magnamund have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack and greatly increases your defence against supernatural illusions and hypnosis.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Psi-screen: no points lost when attacked by Mindforce’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="nexus">Nexus</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Magnakai skill will enable you to withstand extremes of heat and cold without losing <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and to move items by your powers of concentration alone.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Nexus’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="dvnation">Divination</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Master of imminent or unseen danger or enable him to detect an invisible or hidden enemy. It may also reveal the true purpose or intent of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure. Divination may enable you to communicate telepathically with another person and to sense if a creature possesses psychic abilities.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Divination’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 9 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you may add a further Magnakai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in Book 10. This additional skill, together with your other Magnakai skills and any Special Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures may then be used in the next adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> series, which is called <a href="../../lw/10tdot/title.htm#title"><cite>The Dungeons of Torgar</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before leaving Dessi on your journey to the city of Tahou, the Elder Magi give you a <a href="#map">map of the Republic of Anari</a> and its surrounding lands, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed books 1–8 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. You can carry a maximum of only fifty Crowns, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.</p>
<p>The Elder Magi offer you a choice of equipment to aid you on your perilous mission. You can take five items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess. However, remember that you can carry a maximum of two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.</p>

<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You do not need to make notes, but you should refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Bow—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Quiver—slung over your shoulder.</li>
<li>Rope—carried in the Backpack.</li>

</ul>
<h4><a name="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of only eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd><p>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</p>
<p>The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve. Surplus Special Items may be left for safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given initial capitals (e.g. Gold Dagger, Magic Pendant) in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember that you can only carry two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bow and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is strongly recommended that you also equip yourself with a close combat weapon, like a Sword or Mace.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
If you enter combat armed only with a Bow, you must deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at anytime.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, you may already possess Special Items.<br /><br />
The maximum number of Special Items that a Kai Master can carry during an adventure is twelve. Surplus Special Items may be left in safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Anari is the Lune, but Gold Crowns are readily accepted at an exchange rate of four Lune for every 1 Gold Crown.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 19.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Nightstalker’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (19 − 22 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as −3. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
<li>Nightstalker loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Magnakai Training</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles that are achieved by Kai Masters at each stage of their training. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> series, you will gain an additional Magnakai Discipline and progress towards the ultimate distinction of a Kai Warrior—Kai Grand Mastership.</p>

<li>Kai Grand Master</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></h3>

<p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called ‘Lore-circles’. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>), and their physical and mental stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
<p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
<dd>Weaponmastery &amp; Huntmastery</dd>
<dt>Circle of Light</dt>
<dd>Animal Control &amp; Curing</dd>
<dt>Circle of Solaris</dt>
<dd>Invisibility, Huntmastery &amp; Pathsmanship</dd>
<dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
<dd>Psi-surge, Psi-screen, Nexus &amp; Divination</dd>
</dl>
<p>By completing a Lore-circle, you may add to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> the extra bonus points that are shown below.</p>
<h4><a name="lcbonus">Lore-circle Bonuses</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
<dd>+1 <small>CS</small>+2 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of Light</dt>
<dd>0 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of Solaris</dt>
<dd>+1 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
<dd>+3 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>All bonus points that you acquire by completing a Lore-circle are additions to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores.</p>
<h3><a name="imprvdsc">Improved Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will steadily improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills), Tutelary (five skills), or Principalin (six skills), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>
<h4><a name="primate">Primate</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Primates with this Magnakai Discipline are able to repel an animal that is intent on harming them by blocking its sense of taste and smell. The level of success is dependent on the size and ferocity of the animal.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have the ability to delay the effects of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison he is able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and are able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Primates with the skill of Nexus will be able to offer a far greater resistance than before to the effects of noxious gases and fumes.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="tutelary">Tutelary</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to use defensive combat skills to great effect when fighting unarmed. When entering combat without a weapon, Tutelaries lose only 2 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, instead of the usual 4 points.</dd>
<dt>Invisibility</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to increase the effectiveness of their skill when hiding from an enemy by drawing the enemy’s attention to a place other than that in which they are hiding. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill can detect an enemy ambush within 500 yards of their position unless their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score is low due to wounds sustained or lack of food.</dd>
<dt>Psi-screen</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill develop mental defences against magical charms and hostile telepathy. These defences increase in strength as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Divination</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries who possess this Magnakai Discipline are able to recognize objects or creatures with magical skills or abilities. However, this improved Discipline can be negated if the creature or object is shielded from detection.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="prncpln">Principalin</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this skill are able to call on a woodland animal (if nearby) to aid them, either in combat, or to act as a messenger or guide. The number of animals that can be summoned increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Invisibility</dt>
<dd>Principalins are able to mask any sounds made by their movements while using this skill.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this Magnakai Discipline are able to intensify their eyesight at will, giving them telescopic vision.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Principalins using this skill in combat are able to confuse an enemy by planting seeds of doubt in its mind. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this ability can extinguish fires by force of will alone. The size of the fire, and the number that can be extinguished using Nexus increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Magnakai Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Magnakai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your search for the Lorestone of Tahou will be fraught with danger. The Darklords have launched a massive invasion into the freelands of Magnamund in a bid to take over the continent and thwart your Magnakai quest. Make notes as you progress through the story—they will be of great help in this and future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will help you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>Choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak his initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.</p>
<p>The future of Northern Magnamund now hinges on the success of this quest. May the spirit of your ancestors guide you on the path of the Magnakai.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>A full moon lights the sky above Elzian on the evening you begin your journey to Tahou. Its ashen rays glimmer along the polished wooden outriggers that run the length of the hull of the <cite>Skyrider</cite>, and illuminate the crystal star ensign and the Sommlending flag as it flutters proudly from the mizzen-mast. The Elders of the High Council have gathered on the roof of their council chamber and, as you and Banedon climb the boarding ladder to the skyship, you pause to return their farewell salute. Bo’sun Nolrim, senior member of Banedon’s crew of dwarves, welcomes you and his captain aboard. Surveying the craft, you notice that the <cite>Skyrider</cite> has changed very little since you were last aboard her, when you sailed the desert skies of Vassagonia in search of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>. The crew remember that voyage fondly and are justly proud of the part they played in the success of that perilous mission. ‘Take the helm, bo’sun, and set a course for Navasari!’ commands Banedon, as he leads you across the busy deck to his cabin at the prow.</p>
<p>Swiftly the lights of Elzian vanish as the <cite>Skyrider</cite> speeds into the night. A mile below, the jungle of Dessi and the barren peaks of the Xulun Mountains race past beneath the keel, but in the comforting warmth of Banedon’s cabin you feel no sensation of movement; only the hum of the powerful engine indicates how rapidly you are travelling. Over a delicious meal of salt beef and spiced fruit, Banedon explains the purpose of your journey to Navasari, a city that lies over a hundred miles south of Tahou. ‘Our enemies are advancing across Magnamund like a tidal wave, destroying or carrying with them all in their path,’ says the blond-haired magician, pointing to a map of the continent that adorns the cabin wall. ‘Every day a new battle is being fought, and every day we lose another town or village to the Darklords. Before we venture into Tahou we must be sure that the city has not already fallen to Darklord Gnaag, lest we fly straight into a trap. I have many friends in Navasari, reliable friends, friends who are highly placed in the Senate of Anari. From them we will learn if the city still stands, and if it does, how long we can expect it to resist a Darklord assault.’</p>
<p>Mid-morning of the following day, the lookout catches a glimpse of Navasari as the <cite>Skyrider</cite> emerges from the Yajo Pass. Banedon takes control of the helm and steers the craft towards the east quarter of the city, landing it on the spacious roof of a magnificent, star-shaped building that overlooks the River Chah. A group of dignitaries, resplendent in high-necked robes of green and yellow silk, greet your arrival: these are some of the friends of whom Banedon spoke. Sadly they recount the grim course of events that has recently befallen their country. In the far north, the town of Resa was destroyed and its people massacred by an army of Giaks. Two days later, a similar attack was launched by a Vassagonian army against the town of Zila. They swept along the Anari Pass, burning and looting every village through which they rode, and giving no quarter to those who dared resist them. And three days ago, on the western border, a fierce battle was fought at the Slovian town of Lovka for control of the bridge across the River Churdas. Shortly before midnight the might of Darklord Gnaag’s horde fell upon the beleaguered garrison. They fought bravely, but by the dawn of the following day, all that remained of the town and its defenders were an acre of scorched earth and a cart full of charred bones. The three enemy armies are now advancing towards Tahou. President Toltuda, the head of state, has ordered the evacuation of all women and children from the capital, and has begun strengthening the city’s defences to increase its chances of withstanding the impending siege. When Banedon tells of your intention to go to Tahou, one of his friends offers a few words of caution. ‘It would be unwise to attempt a landing at the capital,’ he warns. ‘Heavy bolt throwers have been positioned on every rooftop and tower in case the city is attacked from the air. The Darklords captured Suentina in such a fashion and the Tahouese have learnt from their neighbour’s misfortune. Skyships rarely visit Tahou, which makes it all the more likely that your craft would be mistaken for a hostile attacker.’</p>
<p>After long deliberation, you and Banedon decide to leave the <cite>Skyrider</cite> in Navasari and journey to Tahou by horse. Nolrim is left in charge of the craft and crew with instructions to wait here for your return. If Tahou is besieged and he has not received word from you after two weeks, he is to return to Dessi and report that your quest has failed.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="107" width="386" src="small6.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Early next morning, you and Banedon climb into the saddles of two white Anarian steeds provided by his friends, and set off on your two-day ride to Tahou. Less than an hour after leaving Navasari you see a long line of wagons approaching. They are escorted by a troop of cavalry, and each one is crowded with women and children.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>You look upon the city of Tahou from the balcony of a tall tower, the spire of the Thalis Temple, situated at the heart of the Rainbow Park. It is noon, but there is no brightness in this day, for a grey blanket of smoke covers the sky. Below you lies a shattered city, its once proud buildings now seething infernos, its streets and squares choked with rubble. Hasty defences have been constructed where the city wall is holed or fallen, and the battlements to the north and east are covered with unburied dead.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="107" width="386" src="small6.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Beyond the wall, the flats lie shrouded in a mist that curls like the smoke of a thousand campfires. Its thickness is unnatural and you sense at once that it has been conjured to hide the enemy. You leave the tower and make your own way through the burning streets towards the West District, where the fighting at the wall is fiercest. You pass the smouldering ruins of the Anarium and take a fire-swept street that leads to the West Gate. A building at the end of this street is being used as a shelter for the wounded. The roof has caught fire and a handful of soldiers are trying desperately to evacuate the wounded before it collapses.</p>

<p>You leap from your hiding place like a tiger pouncing on its prey. Miraculously, the guard manages to parry your first blow, but he is awestruck by your skill with a blade. He retreats towards the strongroom as you press your attack.</p>

<p>The shock of the fall and the numbing chill of the icy black water conspire to sap your strength. You flail and flounder in the deep until you are gripped by cramp and can no longer resist your doom. Unconsciousness smothers your pain as you sink slowly to the bottom of the lake, weighed down by your equipment and the freezing water that now fills your lungs.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>

<p>You tie one end of the rope to the bottom rung and drop the rest into the darkness. Seconds later you hear it strike stone and you realize that you will not have too far to descend. As you climb down the rope, you pass through a layer of mist that glows with a curious blue-green luminescence. Twenty feet below the mist your feet touch firm ground.

<p>As the hour of noon approaches, the rutted highway of khaki-coloured earth rises gently towards a flat-topped house near the horizon. Outside, at the entrance, is a three-legged stand erected over a fire made of ghorkas’ dung. A battered tin pot full of soup hangs from the crotch of the stand, and a group of farm hands stand in line waiting for the muddy liquid to boil. The smell of the fire is awful, and it has to be blown on ceaselessly to prevent it from going out. Close to the house is a dirt track, which branches off the main highway and disappears to the west.

He smiles and turns to the President. ‘Sir, I feel I must make amends for my misguided action in the Senate. If Lone Wolf is to enter the Cauldron tonight, surely it is our duty to ensure that he is adequately equipped. I propose that we visit one of my warehouses, where he is free to take anything he requires.’</p>

The Elders asked me to afford you what protection I could and to help you in your quest for the Lorestone of Tahou.’</p>
<p>He leads you to a table, the surface of which is engraved with a huge map of the city. With a rod of glass he points to the location of the Tahou Cauldron: it is in the Square of the Dragons in the West District of the city. ‘The Cauldron is a funnel-shaped hollow with a circular shaft at its base. The shaft descends to the ruins of the ancient city of Zaaryx, 500 feet below Tahou. Legend tells us that the Lorestone was thrown into the Cauldron to prevent the Black Zakhan of Vassagonia from capturing it during the Great Khordaim War. The shaft was closed off and has remained sealed for the last 360 years.’</p>

He is with him now at his house on Leech Street. He is quite safe, but you must not delay your quest any further by going there yourself. At dawn the enemy will be at the gates of the city, and the battle for Tahou will have begun.

Tiny lights twinkle in countless windows and portals, adding to the splendour of the mighty capital.</p>

You glance upwards to see the faces of a dozen soldiers, peering down at you from behind a parapet that encircles the high enclosure walls.

<p>Silently you slip from the saddle and peer around the corner. In the middle of the street beyond, a company of Giak scouts are sifting through items they have looted from the village. Two of the evil creatures are loading their booty onto the back of a Kraan, a large, black-winged creature, while the others cram their ill-gotten gains in their pockets and packs. What they cannot carry they delight in despoiling, leaving behind a trail of filth and debris in the buildings they have ransacked.</p>
<p><i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Oka der!’</i> shouts their officer, brandishing a long, black sword with a jagged edge. <i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Akamaza ek!’</i> His greedy soldiers are reluctant to obey his commands, but a few blows with the flat of his blade quickly change their minds. Muttering and snarling, they scurry off into a side alley, reappearing a few minutes later astride large, grey wolves. <i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Rekenara kluz!’</i> growls the officer, and the pack ride out of the village, heading north along the bank of the River Churdas.</p>

<p>He and his mentor Chiban have been viewing the siege from this vantage point for the last three days.

Banedon recounts how the siege has progressed; how twice the enemy has broken into the city and been repelled by the determined defenders. Attacks from the air have set the city ablaze, but the enemy has lost great numbers of their flying Kraan, and now they are too weak to dare use the few that remain. The Anarium was destroyed in the first few hours of the siege and many senators lost their lives, including Senator Chil and President Toltuda.</p>

When Banedon explains your meeting with Lortha, and how he was once a student of Chiban, her husband, the sergeant somewhat reluctantly accepts your story and returns the Invitation. ‘Stay on the highway and make sure you reach Tahou by sunset,’ he says, as he signals to his troop to let you pass. ‘Enemy scouts have been sighted in the hills south of the capital.

<p>The courthouse of the Chief Magistrate is a grim, grey building. Devoid of any decoration or embellishment, its stark bare walls serve to remind the Tahouese of its sober purpose. It is a place where justice is meted out to wrongdoers. Harsh punishments are imposed: floggings and executions take place here every day of the week.

Three years have passed since you were last in the land of your birth, and you are hungry to hear all that has transpired since then.</p>

You decide to stay overnight and, as soon as you have stabled your horses, you enter the tavern to ask the price of a room. The taproom is surprisingly quiet.

<p>Soon you arrive at a part of the city that Banedon remembers well. It borders a large public garden called the Rainbow Park, so named because of the vast number of rare and colourful flowers that grow there. The park is now an encampment for those who have answered the President’s desperate call for defenders. Survivors from the towns of Resa and Zila have joined forces with green-clad Daroga woodsmen, tough hill-dwellers from the Chah mountain valley, and river-folk from the Churdas, forming regiments to reinforce the Tahou garrison. Their battle-stained banners, lit by the flickering glow of a hundred campfires, flutter above the tents that fill the great park.</p>
<p>Opposite the entrance stands the Guildhall of Tailors. You turn into an avenue running beside this imposing hall, and then cross into the North District by means of alleys and side streets, and finally emerge at Leech Street, just opposite the house of Chiban the Magician. His is a grand building of polished red stone set with small, diamond-paned windows that twinkle like cat’s eyes in the moonlight. You pass beneath its arched gateway and climb the magnificent tiled steps that lead to a black oak door. Banedon raps the knocker and you wait patiently for it to open.</p>
<p>Minutes later the great door swings aside and the aristocratic figure of Chiban stands framed in the doorway. Keen-eyed and grey-haired, he welcomes you both with surprise and delight.</p>
<p>‘Banedon!’ he exclaims, like a father reunited with a long lost son. ‘How good it is to see you. But what brings you to Tahou at this darkest of hours? Have you come to offer your skills in the defence of our beleaguered city?’</p>
<p>‘My services are yours to command, my lord Chiban,’ answers Banedon, bowing respectfully to his former mentor. ‘Yet also I return to your esteemed household to seek your help at the behest of King Ulnar of Sommerlund. May I introduce my companion—Lone Wolf.’</p>
<p>Chiban turns his kindly gaze on you and smiles knowingly. ‘I am honoured to meet you, Kai Lord,’ he says. ‘I have knowledge of that which you seek and I shall aid you all I can in your search for it.’</p>
<p>He beckons you to enter and the door closes behind you, seemingly of its own accord. You follow Chiban to his study. The musty room is lined with massive wooden racks full of books and papers. At its centre a large, circular table is completely covered with the implements of his magical researches. He clears a space amid the clutter and motions you to sit. ‘You must both be famished after your journey here. Come, eat and enjoy!’ For a few seconds, a shimmering pool of light fills the space, and then fades, leaving a sumptuous meal of grilled trout, baked potatoes, hakeroot, and sparkling Anarian wine.</p>
<p>If you have lost any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points on your adventure so far, you may now restore 3 points as you consume this delicious meal.</p>

<p>The room, which overlooks the courtyard and stables, is small yet surprisingly clean and comfortable. You sleep well, but you are rudely awoken at dawn by the <i>clang</i> of a brass hand-bell. Guyuk’s wife is walking around the courtyard ringing it for all she’s worth. ‘Daybreak, daybreak! All awake, all awake!’ she cries, her voice only slightly less piercing than her bell. Quickly you wash and dress before gathering together your equipment and heading for the stables. Banedon is already there, having risen before dawn to prepare the horses.</p>
<p>The sky is cloudless and the air is warm and still as you ride out of Chadi. Open grasslands stretch before you, broken occasionally by the low, whitewashed farm buildings and peasant dwellings. It is noon when you arrive at a mass of standing stones that line the highway approaches to the village of Phea. Banedon recalls a local legend that the Black Zakhan of Vassagonia once came to wage war on the defenceless inhabitants of Phea, who had no army. The besieged people offered up prayers to the Goddess Ishir, who was sufficiently moved by their plight to cause the wicked Vassagonians to become petrified right where they stood, clad in full armour and clasping their weapons. It strikes you that the Pheans may very soon have cause to pray for Ishir’s help a second time.</p>

<p>The flats comprise fields of cultivated crops that form a fertile market garden two miles wide. They are farmed right up to the banks of the great moat that encircles the capital.

On this side of the city the mist is less dense and you can see regiments of Drakkarim warriors advancing in lines towards the great moat. Behind them are trundled huge machines of war designed to fire canisters of boiling oil and red-hot liquid metal over the city wall. Cavalry wait in reserve while siege towers and catapults are hauled forward by lumbering ghorkas and muscular leathery zull.</p>

<p>With a bony fist she raps loudly on the door of the hut. Inside, a croaky voice bids you enter and she tugs at your sleeve impatiently, urging you into the foul-smelling hovel. Seated on a threadbare carpet, and surrounded by what appear to be heaps of chicken bones, is a scrawny old man dressed completely in feathers. He has a long, pointed nose and a stubbly grey beard which grows to just below his beady bloodshot eyes. The crone kneels and whispers in his ear before bowing and leaving the hut. As the door swings shut the shaman scoops up a handful of bones, closes his eyes, and, with a sound like a flock of startled gulls, casts them in the air. After a full minute of chanting and waving his hands, the old man opens his eyes and looks down on the bones which lie scattered on the beaten earth floor.</p>
<p>‘You have many enemies, Northlander,’ he says, his hook-like fingers tracing patterns around the bones, ‘powerful enemies. They plot to prevent you from walking your chosen path, for that path will lead to their destruction. There is one who will tell you that he is a friend. You must not trust this one. There is treachery in his heart.’</p>

<p>Crouching in the shadows beneath the staircase, you look to the end of a torchlit corridor, where a soldier stands guard at a pair of solid iron gates. ‘Your weapons and equipment are on the other side of that gate, my friend,’ whispers Sogh. ‘It’s the tower strongroom, although it’s not as strong as they’d like to think. They caught me inside once, but they never found out how I managed to get in. There’s a secret passage that leads through the wall to the stables outside. If we can get past that guard and into the strongroom, you can get your equipment back, I can get what I came here for, and we can both get out through the stables.’</p>
<p>‘But what about my friend?’ you reply, worried about Banedon’s safety.</p>
<p>‘He’s not here. I overheard the guards say they were taking him to the Eastgate Barracks. I’d worry about his neck after you’ve saved your own if I were you.’</p>
<p>You stare at the guard, a plan slowly forming in your mind. ‘Give me that purse of silver,’ you say, holding out your hand.</p>
<p>‘Now, wait a minute, I…’ replies Sogh, in a fluster.</p>
<p>‘Don’t argue,’ you retort. ‘You’ll get it back. I just need the right sort of bait to hook us this fish.’</p>
<p>Reluctantly he hands over the purse. Silently you leave the shadows and creep along the corridor, taking care to avoid the pools of flickering torchlight. When you are within ten feet of the guard, you begin to lay a trail of silver Lune all the way back to the staircase. The guard notices the glint of silver and cannot resist the temptation; he leaves his post to collect the coins. You wait tensely, sword in hand, as he approaches slowly. He is within a few feet of your hiding place when suddenly he sees you and begins to shout for help.</p>

<p>You walk along the narrow, cobblestoned street, taking care to avoid passing too close to windows and doorways, where the glare of firelight is brightest. The city is in a sullen mood. With their women and children safe in the south, the soldiers and citizens busy themselves with preparations for the battle that is imminent. Heavy steps and the clank of weapons echo along the street as a troop of Slovian mercenaries march by, with scarlet- and black-striped shields on their arms, and polished halberds resting on their mailed shoulders. You follow as they march towards a building in the distance, where their officer orders them to halt and fall out. Most of the soldiers then enter the building, but two remain outside to talk and share a pipe of Lourden tobacco. A sign fixed to the building says:</p>

They are joined by another, who has come to help with their task. He takes his place at the lip of the shaft and grips the rope, but hidden in his hand is a razor-sharp blade!

<p>Like most southern Anarian peasants, these farm hands are simple folk. They have heard nothing of the war in the north, and know nothing about the Darkland armies that are poised to assault their capital.

<p>Relentlessly the enemy pour their fire upon the north and west city walls, until the black sky above Tahou takes on a vivid scarlet glow. The defenders look to their weapons uneasily and pray that the gods are with them, at least until dawn. And when the first rays of dawn light show above the eastern hills, no mists enshroud the armies of Darklord Gnaag—they are massed in all their glory, awaiting the order to attack. You cast your eye across this sea of doom and mark the many regiments of evil that are ranged against the walls of Tahou.</p>
<p>The armoured legions of Vassagonia are the first to advance, moving in ordered columns towards the West Gate. At their head walks a figure sheathed in gold around whom a cold blue fire glows intensely. He strides within range of the city archers and they send a cloud of arrows to greet him, but these shatter and crackle when they encounter his impregnable glowing shield. He crosses the siege bridge and halts before the West Gate. In his hand is an orb of black metal. He holds it before him and mouths an incantation. Instantly a bolt of scarlet flame lances from the orb, destroying the great doors with a thunderous boom. Proudly he strides into the city and the defenders melt before him. One summons enough courage to attack him with a spear. There is a crackling flash and in an instant the soldier is transformed into a pile of glowing ash.</p>

<p>The great flagstoned precinct at the entrance to the Anarium is packed with hundreds of people. Senate officials, soldiers, and citizens crowd the steps that give access to the grand foyer and outer chambers of the hall. You notice that a side entrance is being used exclusively by army scouts who arrive with dispatches and leave with orders for the lookouts hidden in the surrounding hills. You take a calculated gamble and order the carriage driver to draw up at the side entrance.

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="680" width="386" src="ill17.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration XVII</strong>—President Toltuda occupies a seat in the centre of the hall and presides over a heated discussion.
<br /><br /></div><p>From your seat in the gallery you stare down at an oval hall, ringed by twelve arches beneath which the senators of Anari sit upon their throne-like chairs of lacquered oak. President Toltuda occupies a seat in the centre of the hall and presides over a heated discussion that is raging back and forth. Having heard all sides of the argument he calls for a vote, and the issue is decided by a show of hands.</p>
<p>‘We now come to a quite extraordinary matter, which has been raised by one of our most eminent citizens,’ says President Toltuda, introducing your appeal to the Senate. He turns to the gallery and calls out, ‘Sommlending Lord, Lone Wolf, please make yourself known to the assembly.’</p>
<p>You rise from your seat and bow to the senators. ‘Please present your request to us, Lone Wolf,’ says the President, and a hush descends on the hall as you explain the purpose of your journey to Tahou. When you have finished, the President calls upon the senators to speak.</p>
<p>‘I say we should help the Sommlending,’ pipes the shrill voice of Senator Zilaris. ‘If he finds the Lorestone, its power could turn the tide and save Tahou from the clutches of Darklord Gnaag.’ A murmur of agreement stirs in the hall.</p>
<p>‘And I say we should refuse to open the Cauldron,’ booms the powerful voice of Senator Chil. ‘I say that if it were not for his presence in our city, we would be spared the attention of the Darklords. He is the object of their anger and spite. I say we should give him to them, and in doing so we will save our city, our country, our people, and ourselves!’ A surge of support echoes from the arches, and your skin prickles at the thought of what could happen. President Toltuda calls for a vote to decide whether the Senate should allow you to enter the Cauldron, or use you to bargain for peace with the Darklords.</p>
<p>Tensely you await the result. The votes are cast and counted and the Senate is split evenly: six votes for you and six votes against. The decision now rests with the President himself. He must cast the deciding vote.</p>

Know you this, Sommlending: the Cauldron is but one way to enter the main shaft to Zaaryx. There are other routes, other shafts, and all of them are known to me. I will show you one such shaft, but you must do something in return. Is it agreed?’</p>
<p>Cautiously you ask his terms. ‘My son, Aiebek, entered the shaft three moons ago, drawn by the stories of dragon gold. He has not returned. All I ask is that if you find his body, you bring me the ring he wears upon his right hand.’ Without hesitation you agree to these terms, for they seem most reasonable. He smiles, but this time his eyes glow with a strange intensity, as if he were a man on the brink of madness. ‘Do not fail me,’ he says, softly, holding aloft the sparkling mind-gem. ‘I shall know if you lie.’</p>

Standing in the doorway are two burly guards, one clutching a bowl of food and the other holding a large iron key. ‘Hmm…I thought that lock opened a bit too easily,’ mumbles Sogh, as he backs away from the advancing guards. They drop what they are carrying and draw their swords; they are determined to prevent your escape.</p>

<p>It is a grim grey building, devoid of decoration or colour, its stark bare walls serving to remind the Tahouese of its sober purpose. It is a place where justice is meted out to wrongdoers and harsh punishments are imposed. All trials are conducted before a magistrate and his decision is final; there are no juries in Tahou. The Chief Magistrate presides over crimes that are serious enough to warrant the death penalty and, as you stare at the courthouse from the shadows of a doorway, your pulse quickens when you see his carriage draw up outside. An old man with long grey hair and a beard, he is wearing the purple and silver robes of the judiciary. He is accompanied by court guards and scribes, who help him to climb the steps to his private chambers located within the court building. When he reaches the top step he halts, turns, and points his finger at you.</p>

<p>At the very moment of his death, the shimmering web of energy that encases the Zakhan’s body flares with a scarlet brilliance so intense that you are forced to avert your eyes for fear of it blinding you. The light surges and fades, leaving behind a mound of glowing fragments that crumble and dissolve noisily until all that remains of the Zakhan and the Orb of Death is a dark stain on the earth where they fell.</p>

The Vassagonians who gained entry are either killed or forced back into the moat as the gate is quickly retaken. A cheer resounds from the city wall, a cheer that becomes a chant carrying word of Kimah’s demise to the enemy beyond the moat, and gradually the advancing legions slow to a halt as their hope of an easy victory dies. Officers ride to and fro, cursing and threatening their men with all manner of punishment, but their morale is severely shaken; the ranks of armoured warriors merely stand in shocked silence and refuse to advance. The sound of distant trumpets is heard and all eyes turn to the south to see wave upon wave of mounted warriors emerging from the hills around Varta. They pour from every valley and pass to fill the southern flats with regiments of horsemen resplendent in uniforms of blue, white, and grey.</p>
<p>‘Our prayers have been answered,’ says Chiban, as he and Banedon rejoin you at the city wall. ‘Behold, the allies of Anari have come to aid us in our darkest hour.’ He points to the advancing cavalry and you recognize, fluttering from their lances, the battle standards of three countries: Firalond, Lourden, and Kakush. Then the thunder of their horses’ hooves fills the air and a wave of joy surges through you as you witness their first charge devastate the enemy’s ranks, throwing them into chaos and confusion. A great battle ensues as the enemy slowly gather themselves to resist this unexpected assault. By noon two of their armies have been smashed and routed, and the third fights a desperate rearguard action as it covers the chaotic retreat westwards.</p>
<p>At last the fighting around the city comes to an end, and the defenders give voice to their elation that their home has been saved from the hordes of Darklord Gnaag. Senator Zilaris proclaims you ‘the saviour of Tahou’, and the victorious cheers of the citizens echo through the burning streets and across the flats that lie strewn with enemy dead. (If any of your Weapons or weapon-like Special Items were confiscated by the South Gate Guard, they are now gratefully returned to you.) You gaze at this grim panorama and your blood runs cold. But it is not the sight of the carnage that grips you with fear, it is your growing awareness of a powerful evil that is taking shape above the West Gate. A billowing black cloud forms in the sky, and from out of this cloud there comes a harsh and terrible voice.</p>
<p>‘I will be avenged,’ it booms, its resonance shaking the battlements on which you stand. You steel yourself, half expecting a bolt of lightning to leap from the cloud and hurtle towards you, but no such attack materializes. Instead, the chilling voice continues in a mocking tone. ‘Know this: you will pay for your defiance with your life. I, Gnaag of Mozgôar, have the three remaining Lorestones that you seek, and I shall destroy them when I destroy you, Kai Lord.’</p>
<p>A gust of wind catches the cloud and it clears swiftly, but it leaves behind a numbing dread that fills your heart, for you sense that the words were no idle threat—the terrible voice of Darklord Gnaag spoke the truth.</p>
<p>Your quest has succeeded, for the wisdom and strength of the Lorestone of Tahou is now a part of your body and spirit, and your defeat of Zakhan Kimah has turned the tide of war decisively against the Darkland armies. But the shocking news that the Darklords now possess the remaining Lorestones of Nyxator heralds the start of a new and deadly perilous episode of the Magnakai quest.</p>

<h2><a name="crsumary">Combat Rules Summary</a></h2>


<ol>
<li>Add your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to any extra points given to you by your Magnakai Disciplines.</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. This number = Combat Ratio.</li>
<li>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio on the top of the chart and cross-reference to the random number you have picked. (E indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Enemy. LW indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Lone Wolf.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from Stage 3 until one character is dead. This is when the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either character falls to 0 or below.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="smevazn">To Evade Combat</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>You may only do this when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>You undertake one round of combat in the usual way. All points lost by the enemy are ignored; only Lone Wolf loses the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>If the book offers the chance of taking evasive action in place of combat, it can be taken in the first round of combat or any subsequent round.</li>

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
<h3><a name="errstat">Note on Adjusted Combat Statistics</a></h3>

<p>Some enemies in this book have had their statistics altered in accordance with the Collector’s Edition to balance the game. Here is a table to show which enemies have been altered.</p>
