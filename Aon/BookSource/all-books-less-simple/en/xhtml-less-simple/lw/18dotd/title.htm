 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>You are Lone Wolf—Kai Grand Master of Sommerlund. During your long voyage home from a successful quest you discover the Dark God Naar is poised to unleash a horde of fire-breathing dragons upon the Kai Monastery. Will his agents assassinate you <i xml:lang="fr">en route</i>? Or will you manage to arrive at your monastery in time to take command of the New Order of young Kai warriors in what could be their first and final battle against Naar’s champions of evil?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf of Sommerlund, sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of the Kai—an élite warrior caste.</p>
<p>It is the year MS 5077, twenty-seven years since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain—the Darklands—and caused the destruction of their leader and the base of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>
<p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Some factions which were part of this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Skilfully their commanders exploited the chaos and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.</p>
<p>For seven years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a New Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well established. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time here at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>
<p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection—to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>
<p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and the training of the New Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded for, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>
<p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power which you had recovered during an earlier quest for Kai knowledge. In this vault, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors—Banedon and Rimoah—you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines, and grasp the fundamental secrets of Brotherhood and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
<p>In the years following your victory over the Darklords, peace has reigned victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the evil which once threatened to destroy them has been banished from the face of Magnamund. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of the Dark God Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>
<p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar’s agents and you have, on each occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. But your continuing victories against his minions have enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. One such minion, the powerful Deathlord of Ixia, threatened to enslave the free nations of Magnamund with a weapon forged by Naar himself. Bravely you ventured alone into the Deathlord’s icy domain and confronted him in a life-or-death battle in which you were triumphant. However, as you were returning from the Deathlord’s frigid realm you learned that Sommerlund had been attacked. In your absence, Naar had sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to destroy the New Order of the Kai and lay waste to your homeland.</p>
<p>The news came as a terrible shock. In Ixia you had won a great victory over Evil, yet at what cost? You had no doubts that the New Order were worthy Kai warriors, but they were all so young, their mettle as yet untested in the furnace-heat of battle. Secretly you feared that they would be unable to resist Naar’s newest champions, and so you resolved to return as quickly as possible to Sommerlund to take command of the Kai Monastery and orchestrate your country’s defences.</p>
<p>In the court of King Sarnac of Lencia, in the city of Vadera, you received a pledge from the King himself that he would do all in his power to help speed your long journey home to Sommerlund. Accompanied by Lord Ardan, a friend and magician from the land of Dessi, you were put aboard a Lencian clipper, one of the fastest of all sea-going vessels. This ship was bound for Garthen—the principal city of Talestria—which lies more than a thousand miles to the east of Vadera. This was to be the first stage of your journey back to Sommerlund, a destination more than two thousand miles from Lencia. As you set sail from Vadera harbour you knew that you were embarking upon a race against time, a desperate race in which the future of your country and the New Order of the Kai were at stake.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>For more than seven years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you begin this Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 31). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1–17), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to Book 18. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1–5) or <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6–12) adventures.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1–5) and <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6–12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13–onwards):</p>

<p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="54" width="386" src="wpnmast.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>This Discipline enables a Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat with one of your Grand Weaponmastery weapons, you add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Defender, with which you begin the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, means you are supremely efficient in the use of <em>two</em> of the weapons listed below. For each book that you complete in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13–20), you will gain mastery of an additional weapon. For example, if you complete <cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite> and have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery at the beginning of the next <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> book, you may choose an additional Weapon to gain mastery of.</p>

<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you set off on your long journey to Sommerlund you take with you a <a href="#map">map of Northern Magnamund</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1–17), you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. Fifty Crowns is the maximum you can carry, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your monastery.</p>
<p>You can take four items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess from previous adventures (remember, you are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry a maximum of ten Backpack Items).</p>

</ul>
<p>List the four items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the appropriate headings, and make a note of any effect they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is strongly recommended that you also equip yourself with a close combat weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given either initial capitals (e.g. Gold Dagger, Magic Pendant), or is clearly labelled as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of central Northern Magnamund is the Lune, but Gold Crowns are readily accepted at an exchange rate of four Lune for every one Gold Crown.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 27) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving him a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 35.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Doomwolf pack’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +5. (35−30 = +5). +5 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +5. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge).</li>
<li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may evade only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, you will gain an additional Grand Master Discipline and progress towards the pinnacle of Kai perfection—to become a Kai Supreme Master.</p>
<ol>
<li>Kai Grand Master Senior</li>
<li>Kai Grand Master Superior</li>
<li>Kai Grand Sentinel</li>
<li>Kai Grand Defender—<em>You begin the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> adventures at this level of Mastery</em></li>
<li>Kai Grand Guardian</li>
<li>Sun Knight</li>
<li>Sun Lord</li>
<li>Sun Thane</li>
<li>Grand Thane</li>
<li>Grand Crown</li>
<li>Sun Prince</li>
<li>Kai Supreme Master</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="imprvdsc">Improved Grand Master Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Kai Grand Mastery, you will find that your Disciplines will steadily improve. For example, if you possess the Discipline of Grand Nexus when you reach the Grand Master rank of Grand Thane, you will be able to pass freely through Shadow Gates and explore the nether realms of Aon and the Daziarn Plane.</p>
<h4><a name="guardian">Kai Grand Guardian</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian (5 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians with this Discipline are able to  summon a limited number of forest animals to their location. The creatures so summoned will become loyal and willing allies, willing to do the Kai Grand Guardian’s bidding. This ability can only be used in an outdoor setting.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this skill are able to create a cloud of fog-like vapour within 15 yards of their location. This fog will obscure both normal and infravision. The duration of the fog increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians with this skill enjoy increased mobility when travelling across all types of terrain, whether on foot or on horseback. This improved ability is very useful when used to outdistance a pursuing enemy.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to attack up to three enemies in psychic combat simultaneously.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this Discipline are able to exercise a defensive psychic skill known as Mindblend. This cloaking ability enables them to both protect and hide their minds from being detected by a hostile psychic probe.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Splinter</i>—This causes breakable items such as bottles, jugs, mirrors, windows, etc., to shatter to pieces. The range of this spell increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Flameshaft</i>—This causes the tip of any Arrow or Arrow-like missile, to burn fiercely with a magical flame which cannot readily be extinguished by normal means.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunkght">Sun Knight</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Knight (6 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights with this Discipline are able to wield two-handed weapons (i.e. Broadsword, Quarterstaff, and Spear) with full effect, using only one hand.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature’s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Knights with this skill are able to repel at will all normal-sized insects within a radius of three yards. The range and number of insects so affected increase considerably as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Halt Missile</i>—This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may  pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2–3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight sufficient time to move away from its line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by  this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Strength</i>—By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunlord">Sun Lord</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Lord (7 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast—a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a ‘0’ = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration and degree of surface difficulty increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Lord are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Penetrate</i>—This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
<li><i>Energy Grasp</i>—This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i>, but differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or an enemy to effect the spell.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunthane">Sun Thane</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Thane (8 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes with this Discipline are able to command an animal to fall asleep at will. Some hostile animals may be able to resist this command, but most will be affected by it in some way. The duration of effect and the number of animals which can be affected at one time will increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this skill are able to conduct a Kai Exorcism. This ritual will banish any evil supernatural force that has taken possession of any goodly creature or object.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Thanes with this skill are able to protect themselves from the effects of being struck by natural electrical discharges, i.e. lightning.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to alter the temperature of water by touch. By using this skill they are able to transform water into ice and vice versa. The volume of water affected, and  the duration of effect, both increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to erect a special psychic defence called <i>Mindfort</i>. A <i>Mindfort</i> defence greatly reduces the effects of any psychic shock that would normally paralyse or weaken a lesser mortal.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Thane are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Slow Fall</i>—By casting this spell, Kai Sun Thanes are able to slow their rate of free-falling to three feet per second, thereby avoiding damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. The duration of the spell is limited at first, but it steadily increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Breathe Water</i>—Using this spell, a Kai Sun Thane is able to breathe underwater for ten minutes. The duration of effect increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="grandthane">Grand Thane</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Kai Grand Master who has reached the rank of Grand Thane (9 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes with this Discipline are able to call upon the God Kai for divine assistance should a situation warrant it. Kai cannot intervene to save a Grand Thane from physical danger, but he can give signs which may help a Grand Thane choose the best course of action. A Grand Thane can call upon the God Kai for assistance no more than once every month. The frequency of divine audiences will increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes who possess this skill are able to protect themselves from detection by creatures using infravision (the ability to see the heat radiating from a person or thing), or ultravision (the ability to detect objects or movement in the ultraviolet spectrum of light).<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes with this skill are able to focus their mind-power upon inanimate breakable objects, e.g. bottles, windows, all ceramics, urns, jugs, etc., and cause them to explode violently. Any person or creature in close proximity to such an explosion risks injury from flying shrapnel.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes who possess mastery of this Discipline can pass freely through Shadow Gates. These phenomena are special portals which enable one to access other dimensions and planes of existence outside of Magnamund. Kai Grand Thanes are able to detect the location of Shadow Gates and pass through them without suffering any physical ill effects. The range of detection increases as a Kai Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to detect the exact location of precious gems, and valuable metals such as gold, platinum, and silver. These minerals and metals may occur naturally in the ground or they could be part of a hidden treasure hoard. The range of this ability is limited at first, but increases steadily as a Kai Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Grand Thane are able to use the following Old Kingdom Battle-spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Power Glyph</i>—By inscribing this ancient glyph (a secret magical symbol) upon a door, an archway, or even upon the lid of a closed box, a Kai Grand Thane is able to protect items or portals from being opened. Any creature attempting to open a portal protected in such a way will release the power of the glyph and suffer its deadly effects.</li>
<li><i>Hold Enemy</i>—Using this spell, Kai Grand Thanes are able to immobilize a single hostile creature anywhere within twenty feet of themselves. The duration of the spell is dependent upon the size and strength of the targeted creature. The range and duration of effect of this spell increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Grand Master Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Grand Master Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books.</p>
</div><div class="frontmatter">
<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Grand Master’s Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>In order to find the quickest route from Vadera to your Kai Monastery you may well have to pass through several wild and dangerous regions of Magnamund. Be wary and on your guard at all times, for the agents of the Dark God Naar are abroad and they will do everything in their power to thwart your safe return.</p>
<p>Some of the things that you will find or encounter during your mission will be of use to you in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>
<p>Pick your Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores may be. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Grand Master adventure.</p>
<p>May the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir make swift your return to your endangered homeland.</p>
<p>For Sommerlund and the Kai!</p>
</div><div class="numbered">
<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>You set sail from Vadera harbour on a bitterly cold, grey, late winter’s day. The masts of your host ship, the Lencian clipper <cite>Saxin</cite>, have been rigged with every available square inch of canvas to catch the prevailing winds that will, with luck, propel you quickly to Talestria—the first stage of your long journey home. The clipper is a sleek and impressive craft and its departure does not go unnoticed, yet of all the many Lencians who have turned out to watch and wave it farewell, only King Sarnac and his closest advisors know the true purpose of its voyage.</p>
<p>Once the <cite>Saxin</cite> is beyond the sheltering walls of Vadera harbour, its captain charts an easterly course along the Tentarias—the chain of seas and landlocked lakes which separate the two continents of Magnamund. You and your companion, Lord Ardan, settle into the ship’s easy routine and, with few on-board duties to perform, you endeavour to pass the long hours constructively. With the aid of a <a href="#map">map</a> which he gives to you, Ardan briefs you on the route you should travel if you are to reach Sommerlund as swiftly as possible. You spend your time discussing the details of the route and pondering the new Evil which now threatens your homeland and the Kai.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small7.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Every night, as you lie awake on your bunk staring at the tarred beams of your cabin, you wish away the miles that separate you from your beloved homeland. You want, most of all, to be with your young Kai acolytes in this dark hour, but fate has seen fit to place a great distance between you. Fearful of what you may find if you arrive home too late, every night you offer up prayers to the Gods Ishir and Kai to help speed your return to Sommerlund.</p>

<p>You are deeply suspicious of the youth, and by using the Brotherhood Spell <i>Sense Evil</i>, you soon confirm your fears. You detect that he is a murderous cut-throat and that his sinister building is home to Varetta’s notorious Guild of Thieves. Forewarned of the danger, you wheel your horse about and gallop away along Spur Lane, retracing your route back to the square at the city’s South Gate. On returning here, you rein in your horse and pause to consider the remaining two exits from the square.</p>

<p>It is early in the afternoon when you catch sight of a grand, half-timbered bridge in the far distance. It spans a river, swollen by the recent rains, which you recognize at once to be the River Reloni. There is a small circular tent near the approach to the bridge, and three Eldenoran soldiers are seated on stools beside it, each smoking a long-stemmed pipe.</p>
<p>At first you consider avoiding the bridge and finding somewhere else to make a crossing, but the river is wide and fast-flowing, and the three guards look particularly weak and stupid. After some deliberation, you decide to try to bluff your way past them.</p>
<p>As you approach, one of the guards gets up off his stool and moves to stand in your way. Casually, he asks to see some sort of identification.</p>

<p>You shout the order to fire and the Kai let loose their straining bowstrings. A cloud of arrows with armour-piercing tips, hardened in the fires of the monastery forge, whistles towards the swooping Lavas with impressive accuracy. All find their target, but only one of the winged creatures falls from the sky. You see that the beast has been struck in the eye. Hurriedly the acolytes reload as the Lavas prepare to land on the Tower of the Sun.</p>
<p>‘Fire at their eyes!’ you shout, and a cloud of Kai arrows is sent screaming through the sky to seek their elusive mark. This time more than half find their target, decimating the onrushing Lavas at a single stroke, yet those winged creatures who do survive this deadly volley are quickly among the defenders on the tower.</p>

The King places under your command his élite Guard Cavalry regiment, so that you may be able to use them to break through the enemy’s line at its weakest point and reach the Kai Monastery.

<p>It is near dusk when you emerge from the hills and see the glimmering waters of the River Kinam less than five miles distant. This great river marks the border between Talestria and Palmyrion, Queen Evaine’s neighbouring ally. The road descends to a border toll bridge beyond which you can see the sprawling town of Scade. The troop is challenged by the bridge warden to halt and pay a fee of 100 Silver Lune. This fee is soon forgotten, though, when the Lord Constable shows the pedantic old man his Royal Seal. With a stiff salute he steps aside and bids you all a safe journey.</p>
<p>Scade is a bustling market town which has grown rich and fat in the years following the defeat of the Darklords. Its brightly painted buildings and paved thoroughfares exude affluence, and even its lowly street-beggars look clean and well-fed by comparison to those in other parts of Magnamund. Nathor leads the troop to an inn near the centre of the town, a fine establishment called ‘The Lucky Bucket’. Its owner, a corpulent fellow with a polished bald pate, welcomes him with open arms. After the ordeal at Pinepeaks and the long day’s ride, you are looking forward to a hot bath and a large supper. However, it soon transpires that the inn is almost full and the owner can only provide rooms for five of the troop.</p>
<p>‘Not to worry,’ says Nathor, noticing the look of disappointment on your face. ‘I know Knight Tranius—the lord of this manor. Many’s the time we’ve hunted boar in the hills. His castle is but two miles from here. Five can billet here tonight while the rest of us lodge with Tranius.’</p>
<p>You agree to Nathor’s proposal and set off with him, accompanied by three of the troopers, along a river track which heads north to Castle Tranius.</p>

<p>Overhead the sun gleams like a jewel in the clear blue sky, and the early morning air bites with a refreshing sharpness which helps to revive your spirits. A layer of thick frost covers the stony trail from the monastery, and it scrunches loudly under the horses’ hooves as you make your careful descent. Soon you rejoin the east road and follow it, through a series of shallow gorges, to a thick pine forest where the ground is covered with mossy rocks. Here the road ascends to a crest where a pall of black smoke stains the cloudless sky. As you approach the crest, you suddenly sense danger ahead and shout a warning to Nathor. He commands the troop to halt while you go ahead to assess the situation.</p>
<p>Beyond the crest you see a broad valley with steeply wooded sides. At its centre there is a village and a large stone building which, when you magnify your vision, you determine to be a church. The roof of this building is ablaze and several bodies lie dotted around its cultivated grounds and gardens. You signal to Nathor to join you and, when he arrives upon the crest, he is able to identify the burning church.</p>
<p>‘That’s Pinepeaks Abbey,’ he says, his voice stilted with anxiety. ‘They are in trouble—we must help them.’</p>
<p>He calls his men to come forward and, before you can caution him, he leads them at the gallop down the steep trail which descends towards the valley floor. Cursing his impetuosity, you spur your steed onward and follow in his wake. You have covered less than half a mile when suddenly your Magnakai sense of Divination screams a warning—the troop is riding directly into an ambush.</p>

Immediately you recognize the kindly face of Gwynian the Sage.</p>
<p>‘Fate calls us together once more, Lone Wolf,’ he says. ‘Come, we have much to discuss.’</p>
<p>And with that he takes hold of your horse’s bridle and leads him across the park to a grand building. It has changed much since you were last here, but despite the new brick and marble façade you recognize Varetta’s Halls of Learning.</p>
<p>You are taken along a gravelled path to a hall, where a sign hanging over its richly-carved oak door says ‘Library’. You dismount, and Gwynian ties the reins to a ring set into the wall. Then he pushes open the door and together you enter the library’s cool interior. Countless thousands of books and parchments crowd the stone shelves of this magnificent library, marching past on either side as you walk towards another door at the far end of the hall.</p>

Then a second portcullis descends, preventing you from returning into the castle keep. You are caught, trapped like fish in a barrel in the narrow corridor between these two gates.</p>
<p>This area is called the ‘murder hole’, and, as you soon discover to your cost, it is an apt description of what can occur in this dreadful place.

<p>You continue along the avenue until you reach the city’s north wall. Here you stop to read a proclamation that has been nailed to the door of a coaching inn and stables. It states that a curfew is in force in Rhem, and anyone found on the streets an hour after nightfall will be arrested by the city watch.</p>
<p>You are about to leave when you overhear the owner of the stables talking to one of his stable-hands. The boy is holding the reins of an aged horse that is severely lame in one leg, and the owner is telling him that he can no longer afford to stable the sick old mare.</p>
<p>‘She’ll have to go,’ says the owner, shaking his head. ‘She’s worthless to me now she’s not earning her keep.’</p>
<p>Tears are streaming down the young boy’s face. Clearly he loves the old horse and is heartbroken at the prospect of her being destroyed. Boldly you approach the owner and propose a deal.</p>
<p>‘Sir, if I am able to cure this lame mare,’ you say, stroking the horse’s velvety nose, ‘then will you allow me to keep her?’</p>
<p>‘Ha, ha, ha, so you think you can work miracles, do you?’ chuckles the owner. ‘Very well then, stranger. If you can cure her—you can keep her.’</p>
<p>Gently you settle the mare and run your hands down her lame foreleg. Using your Magnakai Disciplines of Curing and Animal Control, you slowly ease her worn-out joints and mend her cracked bones. Within minutes she is as agile as a newborn foal.</p>
<p>‘Well I be a storgh’s uncle!’ gasps the owner, amazed by the sudden transformation. ‘So, stranger, you <em>can</em> work miracles after all! The horse is yours!’</p>
<p>You climb upon the mare’s back and wave farewell to the owner and the stable-boy, who is now crying tears of joy.</p>
<p>‘If ever you’re looking for work,’ says the owner, as you turn the horse to leave, ‘then there’ll always be a job for you here!’</p>

<p>King Ulnar convenes an emergency council of the Sommlending barons in his Chamber of State. When all are assembled, Baron Caldar of Anskaven conducts a briefing, principally for your benefit, outlining the grave situation confronting Sommerlund and, most especially, the New Order of the Kai. You are aware of much of what he says, having been briefed already by Gwynian the Sage in Varetta, but you learn that the Sommlending army has lost many brave men attempting to break the siege at the Kai Monastery and is too weakened, at present, to attack the enemy again.</p>
<p>‘Where is Guildmaster Banedon?’ you ask, when called upon by the King to speak to the council of war.</p>
<p>‘He is at the Kai Monastery,’ answers Baron Medar of Tyso. ‘He, in company with Lord Rimoah of Dessi and the ten most senior magicians of Toran’s Brotherhood, went to the monastery during the early days of the siege. They travelled there aboard the Guildmaster’s skyship and…’ At this point, the Baron hesitates and looks to the King, as if seeking his permission to continue. The King continues on his behalf.</p>
<p>‘Grand Master,’ he says, his voice heavy, ‘the Guildmaster’s skyship was seen falling from the skies above the monastery. Border Rangers saw it crash in flames. We…we fear that all aboard were lost.’</p>
<p>The King’s words come as a terrible blow for Banedon and Rimoah are your closest friends. If it is true, and all of Sommerlund’s finest magicians have been lost at a stroke, then the blow is doubly severe. The security of your homeland will have been greatly compromised by their deaths.</p>

The move takes the leading pair of riders by surprise and, before they fully recover their battle-senses, you speed between them and lash out with a single scything sweep. Both riders crash to the ground—minus their heads.</p>
<p>Shocked by your sheer audacity, the brigand leader shouts a recall to the others. They wheel around in a wide arc and form up in a line behind him, cursing you vehemently for the death of their comrades. Then, with a vengeful yell, the brigand chief leads his gang of saddle-bandits in a charge that, he hopes, will leave you trampled into the ground.</p>
<p>As this wave of brigands comes thundering down upon you, the leader lunges at your head with his straight-bladed sword. It whistles by just inches from your scalp, but you do not allow him a second try. You twist in the saddle and strike like lightning, splitting his helmet and his skull with a single mighty blow. He falls before his men, yet they prove to be hardy rogues and they press home their attack regardless.</p>

<p>With dread, you cast your eyes across a nightmare landscape that stretches in every direction to a horizon dancing with fire. Streams of blazing lava cut fissures through the coal-black soil, and pools of molten mud, glowing cherry-red, spout geysers of yellow flame that seem to claw vengefully at the orange sky. The heat, and the stench of sulphur, is overwhelming.</p>
<p>The Lavas drops you onto the shifting black soil and soars upwards until it disappears into the roiling clouds. In the middle distance you see a herd of dragon-like creatures, snorting fire as they lumber slowly across this hellish plain. You sense great danger, and when you focus your Kai skills at the approaching leviathans, you are shocked by what you learn.</p>
<p>You have been transported to the Plane of Darkness, the domain occupied and ruled over by Naar, the Dark God. The approaching dragon-creatures are massing to enter the Shadow Gate that lies several hundred yards at your back.

You scan the surrounding landscape and note several small tracks (which lead to tiny farmsteads dotted around the vast plain) converging at a hamlet which nestles in a bend of this great river. During the past hour your horse has developed a slight limp, and a cursory look at his affected leg reveals that he has thrown a shoe. You know that unless you replace the missing shoe, and soon, he will be too lame to carry you further. Reluctantly, you decide to enter the hamlet and go in search of a blacksmith.</p>
<p>A signpost at the entrance to the hamlet announces its name: Kalma. It is a quiet, sleepy sort of place that in many ways reminds you of Dage, the Sommlending village where you were born and where you spent your early years. Near the centre of this humble village you discover a smithy where, even at this early hour, you can hear the sound of a hammer beating iron. You tether your horse to a rail alongside a moth-eaten old donkey, and call out for the blacksmith.</p>

You feel compelled to stop here and, without quite knowing why, you dismount from your horse and tie his reins to a ring which is set into the wall. Then you push open the door and enter the library’s cool interior.</p>
<p>Countless thousands of books and parchments crowd the stone shelves of this magnificent library. Your eyes travel along them until they reach another door at the far end of the hall. There, standing framed in its archway, is an old man clad in plain brown robes. He looks at you and smiles knowingly.</p>

<p>After the dangers of Eldenora, the plains of peaceful Slovia seem like a tranquil paradise. The grasslands are rich and fertile, and an abundance of game keeps you well fed during the five days it takes you to ride north to the walled city of Tekaro. Here, at an inn close by the city’s cathedral, where, years ago, you discovered one of the Lorestones of Nyxator during your quest for Kai knowledge, you spend a fortunate evening in the company of a band of Salonese mercenaries. Aided by your Kai skills, you fleece them of 30 Gold Crowns while playing cards, and with your gain you purchase a fresh horse for your continuing journey home. (Your new horse and a night’s lodging at the inn cost you 25 Gold Crowns; you may add the balance of 5 Gold Crowns to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, maximum allowances permitting.)</p>
<p>Early the following day you leave Tekaro and set out on the highway bound for Tido. You plan to reach Casiorn by means of the North Pass through the Slovarian Range, but during your second day on the road you are forced to revise your plans drastically. During a chance meeting at a wayside inn with a merchant who has journeyed from Casiorn, you learn that an avalanche has blocked the North Pass and travel by that route is now impossible. It will be several months before the pass is cleared and the mountain road rebuilt. You resolve instead to reach Casiorn by way of Varetta, the ancient city of crossed swords, and the following day you resume your ride north.</p>
<p>During your ride, you stop to assist a farmer whose cart has shed a wheel. In return for your help, he offers the services of his brother who operates a raft ferry across the River Quarl. Gladly the brother transports you and your horse across the river to Salony, where you enter the Great Forest by way of a timberland trail. After a full day’s ride along this lonely track, you find yourself approaching the outskirts of a town called Ellio.</p>

<p>As the sun rises above the waters of the Holmgulf, it sheds its golden light upon the hopeful citizens of Holmgard who have gathered to cheer your departure. You ride out of the King’s Citadel at the head of the Guard Cavalry regiment, with Captain D’Val at your side. Bouquets of Sommlending roses are thrown before the hooves of your warhorse, and your ears ring to the jubilant cries of the crowd as you, and the brave horsemen at your back, ride with pride through the city streets that lead to Holmgard’s north gate.</p>
<p>Once outside the city, you order your troop to couch their lances and form up in column, four abreast, in readiness for a swift ride north. At midday, you cross the River Unoram and meet with a patrol of Border Rangers who are guarding a junction. A track emerges from the Fryelund Forest and joins with the main road from the west at this point. Although it is unsigned, you recognize its rutted surface at once: it is the Alema Trail, one of several forest tracks which lead to the Kai Monastery, thirty miles distant. Captain D’Val tells you that the enemy line is weakest at a place several miles along this trail.</p>
<p>The Border Rangers come quickly to attention when they see you approaching. Their leader, a sergeant with a battle-wounded leg, warns you that the enemy were seen earlier flying over this area of the forest. You acknowledge his salute, and then you give the order for the regiment to form up in column, two abreast, before leading them along the trail and into the Fryelund Forest.</p>
<p>You have covered less than a mile of this woodland track when you find yourself descending a gentle slope towards a stream, a tributary of the Unoram. There once was a bridge which crossed the watercourse at this point, but it has long since collapsed. Its ancient stones now form a ford which carries the trail over to the far side of the stream.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man’s mind shield crumbles. He shrieks with fear and his body is racked by uncontrollable tremors. You command the prisoner to reveal the identity of the person who sent him here to Garthen to murder you, and a mass of images begins to swirl and solidify in your mind’s eye. They are the images of a past meeting in a far-off place which you recognize to be Duadon, the capital city of Eldenora. You see a shadowy figure, sheathed in ornate chainmail, handing a bulging pouch of gold to the prisoner in a dimly lit alleyway. The figure speaks your name before melting away into the shadows.</p>
<p>‘Who is this person?’ you say, commanding the trembling prisoner to answer. He parts his bruised lips and tries to utter a name but no sound emerges. You sense that he is fighting to overcome the remnants of the shielding spell placed upon his mind. Moving closer, you try to make out the name he is struggling hard to whisper.</p>

Its incessant cawing and the crash of its leathery wings against the upper branches bring Dorst and his men hurrying to investigate. They each pause to grab a bow and quiver from their saddlebags, and then they loose off a volley of arrows at the beast. Shrieking with frustration, the Kraan takes to the night sky and quickly disappears, heading away to the north.</p>

You can hear an old man’s voice trailing from its open doors, answered by the occasional murmur of a crowd. Inside you discover a wizened old cleric administering to a sick woman whose head is swathed with bandages. The cleric is attempting to cure the woman of her ills by laying on his hands, but the pressure is simply making the pain in her head feel worse.</p>
<p>‘Charlatan,’ mumbles one onlooker. ‘Old fake,’ whispers another. The aged cleric hears these dissenting voices and he becomes flustered. Although he may be incompetent as a healer, you sense that he is a good man at heart and so you decide to save him from the disgruntled crowd, who look as if they are on the brink of throwing him in the river at any moment.</p>

<p>‘It is good to see you again, Grand Master,’ he says, forcing a smile. ‘I was expecting you. I received word yesterday from Queen Evaine telling me of your urgent journey. Yet it is unfortunate that your visit should come at this time; I would have hoped to have given you the kind of welcome you truly deserve.’ The Elector then introduces you to his generals who acknowledge you with soldierly salutes.</p>
<p>‘As you can see, we are at war, Grand Master,’ he says, sweeping a hand over the maps which lie strewn across his state table. ‘The new ruler of Eldenora, a low-born blackguard by the name of Lutha who dares to adorn himself with the title “Prince of Duadon”, is attempting to seize our northern territories. We are locked in battle with his army of cut-throats near Holona and, though it pains me to have to admit this, we’re hard-pressed to contain his advance. This war has come without warning and we were ill-prepared. We have few reserves, insufficient to support the Holona garrison and to counter the many small units of Eldenoran horsemen who are ravaging our plains. This is a dark and testing time for us, Grand Master, but e’en so, I shall aid you all I can.’</p>

Cordas is reputedly the richest man in all of Magnamund. Manatine tells you that Cordas has ordered the construction of a sky-vessel to transport you swiftly to Sommerlund.</p>
<p>‘This craft is presently being built in Casiorn, and the High-Mayor has sent word that you should go there as quickly as you can. His teams of skilled artisans are working on the craft day and night, and he is confident that it will be completed in fifteen days’ time.’</p>
<p>In times of peace, you would expect the 850-mile ride to Casiorn to take little more than two weeks to complete. But peace, always a fragile state in the Stornlands, has been shattered by Prince Lutha’s unprovoked attack on Holona, a town through which you had hoped to travel. Anxiously, you ask the Elector how the war against Eldenora will affect your chances of reaching Casiorn swiftly.</p>

Choking and retching, they collapse to the floor, their fingers scrabbling at their swelling throats as they fight desperately for breath. You grab hold of their tunics, one in each hand, and drag their bodies out of the cell into the cleaner air of the corridor beyond.

They pronounce you dead; then there follows the tinny sound of metal scraping on metal before you feel yourself being lifted by the shoulders and feet and lowered into a slippery chute. A wave of panic makes you awake from your death-like trance with a start. This sudden and unexpected resurrection makes the guards scream and drop you. They scurry away, gibbering like idiots, and you are left to slide headlong down a chute which leads to a fast-flowing underground river.

You fall amidst a torrent of frothing water and hit the surface of a river twenty feet below.</p>

The current pushes you towards the river bank where a group of beggars, clad in mouldering rags, are sifting through the flotsam that is being flushed out of the city. You note with disgust that this floating debris consists mainly of corpses, many the victims of Prince Lutha’s brutal regime. The beggars take fright and scatter when you stagger out of the water. You watch them run away; then you hurry towards the beckoning safety of a wood which borders upon a rutted river road. Here you spend a damp, uncomfortable night trying to formulate a new plan of action that will enable you to reach Casiorn as quickly as possible. At length you resolve to go east and attempt to cross the River Storn to the Salonese city of Rhem, located on its east bank.

<p>As you are leaving the ford and ascending the slope of the river bank, suddenly there is a tremendous explosion. Unwittingly, you have ridden your horse through an invisible beam, a beam which has triggered a device hidden earlier among the rocks by Naar’s minions. The explosion sends sharp splinters of rock tearing into horses and men with deadly effect. The blast knocks you from your saddle and, as you fall backwards into the cold water, a splinter of rock slices through your left arm and another tears open your upper left thigh: lose 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

Captain D’Val has lost his horse, but miraculously he has survived with no more than scratches to his face and legs. Quickly you attend to the wounded, using your healing skills to ease their suffering. D’Val, wary of the vulnerability of his regiment, orders his men to abandon the dead and cross the ford as quickly as they can.</p>

<p>Ten days after leaving Vadera, the <cite>Saxin</cite> drops anchor in Varnos Harbour in Garthen—the crown capital of Talestria. The sleek and elegant lines of the Lencian craft contrast starkly with the drab, functional hulls of the merchant ships and dhows which crowd this city-port’s jetties and wharves. Lencian craft are a rare sight in Garthen, and the <cite>Saxin</cite> is the rarest of Lencian craft; it is no wonder that its arrival stirs a frenzy of interest and speculation among the citizens of this capital.</p>
<p>Word of your arrival travels quickly to the Royal Citadel and a troop of Queen Evaine’s Court Cavalry are dispatched to the harbour. They are led by a stern-faced man who wears the uniform and gold insignia of the Lord Constable, the highest military rank in the Talestrian army. He brings his column of regal horsemen to a halt at the quayside; then he dismounts and strides forward to welcome you in person as you disembark from the ship.</p>

<p>For two days you follow this trail through the great Forest of Salony. During your ride it strikes you that the weather seems to be reflecting the nature of the people who dwell in this region—cold and inhospitable. They do not take kindly to strangers, especially those riding alone.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, you reach a small village called Hopforst which stands at the edge of the Great Forest. To the west of the village you can now see the snow-capped mountain peaks of the Ceners, and to the north stretches an open expanse of rough grassland dotted with thickets of larch and pine.</p>
<p>As dusk is drawing its curtain of shadow over the land, you see in the distance the decaying walls of a derelict city. A broken sign by the roadside says that this place is called Amory, yet the newish track which branches off the road and avoids the city gate tells you that travellers on this road no longer visit here. It has begun to rain again and you are quietly dreading having to spend another night out in the open. Tempted by the promise of shelter, you approach Amory and enter the city by a gate that hangs haphazardly from its hinges.</p>

<p>Stoically you swim against the powerful current and reach the distant shore, breathless and exhausted, but glad to have escaped in one piece from the hostile land of Eldenora.</p>
<p>Once you have fully recovered, you put on your boots and cloak and take stock of your surroundings. You have emerged from the Storn at a wooded stretch of river bank, less than a mile south of the city of Rhem. You set off along a track heading north and within a few minutes, you catch sight of the city’s walls and its famous horseshoe-shaped harbour.</p>
<p>You enter the city by its south gate, using your Kai camouflage skills and your natural stealth to avoid the attentions of the watchful guards. Once inside, you merge with the crowds and soon find yourself in a square that is overshadowed by the twin towers of Rhem Cathedral. An avenue runs along the cathedral’s south side and, at its far end, your eye is drawn to a rusty suit of armour which stands beside the door to a dingy-looking shop.</p>

The fire-hardened tip penetrates its eye and, with a hideous shriek, it spins end over end before crashing into the parapet of the tower.</p>
<p>‘Fire at their eyes!’ you shout, and a cloud of Kai arrows is sent screaming through the sky to seek their elusive mark. More than half find their target, decimating the first wave of the Lavas attack at a single stroke, yet those winged creatures who do survive this deadly volley are quickly among the defenders on the tower. Suddenly you are confronted by one of these beasts who attempts to bat you over the parapet with its horny tail. You leap to avoid its scything attack, draw your weapon in mid-air, and strike your first blow the moment your feet return to the tower’s flagstones.</p>

<p>With Sabre Fox at your side, you climb the circular stairs to the Grand Hall of the Tower of the Sun. Excitedly the young Kai Master announces your arrival to the battle-weary Kai who are gathered here, and, at first, they look at you in stunned disbelief. Then the truth of what they see sinks in and they give vent to a loud cheer that can be heard all throughout the monastery.</p>
<p>The news of your return spreads like wildfire. Two of the first to welcome you back are your friend Guildmaster Banedon, and your trusted advisor Lord Rimoah.</p>
<p>‘Thank Ishir you are alive, Banedon,’ you say clasping his hand in friendship. ‘In Holmgard they fear that you and Rimoah were killed aboard your skyship. It gladdens my heart to see this is not so.’</p>
<p>‘And it warms me to see you safely home, Grand Master,’ he replies.</p>
<p>‘Though we’ve been hard-pressed to keep your home safe in your absence,’ adds Lord Rimoah, with a wry smile.</p>
<p>‘You both have my deepest thanks,’ you reply. ‘You took a great risk in coming to the aid of the Kai. I have seen what became of your skyship, Banedon. You were indeed fortunate to have survived.’</p>
<p>‘Aye,’ he replies, sadly. ‘Yet, alas, three of my Brotherhood were not so blessed. They perished when the Lavas dragged us from the skies.’</p>
<p>‘Take heart, Banedon, for their deaths will not be in vain. They shall be avenged.’ And with these prophetic words you take the Sun-crystal from your pocket and show it to your grieving friend. ‘With this crystal I shall destroy the Shadow Gate and put an end to Naar’s evil plan.’</p>
<p>Together with Banedon and Rimoah, you make a tour of the monastery to assess for yourself the extent of the battle damage. Your presence among the young Kai greatly improves their morale and strengthens their resolve to withstand the Lavas’ siege. You visit every area of the monastery, including the Lore Hall of Solaris where the bodies of those slain in battle have been laid out, awaiting burial. It saddens you to see so many Kai dead and, as you walk among their still ranks, you recognize many in whom you had held high hopes: Spring Rain, Eastwind, Sharp Dove, Deep Heart, Frost Lark, and Firefly. As you turn to leave the Lore Hall, you vow to Banedon and Rimoah that the sacrifice they have made will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>You ride to an overturned wagon that lies within thirty yards of the river’s edge. To the wide-eyed astonishment of the three soldiers who are sheltering here from a hail of naphtha and crossbow bolts, you leap from your horse and sprint headlong towards the river. The moment you hit the freezing water, you stay submerged and swim to the opposite bank. Once there, you make use of the corpses that litter the shoreline to conceal your presence while you observe the enemy trenches.</p>

<p>Your first reaction is to back away from this strange old man and reach for the hilt of your weapon, but then your Kai senses tell you that he means you no harm. You focus your psychic powers at his mind and, in an instant, you sense that he has summoned you here to aid you.</p>
<p>‘I am Gwynian the Sage,’ he says, meekly. ‘I am a humble servant of the Gods Kai and Ishir. I seek to help you, Grand Master. Will you not listen to my wisdom?’</p>
<p>You nod in wary agreement and allow the old man to usher you through the archway into an adjoining chamber. Here you see strange floating bulbs of light that illuminate a stone table covered with charts and scrolls.</p>
<p>‘Very well, Gwynian, what news have you of Sommerlund?’ you ask, sceptically.</p>
<p>‘Grave news,’ replies the old man, with an ominous tone. He picks up a chart from the table and traces a finger across the intricate lines and calculations that embellish its ancient yellowed surface.</p>
<p>‘The Dark God Naar has opened a Shadow Gate in the Durncrag Mountains, a corridor between our world and his. By means of this corridor he has sent a host of winged creatures—the Lavas—to assail your monastery. It is his plan to destroy the young order of Kai warriors while you are not able to lead them. The Shadow Gate opened at the time of the last full moon and, since then, the Kai Monastery has been attacked many times. Naar’s servants have your stronghold encircled and cut off from the armies of King Ulnar, who has repeatedly sought to break the siege. Your Kai have withstood the attacks well, Lone Wolf, but they are weakening. Only you can save them now.’</p>
<p>‘But how?’ you ask, shaken by Gwynian’s account of the events which have occurred during your absence from the monastery. ‘If the armies of King Ulnar are powerless to break the siege, how can I hope to save my brethren?’</p>
<p>‘Do not despair, Lone Wolf,’ replies Gwynian, reassuringly. ‘All is not yet lost. You can save your brave order by closing the gate through which Naar sends his Lavas minions.’</p>
<p>You are about to ask how you could possibly achieve this, how you could close the Shadow Gate, but your urgent question is forestalled when Gwynian raises his hand.</p>
<p>‘Patience for just a moment, Lone Wolf,’ he says, and he allows himself a smile. ‘I, humble Gwynian, possess the means by which you can thwart the Dark God’s murderous plan.’</p>

You order the men to lower their lances and then, with a smile of grim determination on your lips, you spur your horse forward and give voice to your battle-cry: ‘For Sommerlund and the Kai!’</p>
<p>The King’s Cavalry sweep down the meadow and engulf the winged horrors, driving their lances through their steely hides. You see two of the creatures disappear beneath a thundering wave of hooves, and another two are caught from behind as they attempt to take to the air. You strike one creature a blow to its head as you gallop across the stream. It glances off its iron-hard skull, but the force is sufficient to stun the beast. As it staggers drunkenly in your wake, Captain D’Val, who is leading the second line, veers towards it and runs it through with his lance.</p>
<p>Once you are over the stream, you spur your horse up the grassy rise towards the top of the ridge, now no more than a hundred yards distant. You are within seconds of reaching the crest of the ridge when suddenly one of the creatures comes swooping out of the sky. It fixes you with its glowing eyes and extends its talons as it comes screaming down towards your face.</p>

<p>Intrigued by the young woman’s high-bred charms, you step away from the bushes and approach her carriage door.</p>
<p>‘Why, yes,’ she says, excitedly. ‘You are the Northland warrior they call Lone Wolf, are you not? I was in attendance at the Elector’s court the day he awarded you the Star of Palmyrion for your victory over the Cener Druids of Ruel. I am honoured to meet with you in person, brave sir.’</p>

<p>You are woken from a fitful slumber by the sound of shouting. Cautiously you part the foliage to see a group of Duadon guardsmen scouring the river bank in search of your body. A brutish garrison sergeant is questioning a scrawny beggar whom he holds by the neck, lifting him several inches off the ground. The beggar, shaking with fear, points a finger towards the wood. The sergeant gives him a sneering smile, and then rewards him for his cooperation with a dagger in the guts.</p>
<p>‘Search the copse!’ bellows the sergeant, wiping the blood from his blade on the dead beggar’s coat. ‘Damned Northlander’s gone to ground in there.’</p>
<p>Quickly you retreat deeper into the wood as a line of soldiers comes crashing through the foliage, hacking and slashing with their broad-bladed swords. Using your camouflage skills, you slip through their line and make your way back towards the river road, to the place where they have left their horses. A blow to the base of the skull puts paid to the soldier who is standing guard there and, as quietly as you can, you take a horse and escape towards the east.</p>
<p>When you can no longer see the walls of Duadon, you rein in your horse and take stock of the equipment contained in its saddle-bags. You discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backpack</li>
<li>Rope</li>

<p>Determinedly you continue your ride east and, by mid-afternoon, you come to the banks of the mighty River Storn. From the cover of a derelict barn you observe a group of merchants and travellers who are waiting at a ferry post for the boat to Rhem. The post is controlled by Eldenoran soldiers who check the ferry passengers thoroughly to make sure they are not enemy agents or deserters from the army. After an hour or so, you see the boat from Rhem approaching the post. The waiting crowd gather their belongings and get ready to board what will be the last crossing of the day.</p>

<p>Your Kai Mastery alerts you to a beam of ultraviolet light at the exit from the ford. This pencil-thin beam emanates from behind the age-worn keystone of the old bridge, crosses the exit just inches off the ground, and disappears into some bushes opposite.</p>
<p>‘Column halt!’ you shout, bringing the regiment to a stop at the approach to the ford.</p>
<p>‘Is something wrong, Grand Master?’ asks D’Val, anxiously.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps,’ you reply, staring at the beam which is invisible to the captain’s eyes. ‘Wait here, captain, while I satisfy my curiosity.’</p>
<p>You urge your horse forward and approach the fallen keystone. As you draw closer, you sense that it conceals an explosive device constructed from materials not of this world. It is an elaborate booby trap planted here by Naar’s minions, and it is set to detonate should any large creature unwittingly break the beam.</p>

<p>As the ghastly spectre comes galloping towards you on its hellish black steed, your Kai senses warn you that it is the spirit of the evil lord who once ruled this city. His name was Roark and he was once a secret practitioner of the dark arts of the Cener Druids. He has long since perished in the flesh but his evil spirit lives on, tortured and restless, doomed to ride the deserted streets of his shattered domain.</p>

<p>The brigand leader mounts his horse, but before he can make good his escape, you take a running leap over the abbey wall and drag him out of the saddle. Together you crash to the frost-hardened ground and desperately he kicks and struggles to break free from your steely grip. Out of his boot he snatches a stiletto blade and thrusts it viciously at your throat. You dodge your head aside, avoiding its razor-sharp tip, but in doing so you let the brigand slip out of your hands. He rolls away and begins to rise to his feet, but then he freezes, his eyes wide with fearful recognition, as he stares at your face.</p>
<p>‘L…Lone Wolf!’ he gasps, mortified, as if he is confronting a ghost.</p>
<p>‘Drop the dagger and surrender!’ you order, levelling your weapon at his head to reinforce your command. Swiftly the brigand’s expression changes from one of shock to one of sneering defiance.</p>
<p>‘You’ll never take me alive!’ he spits, and to your shocked surprise he thrusts his dagger deep into his chest.</p>

<p>On the far side of the river you notice a milestone half-buried in a roadside ditch. Etched on its granite surface is a small arrow which points eastwards, and below reads the message ‘Abisko—25 miles’.</p>
<p>Later, as you approach the outskirts of this town, you notice a large flock of carrion crows circling above its timbered buildings. You sense that plague has recently visited this town, and so you leave the road and spend the night in woodland a few miles to the south.</p>
<p>The next day, the weather changes for the better. The temperature rises and the surface of the muddy road quickly becomes dry and hard. Ten miles east of Abisko you see a small regiment of Eldenoran soldiers camped out beside the road. They are busy with their luckless duty of having to burn the bodies of Abisko’s plague victims, which number in the hundreds. So preoccupied are they with their grim task that they fail to see you steal one of their horses and make off with it along the road which leads to Duadon—their capital city.</p>

<p>The road which crosses the plains to the east of the river is deeply rutted. Fortunately, though, it is dry, there having been little rain in these parts for weeks. Progress is good and by midday you and your troop have covered more than thirty miles. You pass many wagons on this road, mostly driven by farmers who are taking their crops to the markets and wharves of Garthen. These wagon drivers seem an unusually loyal and friendly breed; invariably they wave and cheer the moment they recognize the uniforms of Queen Evaine’s Court Cavalry.</p>
<p>After a brief rest at a village on the road, you continue your ride across the open plains and descend into a wide valley where a shallow stream winds its way through a mass of reed-beds and willow copses. Beyond this valley, the land becomes increasingly hilly. The sun is almost touching the horizon when you come to a small wayside shrine dedicated to the Goddess Ishir. Here a track leads off to the north and, a mile distant, you can make out the walls and tall bell-tower of a chateau high in the hills.</p>
<p>‘That’s the monastery of the Vaderish Brethren,’ says Nathor. ‘They’re a holy order devoted to the worship of the Goddess Ishir. We will find safe shelter with them this night.’</p>
<p>The sun has set and dusk is quickly turning to darkness by the time the troop reaches the gates of the Vaderish Monastery. The brothers of this holy order are led by an elderly monk called Rasbarin whom Nathor has met once before. The old cleric welcomes him warmly, as if he was his son, and then he invites you to stay here overnight.</p>
<p>The monks’ evening meal is simple fare but well-prepared and wholesome nonetheless (restore any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you may have lost during your adventure so far). Afterwards, Rasbarin invites you and Nathor to his chambers to sample some of the monks’ speciality—a fine liqueur called Aquas. You are raising a glass of this golden liquid to your lips when suddenly the peace is shattered by a loud, cawing shriek which echoes through the surrounding hills.</p>

He praises your horse enthusiastically and promises that he will look after him well while you are enjoying your visit to the tavern. On entering the taproom, you are welcomed by the mouth-watering smell of roasting beef and fine ale. The tavern is busy and nobody pays you any special attention as you take a seat by the counter.</p>
<p>At a nearby table, you notice an argument is brewing between a merchant and a man dressed in a shabby hide coat. The merchant is accusing the man of stealing a purse of gems from his pocket, and the confrontation is being made worse by a third man, a lank-haired bargee, who is siding with the merchant. The accused man pleads that he is innocent but the other two give no credence to his pleas. Suddenly, the merchant draws a dagger and threatens to slit the man’s throat unless he hands over the stolen gems at once.</p>

As Ardan disembarks, Nathor gives a signal to his men who are busy keeping an inquisitive crowd of citizens at bay.

Everywhere you look you see soldiers of the Royal Household in uniforms bedecked with glittering braid. A fanfare of trumpets announces your arrival and, with minimal delay, Nathor escorts you personally to the State Hall where Queen Evaine of Talestria, seated upon a throne and surrounded by a dozen of her court advisors, is waiting patiently for you to appear.</p>

They venture forth from the ruins of the Darklord cities of Nadgazad and Cragmantle, sent by the express command of Naar himself. They know now that you triumphed in Ixia and they are watching expectantly for your coming.’</p>
<p>‘I thank you for this information, your Majesty, but I am sure that I can avoid these night-riders,’ you reply confidently.</p>

<p>‘With respect, your majesty,’ you reply, tactfully masking your scepticism, ‘how do you know this to be true?’</p>
<p>‘Grand Master, it is true. I have heard it from the very lips of an assassin who was plotting your murder, here, in the heart of my capital.

<p>‘I will destroy the Shadow Gate tonight,’ you vow resolutely, ‘and tomorrow we shall celebrate Fehmarn, secure in the knowledge that a lasting peace has returned to our land.’</p>
<p>Moments later, a doleful bell sounds from atop the Durncrag Tower: it is the alarm.</p>
<p>‘Hurry, my lords!’ shouts a young Kai Savant who comes rushing breathlessly into the Grand Hall. ‘The enemy are attacking in force!’</p>
<p>‘To your battle positions, my lords!’ you command, as you stride towards the door. ‘The time has come for you to avenge your dead brothers. Fight well! Fight true! The spirit of the Sun-god Kai is with us this night!’</p>
<p>A great cloud of winged Lavas is speeding towards the monastery from the northwest and they will arrive within a few minutes at most. As you watch the young Kai Lords arm themselves and take up their positions around the monastery, you consider where best to position yourself for the imminent battle.</p>

<p>The numbing blast leaves you slumped against the wall of the pit. Rather than invite a second devastating blast from Lutha’s Ring of Power, you pretend to be dead in the hope that you may be able to escape when Lutha’s guards come to dispose of your body.</p>
<p>High above you, you hear Prince Lutha howling delightedly at the sight of your seemingly dead corpse. He calls for his guards and, a few minutes later, you hear them entering the pit. There follows the tinny sound of metal scraping on metal before you feel yourself being lifted by the shoulders and feet and lowered into a slippery chute. A wave of panic makes you open your eyes and struggle to break free of their grip. This sudden and unexpected resurrection in turn makes the guards scream and drop you. They scurry away, gibbering like idiots, and you are left to slide headlong down a chute which leads to a fast-flowing underground river. You hit the cold waters head-first and are carried swiftly away by the strong undercurrent.</p>

The surge of energy has great significance, for on the Plane of Darkness, Naar has just consigned his newest champions to the Shadow Gate through which you escaped from his realm.</p>
<p>As the first rays of the dawn sun spread across the surrounding rocks, the first of Naar’s mighty dragon herd emerge from the Shadow Gate. Drawn by the glow of the Sun-crystal, they descend on your unconscious form and, in a frenzy of retribution, they rend you limb from limb.</p>

You grab hold of their tunics, one in each hand, and drag their bodies out of the cell into the cleaner air of the corridor beyond. Here you use your Magnakai Discipline of Curing to ease the effects of the poison gas; your skill and the swiftness of your actions undoubtedly save them from a painful, suffocating death.</p>

<p>You peer into the cell at the man now hanging limply in chains, and then you turn to Nathor and say: ‘Suicide. A suicide and an attempted murder, that is. The prisoner has just killed himself with a poison pellet and it seems his last wish was to take all three of us with him.’</p>

<p>From the crystal ring there pours forth a torrent of energy, a crackling vortex of evil power that whirls around and around the wall of the circular shaft as it slowly descends towards you. Tugging the Sommerswerd from its scabbard, you hold the golden blade aloft and brace yourself for the moment the two powers collide. The tip of the swirling vortex is drawn to your blade like lightning to a conductor, and upon the instant it touches the tip, there is a blinding flash. An electrifying jolt runs through your body and a deafening screech splits the air. For a terrifying moment the tip of the Sommerswerd becomes molten and begins to lose its rigidity; then there is another flash, and the power of the ring rebounds from your divine blade and returns towards its source, conquered and repelled by the goodly might of the Sword of the Sun.</p>

<p>Gwynian ushers you through into an adjoining chamber where floating bulbs of light illuminate a stone table covered with charts and scrolls.</p>
<p>‘What news have you of Sommerlund?’ you ask anxiously.</p>
<p>‘Grave news,’ replies Gwynian, with an ominous tone. He picks up a chart from the table and traces a finger across the intricate lines and calculations that embellish its ancient yellowed surface.</p>
<p>‘The Dark God Naar has opened a Shadow Gate in the Durncrag Mountains, a corridor between our world and his. By means of this corridor he has sent a host of winged creatures—the Lavas—to assail your monastery. It is his plan to destroy the young order of Kai warriors while you are not able to lead them. The Shadow Gate opened at the time of the last full moon and, since then, the Kai Monastery has been attacked many times. Naar’s servants have your stronghold encircled and cut off from the armies of King Ulnar, who has repeatedly sought to break the siege. Your Kai have withstood the attacks well, Lone Wolf, but they are weakening. Only you can save them now.’</p>
<p>‘But how?’ you ask, shaken by Gwynian’s account of the events which have occurred during your absence from the monastery. ‘If the armies of King Ulnar are powerless to break the siege, how can I hope to save my brethren?’</p>
<p>‘Do not despair, Lone Wolf,’ replies Gwynian, reassuringly. ‘All is not yet lost. You can save your brave order by closing the gate through which Naar sends his Lavas minions.’</p>
<p>You are about to ask how you could possibly achieve this, how you could close the Shadow Gate, but your urgent question is forestalled when Gwynian raises his hand.</p>
<p>‘Patience for just a moment, Lone Wolf,’ he says and he allows himself a smile. ‘I, humble Gwynian, possess the means by which you can thwart the Dark God’s murderous plan.’</p>

<p>While riding the road to Duadon, you search the bags which hang from the saddle of your newfound horse. Among the things they contain are a spare Eldenoran uniform and rain-cape. You throw the uniform away, but you sling the voluminous cape around your shoulders and fix the clasp under your chin. Mindful of the increased risks of detection the nearer you get to Duadon, this simple black cape serves two useful purposes: it keeps hidden your Kai clothes and gives you the outward appearance of an Eldenoran horseman. (You need not record this cape on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>

<p>During the remaining daylight hours, you frequently see units of Eldenorans on the road, most marching westwards with long pikes over their shoulders. None of them challenge you as you pass them by, for they assume you are a cavalry scout going about his duty. After spending a comfortable night in the loft of a deserted hay barn, you continue your ride at first light and reach the outskirts of Duadon shortly before midday.</p>
<p>The Eldenoran capital is a grey and unlovely place. Its cold stone buildings bear the scars of a city whose history is one of near-continual warfare. The roads leading to the city gates are crowded with regiments on the move, and soon you find yourself caught up to a large body of troops which is snaking slowly towards Duadon’s heavily fortified western approach. The mood of the troops is one of studied indifference, a condition which often prevails in those who have become emotionally numbed by the horrors of war. As this sullen mass moves through the west gate, you glance up at the battlements and notice a red-robed figure clutching a long staff of glowing white metal. A tingle of apprehension runs the length of your spine when you recognize the figure to be a Cener Druid. The staff he holds radiates a magical aura and you sense at once that he is scanning the arriving soldiers, using the staff to determine, amongst other things, if any have contracted plague. Suddenly the Cener becomes agitated and he sprints the length of the battlements to sound an alarm bell. Within a few moments, the west gate is sealed by a heavy iron portcullis and panic sweeps through the troops who have been shut outside. You look up at the battlements once more and this time your heart skips a beat; the Cener is pointing his glowing staff directly at your head.</p>

<p>‘Very well, Grand Master, if this is the way you choose to proceed with your journey, then you are welcome to ride with me.’</p>
<p>You accept Cearmaine’s offer and, within the hour, you and he are on the road once more, this time riding north on horseback towards the battle that is raging at the Reloni Bridge. When you are three miles from the river you can see the night sky lit up by the fires of war. At two miles, the sounds of singing steel and dying men can be heard on the wind. At a mile distant, you see fields littered with the wounded and dying recently evacuated from the front, and regiments of young Palmyrion reserves nervously awaiting their turn to go forward. And when at last you catch sight of the bridge itself, your stomach churns as you witness the carnage being wrought there.</p>
<p>The bridge and the surrounding banks of the river are carpeted with dead and dying men, twisted into impossible shapes. Massive engines of war bombard the soldiers on both sides, raining fiery death and destruction upon their heads. You have seen many battles in your time, but none to rival the savagery of the conflict that is unfolding here.</p>
<p>Cearmaine catches hold of a young lieutenant whose face is covered with dried blood. Part of his scalp has been sliced away but he seems unaware of his gaping wound. Cearmaine barks a question and the man answers him by pointing to a regiment of pikemen stationed on a distant hill.</p>
<p>‘There stand the Black Ravens—my son’s men. I must away now, Grand Master, so I bid you farewell. The enemy have been repulsed this last hour and are gathering themselves for their next attack. If you are determined to cross the water to their side, you should attempt it now, before they advance again.’ Cearmaine turns his horse about and makes ready to ride off. ‘By the gods, Grand Master, you are brave to have chosen this road home!’ he says, saluting you. ‘I wish you luck—may Kai and Ishir keep you safe. Farewell, my friend. Farewell!’</p>
<p>As the captain gallops away, you look with mounting dread at the slaughter. To cross the river by the bridge is impossible; the only ways across are either upstream to the north, or downstream to the south. To the north you see a dense wall of trees on the far bank, which, judging by the number of arrow-struck bodies lying nearby, you hazard is full of enemy archers. To the south, the far shore is a mass of heavily fortified trenches filled to overflowing with Eldenoran assault troops.</p>

<p>As the last of your attackers collapses at your feet, you turn and run headlong down the steep hill track. Arrows and spears whistle past on all sides as you endeavour to outrun the remaining ambushers. By dint of luck and speed, Nathor and his troop of Court Cavalry have survived the Eldenoran ambush with little injury and no loss of life. You see them in the distance, gathered in a group on the valley floor, and you wave to them to show that you are still alive. Immediately Nathor gallops away from the troop and comes speeding up the track to your rescue. As he gets nearer he slows his horse to allow you to leap astride its rump. Once aboard, he pulls his steed about and descends once more towards the valley floor, cheered on by his anxious men.</p>
<p>‘Follow me!’ commands the Lord Constable as he gallops past his troop without slowing. You glance over your shoulder and see them spur their steeds forward, their faces set in expressions of grim determination. Upon entering the village, you note a number of frightened women and children who are huddled beside stone walls or lying beneath hay carts. Some are cradling the bodies of their dead menfolk who lie scattered in the fields nearby. Then you catch sight of a group of Eldenorans in the grounds of the abbey. All are laden with loot, yet even so there are some who are squabbling amongst themselves in an effort to grab an even bigger share of the booty.</p>
<p>Nathor brings his steed to a halt and you both quickly dismount. As your feet touch the ground, you notice a drunken Eldenoran come lurching out of the doorway of a nearby cottage. He has a flagon of ale in one hand, and a young woman with a crying baby in the other. He sees you and, in a moment of drunken panic, he drops the flagon and unsheathes a dagger from his belt. It is clear from his actions that he intends to stab the screaming child.</p>

In the dim half-light you watch with a mixture of fascination and revulsion as these vicious rats burrow nose-first into the evil-smelling mire, pausing only to fight when one of them uncovers the prey that they are hunting for: glistening, black-bodied worms.</p>
<p>Using your Magnakai skill of Nexus, you are able to free your hands from the cords that bind them. Escape from this pit is now foremost in your mind. Beyond the wall you can hear the sound of rushing water and, when you move to where the sound is loudest, you discover a panel partially concealed by slime. A closer inspection reveals it to be an opening to a circular chute. You are working on a way to prise open this panel, hoping it will lead to a way out of the pit, when suddenly there is a grating rumble high above. A column of bright light invades the gloom and, squealing with fright, the rats burrow frantically into the slime to avoid it.</p>

His pointed beard and moustache are trimmed to perfection, and his dark eyes twinkle with a cold malevolence that places a chill in your very soul. His skin is unusually pale and, judging from the wealth of gold embellishment that bedecks the neck of his velvet tunic, you feel sure that he is Prince Lutha, the self-appointed ruler of this city.</p>

<p>You are woken by the clammy sensation of fine cold spray on your face. Reluctantly you prise open your sleep-clogged eyes and see that the sky above is uniformly grey, swaddled by a thick blanket of cloud. A fine drizzle is sweeping down across the plateau, but the darkening clouds above indicate that this is merely the prelude to heavier rain.</p>
<p>Sure enough, within the hour you find yourself trekking north through a torrential downpour. The heavy rain makes the going difficult, but you take some comfort in the fact that it will lessen the odds of a chance encounter with an Eldenoran patrol.</p>
<p>Later in the day you come to a ridge which overlooks a sizeable town positioned at the centre of a wide valley. A glance at your <a href="#map">map</a> confirms your suspicion that this town is Oredal, and, when you magnify your vision, you see that it is swarming with Eldenoran troops and horsemen. You decide to give this town a wide berth and you stay in the hills to avoid the risk of being detected. For two days you live off the land as you make your way steadily northwards. Despite the bad weather, and having to go on foot, you make excellent progress. On the morning of the third day you come to a wood overlooking a small village called Nursha, which sits astride the main Rioma road. In the centre of this town there is a junction where another wide road branches off to the east. A large signpost at the junction says ‘Abisko—40 miles’.</p>
<p>From the dry shelter of the wood you observe the town for nearly an hour, but you detect no movement there whatsoever: the place appears to be completely deserted.</p>

<p>For an hour you ride across the rich grasslands of eastern Talestria until you come to a range of hills that are carpeted with scented spruce and pine.

<p>When you focus your Kai senses upon this device, you suddenly realize its true purpose: it detects light in the infrared spectrum. It is a means by which the Cener Druid can locate objects in the dark by the heat radiating from them. Many of the men, whose corpses now provide you with cover, were detected crossing the river this way.</p>
<p>Forewarned by your advanced mastery, you slip back into the water and allow the current to carry you a few hundred yards downstream. Here you discover a shallow bay in the river bank which affords you cover from the device, and also from the nearest enemy trench. Quickly you slither like a snake up the muddy bank and drop silently into this trench. A dull-witted Eldenoran is quickly dispatched with a blow from the edge of your hand, enabling you to move further along this log-walled ditch. Just as you are passing the opening to a makeshift dugout, you sense danger ahead.

It is the Elector’s Hall—the seat of the Palmyrion republic.</p>
<p>Trumpets announce your arrival as you stride through the hall’s great arched doors. Senators and officials stop momentarily to stare; then their attentions return to their affairs of state which strike you as unusually urgent. It is almost midnight, yet the Elector’s Hall is a buzzing hive of activity. You meet with Elector Manatine in his War Room where he and his generals are poring over maps and battle reports. He welcomes you with a warm handshake but his countenance seems unusually dour and agitated. You are soon to learn why.</p>

<p>You draw and fire an Arrow in the blink of an eye. The shaft whistles through the trees and hits the war-dog squarely between its hideously yellow eyes. For a few seconds it continues to bound forward; then its front legs collapse beneath its weight and it crashes, nose-first, into the soft forest earth.</p>
<p>Swiftly you shoulder your Bow and run headlong into the trees, desperate to make use of what little time you have gained by slaying the pack leader.</p>

<p>You leave the cell and return to the State Hall where Lord Constable Nathor reports what has happened to the Queen. Concerned for your safety, she suggests that you spend the night at the Royal Citadel as her guest. You accept her gracious invitation and enjoy a fine feast and the hospitality of her court. Then, shortly after dawn of the following day, you bid her Majesty and your companion—Lord Ardan—a fond farewell before beginning the next stage of your long journey home.</p>
<p>Mindful of the dangers, the Queen gives her Lord Constable a Royal Seal and places him, along with a troop of ten Court Cavalrymen, at your disposal. Lord Nathor and his men are to act as your guides and bodyguards on the road to Vanamor, the capital city of neighbouring Palmyrion. This republic is closely allied to Talestria and lies along its eastern border. Palmyrion also has close ties with your homeland and you look forward to the chance of renewing your friendship with its leader, Elector Manatine.</p>
<p>Mounted on fine Talestrian steeds, your party leaves the walled city of Garthen by its East Gate. Here you cross a great stone bridge on the far side of which is a signpost pointing to the east. It reads ‘Vanamor 280 miles’.</p>

<p>It is near midnight when you arrive at a ridge which commands a view of the mighty River Storn. Moonlight pours molten silver over the rushing water, illuminating a ford where a crossing can be made over this unusually deep and fast-flowing river. To the far horizon stretch the plains of Slovia, peaceful and inviting. You long to be on the other side, but you suspect that crossing here, despite the ford, will not be an easy task. Heavily fortified border posts stand at the approaches to the ford, and many keen-eyed sentries are scanning the surrounding countryside on both sides of the river. The Eldenorans are watching for deserters attempting to flee to the safety of Slovia, a neutral territory in the war against Palmyrion; the Slovians keep watch for signs of an Eldenoran attack. It would not be the first time an invasion by their hostile neighbour had come this way.</p>
<p>Patiently you observe the ford for more than an hour, trying to determine the optimum time to make your move, but then suddenly the choice is taken out of your hands. In the middle distance you see an Eldenoran patrol riding towards the ridge. Unless you abandon the ridge at once, they will be sure to see you and raise an alarm.</p>
<p>Taking your courage in both hands, you spur your horse to the gallop and rush headlong down the rocky slope that leads directly to the ford.</p>

<p>Gradually the wounded dragon yields his ground. He twists his head violently back and forth, as if he is trying to cast away the pain; then slowly he turns his back on you and lumbers towards his herd.</p>
<p>You seize this opportunity to make a dash for the Shadow Gate. However, the wraith-like manifestation of Naar senses your intention and sends his Lavas swooping down to block your path. Hurriedly they form up in a line at the entrance to the Shadow Gate, forcing you to fight or retreat. Knowing that they block your only means of escaping from this nightmare realm, you draw your weapon and hurl yourself against them in a frenzied attempt to break through their line.<sup><a href="#sect344-1-foot" name="sect344-1">5</a></sup></p>

<p>As the last of the winged horrors comes crashing to the ground, slain by your deadly blows, you take off at a run towards the trees. You rush headlong into the forest and glance overhead to make doubly sure that you are not being tracked by more of the winged Lavas. The darkening sky is clear of the enemy and confidently you press on through the trees, sure in your ability to remain undetected now that you are in your natural environment of the forest.</p>
<p>Soon you reach the clearing and hurry to a boulder which bears the imprint of a human hand. You place your right hand upon it and the imprint fits around it like a glove. Silently a hinged stone slab rises up from the ground revealing a stair that leads down into a brick-lined passageway. You enter and hurry along this familiar tunnel, covering a mile before you come to a door that opens automatically at your approach. Beyond lies the Vault of the Sun, your personal stronghold. It radiates a warm golden light: the rays of the Lorestones of Nyxator. Once safely inside your underground lair, you pause to allow the radiant light of the Lorestones to wash over your tired and aching limbs and, within the space of a few heartbeats, the fatigue of your long journey home is melted away (restore all lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>

<p>You smile at the young Kai Master who now has tears of joy in his steel-grey eyes.</p>

As the last one falls to your blows, you urge your horse away from the coppice and set off along the river track to Scade.</p>
<p>On returning to the Lucky Bucket Inn, you break the news of your encounter at Castle Tranius to the remaining five troopers. It comes as a shock, both to them and to the innkeeper, who fears for the safety of the real Knight Tranius.</p>
<p>‘I haven’t seen him in the town for near-on a week,’ he says, anxiously rubbing his many chins. ‘We ’ere had no inkling that somethin’ bad was happenin’ up there at the castle. It’s right put the shakes up me, I can tell you.’</p>

<p>Immediately you recognize the kindly face of Gwynian the Sage.</p>
<p>‘Fate calls us together once more, Lone Wolf,’ he says. ‘Come, we have much to discuss.’</p>
<p>And with that he ushers you through the archway into an adjoining chamber, where floating bulbs of light illuminate a stone table covered with charts and scrolls.</p>
<p>‘What news have you of Sommerlund?’ you ask, anxiously.</p>
<p>‘Grave news,’ replies Gwynian, with an ominous tone. He picks up a chart from the table and traces a finger across the intricate lines and calculations that embellish its ancient yellowed surface.</p>
<p>‘The Dark God Naar has opened a Shadow Gate in the Durncrag Mountains, a corridor between our world and his. By means of this corridor he has sent a host of winged creatures—the Lavas—to assail your monastery. It is his plan to destroy the young order of Kai warriors while you are not able to lead them. The Shadow Gate opened at the time of the last full moon and, since then, the Kai Monastery has been attacked many times. Naar’s servants have your stronghold encircled and cut off from the armies of King Ulnar, who has repeatedly sought to break the siege. Your Kai have withstood the attacks well, Lone Wolf, but they are weakening. Only you can save them now.’</p>
<p>‘But how?’ you ask, shaken by Gwynian’s account of the events which have occurred during your absence from the monastery. ‘If the armies of King Ulnar are powerless to break the siege, how can I hope to save my brethren?’</p>
<p>‘Do not despair, Lone Wolf,’ replies Gwynian, reassuringly. ‘All is not yet lost. You can save your brave order by closing the gate through which Naar sends his Lavas minions.’</p>
<p>You are about to ask how you could possibly achieve this, how you could close the Shadow Gate, but your urgent question is forestalled when Gwynian raises his hand.</p>
<p>‘Patience for just a moment, Lone Wolf,’ he says, and he allows himself a smile. ‘I, humble Gwynian, possess the means by which you can thwart the Dark God’s murderous plan.’</p>

<p>You leave the wood and make your way across open fields to a farm at the edge of the town. Here, among the outbuildings of this deserted property, you make a shocking discovery. The burnt remains of men, women, and children are heaped in small mounds all over the farmyard. Open trenches, containing fire-blackened bones and skulls, have been dug in lines behind the farmhouse, and cattle carcasses fill the ditches which border the muddy road into the town. You detect no life at all; not even a bird or lowly farm animal wanders freely here.</p>

<p>There is a blinding flash as the Sun-crystal passes through the Shadow Gate, and a deafening implosion follows which sucks a whirlwind of air and loose rock into its whirling core. For a few moments you hear a terrible, far-off scream: it is the lonely cry of Naar himself, lamenting the destruction of his dragon herd, which, by your action, you have consigned to oblivion. The vortex continues to whirl but it is growing smaller as its collapsing power fades. It shrinks and shrinks until, with a final <i>Crack!</i> it disappears completely.</p>
<p>You return to the monastery where, upon your arrival at the north gate, you are treated to the loud and joyous applause of the young Kai warriors. Banedon and Rimoah praise and congratulate you for your victory over the minions of Naar; it is a victory that will long be remembered in the history of Sommerlund and the legends of the Kai.</p>

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>

Likely, the author intended the Weaponmastery bonus at the Mentora rank to be a ‘hidden loyalty bonus’ (cf. <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/ReadersHandbook/NewsletterExcerpts#lwcn28">Lone Wolf Club Newsletter 28</a>). In view of this, the +2 Mentora bonus is therefore <em>not</em> cumulative with Grand Weaponmastery with Bow.</p>
