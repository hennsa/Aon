   <p>The Claw of Naar is the evil wand of power used by Agarash the Damned during his ancient conquest of Magnamund. Legend held that it had been lost forever in the molten ruins of Naaros, but now it has resurfaced, and its dread return heralds a dawn of disaster for the peaceable nations of Magnamund. Your allies, the wise wizards of the Elder Magi, have the power and the means to destroy the accursed Claw. But they do not possess it. In <strong><cite>Vampirium</cite></strong>, you must venture into the hostile land of Bhanar and snatch the Claw from the clutches of the evil Autarch Sejanoz. Can you deliver the Claw safely to the Elder Magi…or will you be destroyed by the terrifying wrath of the vampire lord Sejanoz?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>It is spring in the year MS 5085 and you are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai, the warrior élite of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>Thirty-five years ago, the First Order of the Kai was massacred by the Darklords of Helgedad, a host of powerful creatures sent by the evil God Naar to destroy the world of Magnamund. Lone Wolf, the supreme leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of their attack upon the Kai. As a young initiate he stood amid the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. Twenty years later he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>
<p>With the destruction of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly, their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war, allowing the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>
<p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and a New Order was established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS 5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old, you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. Your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by years of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and swiftly you rose through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement that has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>
<p>In the year MS 5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf’s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your fellow warriors maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King’s Army of Sommerlund.<sup><a href="#tssf-1-foot" name="tssf-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>During the seven years since the defeat of his minions, Naar has sought vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and they wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to serve their fell master.</p>
<p>You have recently returned to the monastery after successfully completing a dangerous mission in the Kingdom of Bor.<sup><a href="#tssf-2-foot" name="tssf-2">2</a></sup> The vast underground realm of Bor is home to the Drodarin dwarves, the oldest allies of the Kai. Forbidden excavations in the lowest levels of the kingdom had awoken and released the Shom’zaa—a supernatural creature entombed by Magnamund’s earliest magicians, the Elder Magi, during their ancient war against Naar’s legendary champion: Agarash the Damned.</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi, travelled with you to Bor aboard a wondrous flying ship called <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> and, with his help, you were able to defeat the Shom’zaa and save your Drodarin allies from destruction.</p>
<p>Three months after you returned from Bor, Lord Rimoah came to the Kai Monastery aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. His visit was unexpected and you sensed at once that something was wrong. Lone Wolf summoned you to his chamber where, with mounting dread, you listened to Lord Rimoah’s account of events in Southern Magnamund that threaten to destroy the fragile peace of that continent.</p>
<p>The Elder Magi had received word from King Karvas of Siyen that Autarch Sejanoz, the evil ruler of Bhanar, had secretly dispatched a squad of his Imperial Guards into the Doomlands of Naaros. At first, neither the King nor the Elders could fathom a reason why the Autarch had done this. The Doomlands are one of the most inhospitable regions in all of Magnamund, a barren wasteland of ash and cinders that once was the domain of Agarash the Damned. At its centre stood his mighty fortress-city of Naaros. Yet, following his defeat by the Elder Magi, all that remains of it now is a titanic chasm of molten lava and heat-fused rock.</p>
<p>Fearing for the security of his southern borderlands, King Karvas sent a group of élite Siyenese rangers into the Doomlands to spy on the Autarch’s men in the hope of discovering their true purpose. When, after six weeks, nothing was heard from the group, the King and his court assumed they had perished. Then a few days later, Karvas received word unexpectedly from his missing men. They had tracked the squad of the Autarch’s Imperial Guard deep into the Doomlands, and they had observed them excavating an unmarked burial mound near to the ruins of Naaros. And it was here that they were to witness a chilling discovery, for buried beneath the mound lay the Claw of Naar.</p>
<p>The Claw of Naar is an ancient wand of power that was crafted by the evil God himself, and used by Agarash the Damned during his conquest of Magnamund. Legend held that it had been lost forever in the molten ruin of Naaros, but now it had resurfaced, and its return boded trouble for the peaceable nations bordering upon the Autocracy of Bhanar.</p>
<p>The rangers reported that the Autarch’s squad were returning to Bhanar with the Claw in their possession. Their chosen route would take them through the Southern Dammerdon Mountains and so the rangers went ahead to hide themselves in Sunderer Pass where they intended to await their arrival. Their plan was to ambush the squad in the narrow confines of the pass and steal away the Claw. However, the ranger leader was fearful that the power of the Claw might overwhelm his small group. He requested of his King that help be sent urgently. Karvas responded to his plea by seeking the aid of the Elder Magi, and upon hearing of the situation, Lord Rimoah readily agreed to assist.</p>
<p>‘In turn, Lone Wolf, I have come this day to ask for the help of the Kai,’ said Rimoah. ‘We of the Elder Magi have the power and the means to destroy the Claw of Naar, but only when we have that accursed object in our possession. To secure the Claw will require skills and courage that only the Kai possess. And so, I come here seeking your aid, Supreme Master.’</p>
<p>‘It will not be an easy task,’ replied Lone Wolf, thoughtfully, ‘but we have the advantage of both speed and surprise. Sunderer Pass is no more than a day’s journey away by skyship.’</p>
<p>‘Aye,’ replied Rimoah, ‘but we must depart this afternoon if we are to be certain of reaching the pass before the arrival of the Autarch’s squad.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf slowly turned to face you. ‘I am tempted to accept this challenge myself, Grand Master,’ he said, as he held you with his unblinking gaze. ‘But, alas, I must attend a War Council tomorrow at the King’s Court in Holmgard. Will you journey to Bhanar in my stead and help Lord Rimoah to capture the Claw of Naar?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, my lord,’ you replied, without hesitation. ‘For the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Kai, I am proud to accept this task.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>) and physical stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 32). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21–26), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to this adventure.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">3</a></sup> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>
<h3><a name="kainame">Your Kai Name</a></h3>

<p>It has long been the tradition of your élite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year’s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
<p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

<h4><a name="nodispln">New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines</a></h4>

<p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor—Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf—you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines.

<h4><a name="kaiweapn">Kai Weapons</a></h4>

<p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the élite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>
<p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a href="#action">Special Items List</a>.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe ‘Alema’.</p>
<p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you were to use ‘Alema’ in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of +7 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> would remain at +5.</p>

<h4><a name="howuse">Equipment—How to use it</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct Weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this Weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful Weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is best to equip yourself also with a close combat Weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is 12.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai Weapon</dt>
<dd>Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal Weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This is in addition to the bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your five Disciplines, then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Bhanar is the Ren. 10 Ren equals 1 Gold Crown. These coins are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns (or 500 Ren).<br /><br />

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
You, Grand Master (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. You also possess the Kai Weapon ‘Ulnarias’, so you add an additional 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This gives you a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 45.<br /><br />
You now subtract the Wild Dogs’ <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45−31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself—Grand Master.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>You (GM) lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
<li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of New Order Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership.

<dd>Kai Sun Knights with this skill are able to repel at will all normal-sized insects within a radius of three yards. The range and number of insects so affected increase considerably as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature’s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing process takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state, the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Astrology</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who have this Discipline are skilled in the art of chiromancy—the ability to tell fortunes from the skin creases and patterns found on the palms of hands.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to use their musical skills to launch sonic attacks against any individual within audible range. The effect of a sonic attack is dependent upon the target creature’s sensitivity to sound (i.e. a deaf creature would be unaffected by such an attack).<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Halt Missile</i>—This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2–3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight time in which to move away from the missile’s line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Strength</i>—By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>
</ul><br /><br />

<h4><a name="sunlord">Sun Lord</a></h4>

<p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Sun Lord, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a Weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden Weapon such as a Quarterstaff.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Herbmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to cause living plants, e.g. grasses, bushes, flowers, weeds, rushes, to entwine themselves around the limbs of hostile creatures, thereby hampering their free movement. Sun Lords are able to target only one creature in this way. An additional creature can be affected for every level a Grand Master rises above the rank of Sun Lord.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see the complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast—a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a ‘0’ = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration—and degree of surface difficulty—increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Lord are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Penetrate</i>—This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow, or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
<li><i>Energy Grasp</i>—This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i>. It differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or enemy to effect the spell.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to direct their musical abilities to disrupt the structure of inanimate breakable objects, e.g. glass, ceramics, urns, flasks, causing them to explode violently. Any person or creature in close proximity to the destroyed object risks injury from flying fragments.<br /><br />
</dd>

<p>Grand Master, you are about to embark upon a vital mission to deny Autarch Sejanoz the Claw of Naar, an ancient yet deadly artefact of evil. During your quest to distant Bhanar you will encounter many strong and cunning adversaries, and your mission will be fraught with danger at every turn, so remain on your guard at all times.</p>
<p>Some of the material items that you find will be of use to you, but others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items during your mission, be selective in what you choose to keep. Pick your initial five Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1–26) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>
<p>May the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir guide and protect you during your mission in the sinister realm of Bhanar.</p>

<p>Within the hour, you find yourself standing beside Lord Rimoah at the deck-rail of the sleek flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>, watching the Kai Monastery melt away into the distance as the craft soars into an azure sky. The weather is fresh and clear, and you are blessed with a strong tail wind that will assist your long journey south to the land of Bhanar.</p>
<p>Rimoah has already charted a course for Sunderer Pass, and as his young Toranese crew attend to the running of the skyship, you settle back into the plush comfort of the captain’s cabin and discuss with him the details of your mission. After a delicious supper, you retire early and rise late in order to be best prepared for the task ahead.</p>
<p>By noon of the next day, you have already crossed the Tentarias and entered into Southern Magnamund. You spend much of the early afternoon standing at the bow rail, lost in your thoughts as an endless panoply of rolling hills and grasslands pass silently beneath <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>’s gleaming keel.</p>
<p>When the forbidding peaks of the Darkwall Mountains are sighted on the horizon, Rimoah takes charge of the helm and steers the skyship on a southeasterly bearing to avoid them. These mountains mark the northern boundary of the Doomlands of Naaros, and Rimoah is anxious to avoid this notoriously stormy region. Skilfully he navigates a course around the eastern boundary of the Doomlands until, late in the afternoon, you see the snow-capped tips of the Southern Dammerdon Mountains soar into view.</p>
<p>Rimoah passes the helm back to his bo’sun, and then he hurries to join you at the bow rail. ‘Keep your eyes peeled, Grand Master,’ he says. ‘Sunderer Pass is a narrow gorge. It’ll be hard to spot from here.’ Aided by your ability to magnify your vision, you are the first one to see the tiny pass. Rimoah praises your keen sight and he signals to the bo’sun to bring <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> around to the southern slopes of the Dammerdons, to a place where the pass emerges from the mountain range. Here you notice a pale cross of sun-bleached boulders laid out on the dark, dusty ground. It is a sign Rimoah has been hoping for, and excitedly he calls for the bo’sun to steer the skycraft towards it.</p>
<p><cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> is brought to hover directly above the cross. You leave the rail and accompany Rimoah into a boarding cage located at the stern, and together you are winched to the ground. As the cage touches down, you push open its iron gate and step out. Your pulse quickens when suddenly you see four shadowy figures emerging from the surrounding rocks.</p>

<p>You make a wide detour around the encampment before continuing your ride south. It is mid-afternoon when you see a settlement in the distance, one of many that can be found on the fringes of the Yua Tzhan province. As you are passing through this ragged plains village, you see a busy market in operation. The traders and their costumers stop to stare as you ride past; their eyes drawn by the unusual cut and colour of your tunics.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small5.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>Gildas points to a clothes stall that is heaped with simple straw-coloured robes, much favoured by these Bhanarian plains-dwellers. ‘Maybe a wise purchase, Sir Kai?’ he mutters. ‘I fear our tunics may arouse yet more suspicion the further south we venture.’ You nod in agreement and halt to ask the trader how much he wants for four of his robes.</p>
<p>‘One hundred and fifty Ren,’ he replies, breezily.</p>
<p>The trader’s price is the equivalent to 15 Gold Crowns. The rangers do not have any money, so if you wish to purchase these garments you must pay the full price.</p>
<p class="choice">If you can afford to pay the trader’s price, <a href="#sect218">turn to 218</a>.</p>

<p>Your tracking skills tell you that this hut was abandoned by its owner earlier this morning. Its log stove is still warm, and a plate of food lies untouched on the table. You share out the food and dry your clothes by the stove. Sergeant Paviz keeps watch at the window in case a patrol should come by to search the hut.</p>
<p>As midnight approaches, the enemy activity in Zuda decreases. Gildas suggests you should leave during the night to minimize risk of discovery; the darkness provides invaluable cover. You agree, and after midnight you set out for the town.</p>
<p>Bhanarian soldiers are billeted in most of the shops and houses. You keep to the back streets to avoid the patrols, but every alley and avenue leads to the market square at the centre of the town, and you cannot avoid passing through this area. In the middle of the square a magnificent tent has been erected. High above flies a scarlet flag emblazoned with a gold tiger’s head. This is Sejanoz’s personal flag and it signifies that the Autarch is here in person. A dozen of his best soldiers guard his tent, and parked beside its entrance are two strange machines.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="small6.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>The first is an elaborate shrine. It is fashioned from gold and jewels and has been crafted into the likeness of a tiger’s head. Two huge ivory fangs protrude from its jaw and its jewelled eyes glow with a flickering scarlet fire.</p>
<p>The second is a golden chariot. This vehicle has no team of horses to pull it, for it needs no animals to cause it to move. It is a sky chariot, powered by the same magical forces that enable <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> to soar through the air.</p>
<p>You are observing the shrine from the cover of a doorway when suddenly the head slowly rotates in your direction, and two pencil-thin beams of red light shoot from its eyes. You duck back, but it is too late—the shrine has detected your presence. The guards at the tent raise the alarm and a troop of Bhanarians come running from the doorway of a nearby hall.</p>
<p>‘Run!’ cries Gildas, as the soldiers come rushing towards you.</p>

<p>Upon your safe return, you tell Paviz and Yalin of what you observed at the copse.</p>
<p>‘They’re unaware we’ve caught up with them,’ says Captain Gildas, smiling slyly.</p>
<p>‘Yes, and we must exploit our advantage to the full,’ you reply. ‘You and your men must untie their horses and scatter them so that they cannot pursue us when I snatch the Claw of Naar, literally, from beneath their leader’s nose.’</p>
<p>The rangers approve of your plan and they are eager to put it into action. Gildas and his men mount up and skirt around the copse in a wide arc until they are in position on the far side, within sight of the enemy’s unguarded mounts. They take your horse in tow, for your plan is to rejoin them and make a speedy escape as soon as you have retrieved the Claw. Meanwhile, you approach the copse and halt within sight of the campfire. Only one of the Imperial Guardsmen is still awake, and although he has been posted to stand watch, you see that he is having difficulty keeping his eyes open. The squad leader is tossing and turning in his sleep, as if he is having a bad dream, and as you inch closer to him you fear that he could awaken at any moment.</p>

<p>Before you release your bowstring, you recite the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <i>Flameshaft</i> and a magical blue flame engulfs your Arrow’s tip. Then you send your fiery missile arcing towards a pool of oil on the ground in front of the charging Xanon. It plunges into the black puddle and ignites with a terrific <i>Whoomph!</i> exploding a searing ball of flame and black smoke into the air. The heat of the fireball forces the Xanon to retreat, but as they pull back, you become aware of a new threat.</p>
<p>Some Xanon have ridden in a wide arc around the ruins and have come up behind your position. You hear their leader snorting gruffly as he leaps into the ruined hall, and quickly you spin around to face him. Shouldering your Bow, you unsheathe your Kai Weapon and leap forward to block him before he can launch a surprise attack upon the backs of your three companions.</p>

<p>You are halfway around the perimeter of the hall when suddenly you are seen by the soldiers at the table. Some grab their weapons and come rushing at you, while others leave the hall to raise the alarm. You fight well and slay those who attack you, but the hall is soon awash with reinforcements and you are forced to surrender.</p>
<p>The rangers are also captured, and together you are taken before the Sergeant of the Guard. He denounces you as would-be thieves, out to steal provisions, and he orders that your weapons and equipment be confiscated before you are led away and thrown into the dungeons.</p>
<p>As the heavy door to your cell slams shut, you immediately look for a way out of this grim prison chamber. You try to pick the lock, but your attempt is thwarted when the sergeant and his guards return. With them is the squad leader of the Imperial Guard, the same man from whom you took the Claw of Naar. He is carrying the accursed artefact, and when the iron door is opened, he points it at you and triggers a fearsome blast of raw energy. In the cramped confines of the cell there is no hope of escaping from its terrible power. In the blink of an eye, you and your brave companions are engulfed and consumed by a terrifying ball of white-hot fire.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your mission end here in the barracks dungeon of Yua Tzhan.</p>

<p>As the nausea subsides, you see the Autarch come stalking forwards, slashing and scything at you with his needle-claws. He is like an angry tiger. As you duck below one sweeping attack, he catches you in the back with a lightning-fast following strike. His needle-claws become embedded in your Backpack, and it is wrenched from your back when he sends you crashing headlong against the chamber wall: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.

<p>Beyond the door you discover an empty chamber with a flight of spiral steps. You check your Siyenese Compass and then you lead the rangers up these iron stairs to a wide corridor on the floor above.</p>
<p>You instruct Gildas and his men to wait at the top of the staircase while you make sure the way ahead is clear. Tall arched windows march past on either side as you approach a door at the end of the passageway. You detect the aroma of roasting meat and hear the sounds of feasting, and when you peep through the door’s keyhole, you see a soldiers’ mess hall beyond.</p>
<p>Carefully you twist its spherical handle and push open the heavy oak door just a few inches. Peering around the door, you see a dozen Bhanarian soldiers sitting at a large table set before a blazing log fire. A side of beef is roasting on a spit above this fire, and the soldier’s plates are heaped high with meat and vegetables. Stands of antique armour are positioned around the walls of the hall, and its panelled ceiling is decorated with the portraits of famous Bhanarian generals of old.</p>

<p>‘Wait here, Captain,’ you say to Gildas. ‘I must go to the ravine. I will return soon, I promise.’</p>
<p>And with these words you leave the rangers and make your way to the steep gully where <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> lay concealed before it was attacked. As you approach the ravine, your Kai tracking skills direct you towards a small metallic tube that lies hidden among the boulders.</p>
<p>Hurriedly you scoop up the tube, flip open its hinged lid, and shake a rolled piece of papyrus onto your palm. On this scrap of material is a hastily written message from Rimoah, telling you that the Claw of Naar must not be allowed to fall into the hands of Autarch Sejanoz. He urges you to find and destroy it.</p>
<p><i>If this should prove impossible, you must take it to the city of Pensei. There you should make contact with Lord Ghadra, the Dessian envoy, and he will see to its destruction. He will also help you to return home to Sommerlund.</i></p>
<p>Having memorized its contents, you tear the scrap of papyrus into small pieces and swallow them to ensure that Rimoah’s message will never be discovered by the enemy. Then you return to the mountain pass to rejoin Captain Gildas and his men.</p>
<p>You inform them that Lord Rimoah has been forced to flee in order to save <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> and his crew from the attacking horde. On hearing this they bow their heads in disappointment, fearing that they may never again see Rimoah, or their homeland of Siyen. Then you tell them about the message that Rimoah left behind and, despite their sadness, they each vow to help you capture the Claw of Naar.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ranger Yalin shouts a warning: the flying creatures are returning. Hurriedly you take cover among the rocks and watch as they circle above the pass. Your Kai instincts tell you that these beasts cannot survive for long beyond the mountain borders of the Doomlands, and soon your suspicions are confirmed when you see them returning north to Naaros. When the last of the creatures has disappeared, you beckon Gildas and his men to follow you down onto the mountain trail.

<p>You reach the end of the roof and climb down the trunk of the tree. Gildas and his men follow your lead, and when all of you are safely on the ground, you pause for a few moments to assess the situation. From beneath the leafy boughs of the young oak, you look out across the parade ground and scan the buildings that border upon it. Bhanarian soldiers are running everywhere, seemingly in confusion. Then you realize that they all have a purpose: they are rushing to secure every entrance and exit from the barracks.</p>
<p>Gildas points to a building on the west side of the parade ground. Its doors are open and unguarded. You magnify your vision and see that it is part of the barracks stables. Its well-lit interior is busy with troopers who are preparing their mounts for tomorrow’s ceremonial parade through the city. Beyond its rows of stalls is an archway that opens on to one of the city’s streets. You inform the rangers of what you have seen and you decide that the stables offer you your best hope for an escape from the barracks. Using the perimeter trees for cover, you skirt around the parade ground and make your approach to the stables. You are less than 20 yards from its open doors when you are suddenly called upon to halt. Three Bhanarian guards come weaving through the line of trees towards you, their spears held at the ready. ‘Stay where you are,’ barks the tallest of these soldiers, ‘and all of you—raise your hands!’</p>

It is not until you see the outline of a derelict temple silhouetted on the crest of a ridge that you slow your pace and point your tired horse towards it. Upon reaching the ruined temple you discover that it stands beside a well brim-full with fresh water. You let the horses drink their fill, and as they recover their strength, you and your companions explore the ruin.</p>
<p>The temple is empty and overgrown. Its only feature of note is an altar stone engraved with ancient designs. It is illuminated by a solitary stream of moonlight that filters down through a hole in the shattered slate roof. While the horses are resting, you take the opportunity to examine the Claw and, as you unfold its covering blanket on the altar, you find yourself both fascinated and repulsed by the intricacies of its evil design. The head of the Claw resembles a petrified vulture’s foot, cast in a black metal that is flecked with shimmering scarlet specks. Its shaft is twisted, like a length of gnarled root, and it is perforated along its length with pea-sized hollows.</p>

<p>Captain Gildas consoles you, and from a pocket of his tunic he produces a small crimson gemstone which he cups in his palm, inviting your inspection. Without saying a word, he fixes this gem into one of the hollows in the shaft of the Claw, and then he hands you a seemingly ordinary compass.</p>
<p>‘Look at the compass needle, Sir Kai,’ he says, and he picks up the Claw and begins to walk. As he circles around you, the point of the needle follows his every move.</p>

It’s just a precaution, in case you should be parted from the Claw before you deliver it to the Elder Magi.

<p>For most of the day you ride across a seemingly endless expanse of grassland without once catching sight of the enemy you are pursuing. It is nearly dusk before your keen eyes detect a column of wood smoke on the horizon, rising vertically in the still evening air. You call the rangers to a halt and then magnify your vision to take a closer look at the source of the smoke. It rises from a small copse of trees and you suspect that the enemy have set up a camp there for the night. The smoke tells you that they are cooking food, confident in the false belief that they have safely outdistanced you and your companions.</p>
<p>You inform the others of what you have seen before continuing your ride along the plains road. When you are within a mile of the copse, you leave the trail and dismount. Sergeant Paviz and Ranger Yalin are told to stay and hold the horses while you and the captain go forward to scout the enemy encampment.</p>
<p>Together you crawl towards the copse, side by side, concealed by the approaching darkness and the waist-high grass. You are within 100 yards of the enemy campfire when Gildas makes a sharp intake of breath. You glance at him and your blood freezes when you see that his face is inches from a grey conda—a deadly Bhanarian plains snake. The serpent’s neck is raised and its wedge-shaped head is drawn to strike at your companion’s eyes.</p>

By the time you arrive there, its many lanterns are aglow, and its great log fire is blazing warmly in the grate. The light and heat make for a welcoming arrival, but they give a false impression. Dust lies thickly on the surfaces of every bookshelf, table, and chair. This chamber is well appointed, but it has lain neglected for more than a year.</p>

<p>The man invites you to sit at his table and then he proceeds to shuffle and deal out twelve cards from his deck and place them face up before you. They each feature intricate designs and symbols that you have never seen before. Predictably, he assures you in a syrupy tone that you shall enjoy health, wealth, and great happiness. As he is pointing to the cards, you notice he is wearing a distinctive black signet ring engraved with a tiger’s head. You suspect this man is secretly one of Sejanoz’s agents. When he asks why you have come to Yua Tzhan, Gildas places his hand on your shoulder and suggests that it is time you should be leaving.</p>

<p>You see the fearsome figure of Autarch Sejanoz come stepping through the chamber’s shattered window. He alights from the platform of his golden sky-chariot which hovers silently beside the tower. Sheathed from neck to toe in black and golden armour, this warrior stands an arm’s length taller than you and your companions. A great tiger helm conceals his face and behind him swirls a voluminous scarlet cloak. Only his hands are visible and they seem strangely at odds with the grand scale and design of his armour. They are withered and twisted like claws, the skin wrinkled and cracked like burnt parchment. Hanging over them are four long, curved, needle-like claws of steel that sprout from the back of the golden bracers which encase his wrists.</p>
<p>Gildas and his men reach for their bows and fire repeatedly at the Autarch, yet every arrow they send against him ends shattered. From the visor of his helm there issues a thin, chilling laugh: ‘You cannot kill me with your sharpened sticks, you fools!’ Upon hearing this, Paviz and Yalin drop their bows and unsheathe their blades. Paviz shouts a much practiced cue, and together they attack the Autarch, striking simultaneously from either side.</p>
<p>With stunning swiftness, Sejanoz retaliates. He reaches out and grabs each man by the throat with his cadaverous hands, and raises them several inches from the floor. With a series of metallic clicks, the needle-claws extend and turn inwards, puncturing their jugular veins. Their faces blanch as their blood is drained, and not a drop is spilt.</p>

<p>You observe that the bridge at Zuda is occupied by Bhanarian soldiers. Their tented encampments are dotted around the approach road and river bank, and the line of their supply wagons stretches away to the west.</p>
<p>The tiger’s-head flag of Autarch Sejanoz now flies over Zuda. This border town has been overrun by his army within the last 24 hours. At first you suspect that this could be the start of a war between Bhanar and Chai, but your Kai senses tell you that this is no ordinary military operation.

Having never heard of this edifice, you ask Gildas to explain. ‘The Chai Wall is a line of forts and military defences that lies 60 miles to the east of Zuda,’ he says. ‘Invasion from Bhanar has long been a threat to Chai, but its ancient ruler—Khea-khan Xo—had remarkable foresight. He constructed a formidable wall to deter Autarch Sejanoz from invading his peaceful realm. It has served Chai well for many centuries.’</p>
<p>You thank Gildas for this history lesson, but you question its accuracy. ‘I was taught at the Kai Monastery that the reign of Khea-khan Xo was more than a thousand years ago. Surely his enemy then was not the same Autarch Sejanoz who rules Bhanar now?’</p>
<p>‘Ah, but he is!’ replies Gildas. ‘Sejanoz has ruled this land for 3,000 years. Legend says that he entered into a pact with Agarash the Damned. In return for his soul he received…immortality.’</p>

<p>You retreat before the advancing Imperial Guardsmen until your backs are pressed against the base of the crimson tower. Gildas calls for you to look behind, and when you glance over your shoulder, you see that there is a red door set flush into the tower wall. Forcefully you push the door but it will not open. Then you notice a dial set in the middle of its surface, and in the centre of the dial is a small keyhole. The rangers load their bows and fire repeatedly at the advancing guardsmen as you attempt to unlock the door to the crimson tower.</p>
<p>The dial is surrounded by numerals numbering from 0 to 100. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you determine that by turning the dial to one of these numbers, you will cause the lock to disengage and the door will open.</p>
<p>While examining the dial, you recall the wall safe in the barracks at Yua Tzhan. That lock required 3 digits to open it. This requires only one. The number that will open this lock is equal to the total you get when you add together the three digits that opened the wall safe.</p>

<p>Thinking that you are provisioners from one of the other wagons, the driver is glad to accept your offer to help gather up the vegetables that lie strewn across the paved street. The raised hoods of your robes help keep your faces in shadow, and he fails to recognize that you are not native Bhanarians. Then one of the iron doors in the northern wall creaks open, and a barracks guard barks an order to the waiting drivers to begin delivering their loads by hand. A collective groan arises from the line of parked wagons, but for you and your companions it proves to be a perfect opportunity to enter the barracks undetected.</p>
<p>Each of you takes a box of provisions from the rear of the wagon and joins in the line of drivers as they file through the iron door. You follow this line to a kitchen store room, located near the middle of the barracks complex, where you deposit your delivery and then return to the street to collect another box. As you are making your way back, you pass a door that your Kai senses tell you is unlocked. Quickly you slip inside and then signal to your companions to follow.

<p>You are dismayed that your attempt to destroy the Claw has failed, yet you refuse to abandon all hope of ridding your world of this evil artefact. You resolve to deliver it to the Elder Magi, for you know that it is within their power to obliterate this weapon of darkness.</p>
<p>Captain Gildas consoles you, and from a pocket of his tunic he produces a small crimson gemstone which he cups in his palm, inviting your inspection. Without saying a word, he fixes this gem into one of the hollows in the shaft of the Claw, and then he hands you a seemingly ordinary compass.</p>
<p>‘Look at the compass needle, Sir Kai,’ he says, and he picks up the Claw and begins to walk. As he circles around you, the point of the needle follows his every move.</p>
<p>‘It’s a Siyenese tracker-gem,’ he says. ‘The needle of the compass is tuned to its vibrations. It’s just a precaution, in case you should be parted from the Claw before you deliver it to the Elder Magi. So long as the gem remains embedded in its shaft, you’ll be able to track it using the compass.’ Gildas hands you the Claw and you compliment him for his prudence.</p>
<p>‘A very wise precaution, Captain,’ you say, as you slip the compass into your tunic pocket. ‘Somehow I feel sure that we have not yet seen the last of the Autarch’s squad.’</p>

Four of their number lie dead or wounded on the ground, hit by ranger arrows. Your companions are putting up a brave fight, but they face the danger of being surrounded on both sides and trapped in the corridor.</p>
<p>Then a new threat to their survival arrives. Three Bhanarian guards enter the hall pushing a strange, cannon-like contraption towards the distant archway. Fixed above its barrel is a large iron cylinder. It is studded with heavy rivets and fitted with a springed valve that bubbles and hisses like an angry serpent. You surmise this device is a steam-powered cannon, and you fear that if it is fired along the corridor it could slay your companions with one blast. As the Bhanarian gunners begin loading their weapon with handfuls of rusty nails and lead shot, you know you must find some way to stop them from firing this devilish device.</p>

You let the horses drink their fill and, as they recover their strength, you and your companions explore the lower levels of the ruin.</p>
<p>The tower is empty and overgrown with weeds. All that it contains are several blocks of stone engraved with ancient designs, which are illuminated by streams of moonlight filtering down through the holes in the shattered roof. You take the opportunity to examine the Claw, and as you unfold its covering blanket on one of the blocks, you find yourself both fascinated and repulsed by the intricacies of its evil design. The head of the Claw resembles a petrified vulture’s foot, cast in a black metal that is flecked with shimmering scarlet specks. Its shaft is twisted, like a length of gnarled root, and it is perforated along its length with pea-sized hollows.</p>
<p>A palpable evil radiates from this dread artefact and you feel an overwhelming compulsion to destroy it. You tell the rangers to stand clear, and then you unsheathe your Kai Weapon and deal the shaft of the Claw a mighty blow.</p>

<p>By twisting the dial of the wall safe to an incorrect setting you unwittingly set off an alarm in a distant barracks guardroom. Suddenly the door to the antechamber is forced open and in burst a dozen soldiers, armed with spears and axes.</p>
<p>You draw your Kai Weapon and fight bravely, slaying most who dare come within a sword’s length, but the chamber is soon awash with reinforcements and ultimately you are forced to drop your weapons and surrender. During the mêlée, the rangers are also captured, and together you are taken before the Sergeant of the Guard. Upon learning of the death of the squad leader, he denounces you as assassins and he orders your immediate execution.</p>
<p>Under heavy guard, you are led out into the centre of the barracks parade ground and tied to wooden stakes. A troop of crossbowmen arrive and form up in a line before you. Then the sergeant marches to the head of their line, and promptly he gives the order to fire. The crossbowmen release their volley of deadly missiles and your deaths are mercifully swift.</p>

It leads you towards the Military Quarter located on the east side of the square. You follow a broad avenue lined with closed shop doorways and soon arrive at a busy barracks.

When you do not obey his command immediately, one of the bridge guards steps out of the line and jabs Captain Gildas in the ribs with the haft of his spear.

<p>Beyond the door you discover a narrow passage that leads to a flight of stone steps. You check your Siyenese Compass and then you lead the rangers up the stairs to a wider corridor on the floor above.</p>
<p>You instruct Gildas and his men to wait at the top of the stairs while you make sure the way ahead is clear. Tall arched windows march past on either side as you approach a door at the end of the passageway. You detect the aroma of roasting meat and hear the sounds of feasting, and when you peep through the door’s keyhole, you see a soldiers’ mess hall beyond.</p>
<p>Carefully you twist its spherical handle and push open the heavy oak door just a few inches. Peering around the door, you see a dozen Bhanarian soldiers sitting at a large table set before a blazing log fire. A side of beef is roasting on a spit above this fire, and the soldier’s plates are heaped high with meat and vegetables. Stands of antique armour are positioned around the walls of the hall, and its panelled ceiling is decorated with the portraits of famous Bhanarian generals of old.</p>
<p>Some of the soldiers dining here are Imperial Guards from the squad that you encountered in Sunderer Pass. You scrutinise their faces, yet you cannot see their leader among them. Your Siyenese Compass indicates that the Claw of Naar is nearby; its needle is pointing to a door on the far side of the mess hall. You sense that the Claw is in the room beyond this door, and you resolve to find a way of reaching it without being seen.</p>

<p>Using the shadows to conceal your approach, you climb over the tailgate of a canvas-covered wagon that is standing in the line, and hide yourselves among its load. Patiently you settle down and wait for it to enter the barracks. Several minutes pass before the wagon begins to move. You tear a hole in its canvas cover through which you are able to see the inner buildings of the barracks complex. The wagon trundles along a narrow passage towards a parade square, beyond which lies its final destination—the kitchen store rooms.

<p>You watch with mounting fear as the horde of winged creatures circle and dive repeatedly into the ravine. They are met by intermittent flashes of magical energy which illuminate the gloom; Lord Rimoah and his young crewmen are putting up a spirited defence of their grounded skyship.</p>
<p>Then you see an unexpected sight: <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> rises out of the gully and ascends rapidly into the darkening sky. You magnify your vision and witness a bloody battle raging along her decks as the winged beasts attempt to wrest control of the helm. You watch helplessly as the beleaguered skyship powers away towards the east, pursued by the flying swarm of ravening beasts.</p>

It is the Claw of Naar, and even at a distance its malignant power fills you with unease and foreboding.</p>
<p>With bated breath, you watch the Autarch’s men come marching along the narrow trail. Captain Gildas gives the signal to Durasso to spring the ambush, and the ranger tugs hard on the rope in his hands. There is a moment of silence; then a thunderous rumble reverberates through the mountains. A billowing cloud of thick dust engulfs the trail and you lose sight of the squad as a thousand tons of rock and rubble cascade towards them.</p>

<p>You take the opportunity to get some sleep while the storm continues unabated. Gildas wakes you shortly after dawn and you peer out of the cottage window to see that the rain is now no more than a fine drizzle. You mount up and return to the road, but soon you discover that the way south is impassable. The road has been blocked during the night by the debris of a torrential mudslide.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, you are forced to abandon your horses and set off across the hills on foot. During your trek, you discard your plains-herder robes for they offer no protection from the rain. At noon you halt to prepare a meal of roots and wild vegetables. While you are eating, you resolve to attempt to cross the River Heng and enter the friendly realm of Chai. Once you are across the border, you will make your way to the city of Pensei, and try to make contact with the Dessian envoy—Lord Ghadra.</p>
<p>Despite difficult terrain you make good progress. You leave the Honah Hills and enter the dark pines of the Angfeng Forest, covering 30 miles by sunset.

<p>Your Arrow strikes the cannon’s pressure cylinder, but it fails to penetrate the thick iron skin and it ricochets away. Your failed attempt to destroy the cannon betrays your presence, and a handful of the Bhanarians leave the fight at the archway and come running towards the antechamber with their swords and axes raised to strike.</p>
<p>You shoulder your Bow and offer up a short prayer to Ishir to protect you as you get ready to meet their determined attack. With your battle-cry upon your lips, you pull open the door and flail your Kai Weapon at the first Bhanarian who comes within striking distance.</p>

<p>‘Come, brave rangers. We must pursue the enemy without delay,’ you plead, in an effort to rally your exhausted companions. ‘They must not be allowed to steal away the Claw.’</p>
<p>‘Hold, Sir Kai,’ retorts Captain Gildas. ‘The enemy is too strong. They outnumber us, and they possess a weapon that can slay us all but with one bolt. Do you not recall what happened at Sunderer Pass? I have lost one good man already. I have no desire to risk any more in a reckless pursuit.’</p>
<p>‘Are you breaking your vow to help me, captain?’ you ask, reproachfully.</p>
<p>‘No, Sir Kai,’ he retorts. ‘My vow remains true. I simply propose we pursue the enemy at a safe distance. They may run with the Claw of Naar, but they cannot keep it from us forever. The tracker-gem that I’ve placed in the haft will always lead us to it, no matter where it may be hidden.’</p>

All three cross the river safely, and together you approach Zuda under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>The road into the town is heavily patrolled by Bhanarian soldiers. When you nearly collide with one of these patrols, you are forced to seek cover in an empty woodcutter’s hut.</p>

<p>You halt beside the wrecked wagon and use your Animal Mastery to converse with the belligerent bird. To your surprise, you discover that the crow is not angry at all—he is trying to warn you. You learn that the forest is dominated by an evil shape-changer that feeds on human blood. The bird tells you that it has claimed many victims, including the poor souls who once ventured here long ago in this wagon.

<p>Beyond the entrance is a courtyard where several wagons, filled with provisions, are being unloaded. You and your companions each take a box from the rear of the nearest wagon and join a line of men who are delivering their goods to a kitchen store room located near the middle of the barracks complex. You leave your boxes here and then return to the courtyard to collect some more. As you are making your way back, you pass a door that your Kai senses tell you is unlocked.

<p>Above the narrowest section of the mountain pass, the rangers have rigged a great wooden platform heaped with boulders and rocks. A length of rope has been tied to a prop which supports this platform, and it trails back to a hiding place overlooking the pass. ‘One pull on this rope,’ says Sergeant Paviz, flashing a wicked grin, ‘and the whole lot’ll come tumblin’ down on their heads!’</p>
<p>Captain Gildas tells you that the enemy squad is expected to traverse the pass before nightfall. He posts Ranger Durasso as lookout atop a high peak, and while you wait for the enemy to show, you pass the time in conversation with the captain.</p>
<p>Slowly the sun sets beyond the western horizon and a blanket of cloud rolls across the sky from the north, bringing with it a chill night wind. Then you hear Durasso whistling: it is the signal that the enemy have been sighted. Quickly you look down into the pass below and notice a group of dark figures moving along the mountain track.</p>

<p>Cautiously you continue your approach towards the enemy encampment. Upon reaching the edge of the copse, you catch sight of the Imperial Guards gathered around a campfire. They are eating the remnants of a roasted fanji, and their horses are tethered by silken ropes to the bough of a chestnut tree some distance away from the crackling fire. A few of the warriors are already asleep, including their leader. You observe him carefully and your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that the Claw of Naar is wrapped in the blanket roll he is using as a pillow. Having committed the details of the encampment to memory, you signal to Captain Gildas to follow as silently you slip away and return to your waiting companions.</p>

<p>Your refusal angers the Autarch.</p>
<p>You sense a sudden surge of psychic power, and you brace your mental defences in preparation to meet an expected attack. The Autarch launches a stream of psychic pulses but they are not directed at you; Captain Gildas is the target.</p>
<p>Gildas shudders as the pulses impact deep in his mind. His eyes open widely, but his pupils rise to the ceiling. He is in a trance. He draws his sword and, like a mindless automaton, he swings around and comes marching stiffly towards you. You shout his name repeatedly, but all he can hear are the Autarch’s psychic commands to attack and slay you with his sword.</p>
<p>At first his blows are clumsy and easy to dodge, but the speed of his movements increases until you are backed against the chamber wall with nowhere to go. You have no desire to fight Gildas, but he will slay you unwittingly if you do not defend yourself from his relentless blows.</p>

<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense warns you that the one-eyed man and his cohorts are waiting outside in the main square. They are determined to ambush you and your companions the moment you step from the inn. Wary of their intentions, you ask the innkeeper if there is another exit from the taproom and he points to a curtained archway. It conceals a door which opens on to an alleyway running alongside the inn. You leave by this door and walk to the end of the alley, taking care to avoid the main square. Your mind is now focused upon the task of finding and retrieving the Claw of Naar before Autarch Sejanoz arrives, and when you consult your Siyenese Compass, you set off in the direction it indicates. It leads you towards the Military Quarter of the city, located on the east side of the main square. You follow an avenue lined with closed shop doorways, and soon you arrive at a busy barracks. The Siyenese Compass and your Kai Sixth Sense both tell you that the Claw of Naar is located somewhere inside this troop-infested building.</p>

At first the spongy ground comes as a welcome relief after the jagged rocks and twisted roots that litter the floor of the Angfeng Forest. Then the marshy soil degenerates into a treacherous swamp, and soon you are forced to head south in search of firmer terrain.</p>
<p>For two days and nights you trek across wetlands, living as best you can off the flora and fauna of this inhospitable region. By noon of the third day you catch sight of a stone bridge across the River Heng, on the outskirts of a town called Zuda. The rangers are excited at the prospect of escaping at last from the mosquito-infested wetlands, but their enthusiasm is dampened when you magnify your vision and take a closer look at this Chai border town.</p>

Suddenly there is a vivid flash of blue-white light when one of the Imperial Guards brushes past the column of stone in the middle of the track. You let out a cheer when you see the leading riders tumble from their saddles, and your companions echo your cry when you tell them what you have witnessed.</p>

<p>The old man is deeply hurt by your refusal to take bread and wine with him. It is considered a grave insult in Bhanar to refuse such basic hospitality. Some of the young men who have gathered outside the tent to watch you now begin to reach for their daggers. Anxious to avoid any needless bloodshed, Captain Gildas intervenes and accepts the old man’s offer on your behalf. ‘He’s a Northlander,’ he says, by way of an apology on your behalf. ‘He knows nothing of your customs.’</p>
<p>The old man smiles and nods his head, and then he invites you all to come into his tent. You dismount, and the children look after your horses while you file into his spacious dwelling. He gives each of you a glass of mulled wine and a piece of unleavened bread, and while you are enjoying this plain fare, he invites you to examine the wares and trinkets which lie strewn about his tent.</p>
<p>Gildas nudges you and points to a rickety table that is heaped with simple straw-coloured robes, much favoured by Bhanarian plainsmen. ‘These may be a wise investment, Sir Kai?’ he mutters. ‘I fear our tunics may arouse suspicion the further south we venture.’</p>
<p>You nod in agreement and ask the old man how much he wants for four of his robes.</p>
<p>‘One hundred and sixty Ren, kind sir,’ he replies, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Sejanoz approaches the fire and stoops to retrieve the Claw, but then he hesitates. His skeletal hand trembles and he seems powerless to control it. You sense that he is afraid of the flames: it is his one vital weakness.</p>
<p>You rush towards him and land a kick to his side, toppling him over. Before he can rise again, you grab the haft of the Claw and tug it from the fire. A burning log is skewered upon its tip. It flares brightly when you thrust it at the Autarch’s helm and he rolls away, towards the shattered window. You follow up and jab it at his hands, and he shrieks with fear. Then he tries to stand, and as he is levering himself up from the floor, you leap into the air and land a two-footed kick to his chest that sends him somersaulting backwards. With a wailing cry, he tumbles out of the window and plummets into the courtyard below.</p>

As you approach the ravine, you hear the sounds of fierce fighting and see intermittent flashes of magical energy piercing the gloom. The winged horde are making a determined attack upon the grounded skyship, but Lord Rimoah and his young crewmen are putting up a spirited defence.</p>

He hurls a metallic tube in your direction and you hear his voice in your mind, urging you to retrieve it. Then the link is broken when he is forced to defend himself from a determined attacker. You watch the tube strike a rock at the edge of the ravine, and then it disappears from sight. With fear running cold in your veins, you watch helplessly as the beleaguered skyship powers away towards the east, pursued by the flying swarm of ravening beasts.</p>
