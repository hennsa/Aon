 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>This exciting mini-adventure first appeared in <cite>The Magnamund Companion</cite>. You are Banedon, a journeyman for the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, Sommerlund’s Guild of Magicians. You have been given an urgent mission—to travel from the city of Toran to the Kai Monastery and deliver a letter of grave importance. Your failure could spell doom for your guild, your country, and maybe even the entire world.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


     <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="42" width="386" src="small2.png" /><br /><br /></div><p>You are Banedon, a young Journeyman to the Magicians’ Guild of Toran in Sommerlund. In the last two weeks disturbing events have rocked the stability of your guild. A brother magician named Vonotar denounced the Guild and murdered one of the Elders. He disappeared after the crime and your Guildmaster fears that he has fled to Helgedad to aid the Darklords.</p>
<p>It is now dawn of the day before the feast of Fehmarn. You have been summoned to the Guildmaster’s chamber and entrusted with an envelope that must be taken to the Monastery of the Kai. It contains an urgent message for the Kai Grand Master, and your mission is to deliver it by hand at all costs. The Guildmaster warns you to be on your guard at all times, for he fears that enemy agents are already at work within the land. ‘Travel swiftly, my son,’ he says, as you turn to leave his chamber, ‘and may the luck of the gods go with you.’</p>
</div><div class="frontmatter">
<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Before you start you must determine your fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>) and physical stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>). To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> on the last page of this book. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to this number and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat, or if you use certain spells, you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<h3><a name="powers">Magical Powers</a></h3>

<h4><a name="mksumary">Magical Powers</a></h4>

<p>You have mastered only <em>five</em> of the ten spells that the Magicians’ Guild call the ‘Brotherhood Spells’.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five spells, enter them in the ‘Brotherhood Spells’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="lightng">Lightning Hand</a></h5>

<p>This spell enables you to cast a bolt of lightning, simply by pointing a finger and concentrating upon the spell. Every time this spell is used you must deduct 3 from your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total.</p>
<h5><a name="mndcharm">Mind Charm</a></h5>

<p>Casting this spell upon a person (or creature) will cause that person to regard you as a trusted friend. It will not allow you to control the person, but anything you do or say will be looked on as friendly.</p>
<h5><a name="invsshld">Invisible Shield</a></h5>

<p>When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier will form as protection from missiles and enemies. However, it will not protect you from magical attacks, and every time it is used you must deduct 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points from your score.</p>
<h5><a name="net">Net</a></h5>

<p>This spell enables you to cast a web-like net of magical rope at a chosen target. It can be used to ensnare an enemy, or to enable you to climb high walls or obstacles with ease.</p>
<h5><a name="vigour">Vigour</a></h5>

<p>Casting this spell will increase your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 3 points for the duration of one combat, at the cost of 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. It cannot be used if your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total is below 10.</p>
<h5><a name="countspl">Counterspell</a></h5>

<p>This spell may be used to protect yourself, or another person or object of your choice, from a magical attack. Use of this spell costs 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<h5><a name="levitn">Levitation</a></h5>

<p>This spell may be cast upon yourself, or upon another person or object, to cancel the effects of gravity, and thereby make the affected object rise into the air. The spell lasts no more than a few minutes and its usage costs 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<h5><a name="sensevil">Sense Evil</a></h5>

<p>When this spell is cast it will enable you to detect the presence of evil in any creature or object close by. However, perils such as traps or naturally poisonous animals will not be detected through the use of this spell.</p>
<h5><a name="mend">Mend</a></h5>

<p>This spell can be used to repair damaged items or to restore lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. In order for the spell to work, you must be standing in fresh running water, such as a river or stream, when the spell is cast. Using this spell upon yourself will restore 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<h5><a name="silence">Silence</a></h5>

<p>Casting this spell will muffle the sound of any movement that you make.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>You wear a Crystal Star Pendant (Special Item). Before leaving the Guildhall, you are given an Envelope that contains the Guildmaster’s message to the Kai (Special Item), and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to this number. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may now enter this number in the Gold Crowns section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. The message is carried inside your robe, and you are given a backpack in which to carry any four of the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blanket (Backpack Item)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Healing potion (Backpack Item) This potion restores 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Rope (Backpack Item)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Torch (Backpack Item)<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="69" width="386" src="small1.png" /><br /><br /></div></li>
<li>2 Meals (Backpack Items) Each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Tinderbox (Backpack Item)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bottle of Wine (Backpack Item)<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>You also possess a Short Sword (Weapon) which you carry in a scabbard.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">Using Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>If you enter a combat with no Weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a Weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. The maximum number of Weapons that you may carry is two.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">1</a></sup><br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>You may discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat. Your Backpack can carry a maximum of eight articles (including Meals).<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are carried in your pouch (maximum 50 Crowns).<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Each Meal counts as one backpack item. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Your aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through the use of Special Items or spells to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>When you have your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Banedon and his adversary in this round of combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to both participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from Stage 3.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Banedon are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Banedon is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Banedon proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Banedon may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may evade only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="200" width="772" src="ill1.png" /><br /><strong>Illustration I</strong>—It is now dawn on the day before the feast of Fehmarn.
<br /><br /></div><p>A sense of foreboding hangs over you as you mount your horse and head towards the city’s south gate. There, a couple of tired night guards grumble wearily at your demand for the gate to be opened.</p>
<p>‘What’s the hurry?’ they growl. The door finally opens and you gallop through the arch.</p>
<p>Half a mile beyond a stone bridge you see a signpost. An arrow pointing to the south says, ‘Meadowood ½ mile/Holmgard 80 miles’, and the other arrow, pointing west says simply, ‘Old Mine Road’.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue south along the highway, <a href="#sect7">turn to 7</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to take the road heading west, <a href="#sect55">turn to 55</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>Shouting your power-word, you point at the snarling Giaks. The lightning bolt breaks into several smaller energy pulses that rip into the evil warriors, sending them tumbling in all directions. Seizing the opportunity, you turn and run deeper into the ruined temple.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect32">Turn to 32</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect3">3</a></h3>

<p>Reining your horse to a halt, you stare down at the two dead Rangers. Their chests are scorched as if they were both struck by lightning. A Sword and a Mace lie close by. You may take either of these weapons.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect31">Turn to 31</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>The one-roomed hut is damp and deserted. You scan the moss-covered walls for a good hiding place and your attention is caught by a large stone fireplace. You waste no time in climbing up the flue. Minutes later you hear the Giaks enter the hut in search of you. You try to keep as still as possible but you are desperate to sneeze.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the spell <i>Silence</i> and wish to use it, <a href="#sect74">turn to 74</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this spell, <a href="#sect22">turn to 22</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>A search of the cupboards uncovers 2 Gold Crowns, enough food for one Meal, and the old man’s Silver Warhammer. If you wish to take this, mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry tucked into your belt.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect15">Turn to 15</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>‘Quickly, take cover in the forest,’ you shout to Daron and Thelda. But their little pony is terrified by the black-winged Kraan. It panics and gallops off into the trees on the other side of the highway. You are forced to ride deeper into the forest to avoid the black arrows of their Giak riders.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect73">Turn to 73</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>A few minutes later you see a line of wagons on the highway ahead. A group of merchants are arguing with a patrol of Border Rangers who stand guard at a barricade. The Rangers are refusing to allow anyone to pass through the village of Meadowood. ‘No good you trying,’ calls a disgruntled coachman.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ask the Rangers to allow you through, <a href="#sect48">turn to 48</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stop and talk to the coachman, <a href="#sect57">turn to 57</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>You cast your spell and catch all three of them by surprise. They struggle to free themselves but to no avail. The Kraan, fearing its riders have fallen into the clutches of a hideous monster, flies away to avoid a similar fate. The path is now clear and you seize your chance of escape.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect47">Turn to 47</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect9">9</a></h3>

<p>Suddenly, a wave of pain makes you scream out. Two arrows have passed through your chest and back, smashing the air from your lungs. You fall from the saddle, crashing to the soft earth with a terrible jolt.</p>
<p>The last thing you hear are gasps of horror as the Rangers recognize your sky-blue robes.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your mission end here.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect10">10</a></h3>

<p>As night falls, you reach the tiny village of Oak Hill, less than twenty miles from the Monastery of the Kai. There is no tavern here, but the blacksmith is well known for his generous hospitality.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stop at the blacksmith’s house, <a href="#sect66">turn to 66</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to sleep out in the open, <a href="#sect79">turn to 79</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect11">11</a></h3>

<p>For over an hour you move stealthily through the trees, straining for the sound of an approaching Giak patrol or nearby Kraan.</p>
<p>Gradually the trees begin to thin out and you can see the ruins of an ancient temple. You take refuge beneath a fallen pillar. As you catch your breath, you remove the Guildmaster’s Envelope from your robe. Now that war has begun, it will be safer to commit its contents to memory rather than allow it to fall into enemy hands.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect42">Turn to 42</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect12">12</a></h3>

<p>As you rush into the fray, the familiar sound of Kraan wings return. Hovering above you are six of the fearsome creatures. The peasants panic and flee, leaving you to face the Kraan alone.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stand and fight, <a href="#sect37">turn to 37</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to escape, <a href="#sect59">turn to 59</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect13">13</a></h3>

<p>Hurriedly, you cast the spell, circling your palm behind your head to form the shield. An instant later, two arrows just miss your back. Your magic has saved your life, but it has not protected you from a third arrow that gouges your left leg. Lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Wincing with pain, you press on until you have left the archers far behind.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect15">Turn to 15</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect14">14</a></h3>

<p>You soon learn that your companions’ names are Daron and Thelda, and that their father owns a bakery at Searsby.</p>
<p>An hour has passed when you hear the beat of huge wings. A great cloud of black-winged creatures appears flying in a vast formation that darkens the sky. Your heart sinks. The Darklords, the ancient enemy of your people, are attacking. War has begun.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue along the highway, <a href="#sect49">turn to 49</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to seek the shelter of the forest, <a href="#sect6">turn to 6</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect15">15</a></h3>

<p>The track continues for several miles down a steep wooded hillside to arrive at a little bridge spanning a deep, crystal-clear stream. A young woman dressed in padded leather armour stands there, warily watching you approach.</p>
<p>‘Where are you bound for, young wizard?’ she asks.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to tell her your destination, <a href="#sect54">turn to 54</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you demand that she allow you across the bridge, <a href="#sect76">turn to 76</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect16">16</a></h3>

<p>The Giaks form a semicircle, holding you at bay with the points of their spears. Suddenly, a clutch of Kraan glides across the trees and drop their riders almost on top of you. Their leader screams <i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Darg!’</i> and, as one, the Giaks charge.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect37">Turn to 37</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect17">17</a></h3>

<p>As you whisper the spell-chant, a wave of fear numbs your senses.</p>
<p>You are in the presence of a great and malicious evil. The woman senses your fear and a smile spreads across her face.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect54">Turn to 54</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect18">18</a></h3>

<p>Your quick thinking saves you from the full impact of the lightning bolt. It passes close by your head, blistering the skin on your cheek and causing your hair to smoulder. The Helghast screams a terrible cry that claws at your mind (lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), but the pain quickly fades as you gallop away from the village.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect46">Turn to 46</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect19">19</a></h3>

<p>As you leave your hiding place, a cry echoes in your ears. <i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Orgadak—Dok taag!’</i> You thrust the Envelope back into your robes and clamber across the ruins. Giaks appear as if from nowhere; one has his arm drawn back ready to throw a spear.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the spell <i>Lightning Hand</i> and wish to use it, <a href="#sect2">turn to 2</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to dodge the spear, <a href="#sect51">turn to 51</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect20">20</a></h3>

<p>Three hours pass before a Drakkarim officer appears at the edge of the pit and stares down at you with contempt. He barks an order and a circle of Giak archers appear. The last thing you hear is the hiss of their deadly black arrows.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your mission end here.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect66">66</a></h3>

<p>You knock on the door of the blacksmithy. It opens and a small plump woman stands before you, hurriedly wiping her hands on her chequered apron. She smiles and calls for Tym, her husband, as she ushers you into the dark warmth of the smithy. Tym the blacksmith welcomes you with a firm handshake. ‘My word, Petrea, we’re honoured to have a journeyman with us tonight,’ he says to his wife.</p>
<p>You enjoy a delicious supper, during which the blacksmith asks a favour of you. His nephew and niece, who are staying at the blacksmithy, are due to return home to their village in the morning. They live in Searsby, which lies to the south, where the road to the Kai Monastery branches off from the main highway. All he asks is that you accompany them home. You can hardly refuse the blacksmith’s request, especially after enjoying his food and hospitality.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect36">Turn to 36</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect67">67</a></h3>

<p>You dismount and tether your horse before climbing the rickety steps to the cabin door. Through a cracked window pane you can see an old man sitting in a rocking chair. He is smoking a clay pipe and reading a leather-bound book. As you approach the door, you tread on a twig that snaps with a loud crack.</p>
<p>‘Who’s there?’ calls the old man.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter the cabin, <a href="#sect33">turn to 33</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to press on through the forest, <a href="#sect15">turn to 15</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect68">68</a></h3>

<p>Cautiously you move through the enemy-infested trees, but less than a hundred yards from the water’s edge you are spotted by a Kraan patrol. You cannot evade them.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect37">Turn to 37</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect69">69</a></h3>

<p>You weave back and forth across the track, to present the archers with a harder target. Your tactics pay off, for although an arrow grazes your scalp (lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point), it is just a flesh wound. Wiping a trickle of blood away, you press on and soon leave the archers cursing your escape.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect15">Turn to 15</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect70">70</a></h3>

<p>Crashing headlong through the bracken, you fight to stay on your feet as you make your escape. Everywhere you hear the cries of Kraan and Giaks echoing through the trees. After ten minutes, the trees start to thin out and you can just make out the shape of a stone hut nestling at the bottom of a shallow ravine.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to hide in this hut, <a href="#sect4">turn to 4</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to push on deeper into the forest, <a href="#sect45">turn to 45</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect71">71</a></h3>

<p>You ask her once more to let you cross, this time using your spell <i>Mind Charm</i> to persuade her you are friendly. Unfortunately, your spell does not have the desired effect.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect54">Turn to 54</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect72">72</a></h3>

<p>The energy bolt smashes into your unprotected chest and hurls you out of the saddle. Your chest is ablaze and tongues of orange flame flicker before your eyes—but you feel no pain. Only numbness and the irresistible urge to sleep fill your body. As your eyes slowly close, you do not see the Helghast raise its black staff to finish you off.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your mission end here.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect73">73</a></h3>

<p>Your heart is pounding fit to burst as you urge your horse through the ever-thickening foliage. The forest soon becomes too dense to continue on horseback and you are forced to press on by foot. You force your way through the rich vegetation until you discover a track. To the north you can make out some huts; to the south the path disappears into wooded hills.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to head north towards the huts, <a href="#sect21">turn to 21</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go south towards the hills, <a href="#sect47">turn to 47</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect74">74</a></h3>

<p>You invoke the spell just in time, and your violent sneezing goes undetected by the Giak soldiers searching the hut below. You wait several minutes before leaving your hiding place and pushing on through the forest to the south.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect45">Turn to 45</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect75">75</a></h3>

<p><sup><a href="#sect75-1-foot" name="sect75-1">3</a></sup>Under the influence of your magic, a calm descends on the man and his anger is swiftly replaced by his usual jollity. ‘I’m sorry,’ he says. ‘Please forgive my rudeness. I don’t know what came over me.’</p>
<p>He ushers you to a table near the fireplace that is set for dinner, and calls to his son to prepare you a meal. The food is delicious: restore 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total before leaving the tavern and continuing on your way.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect7">Turn to 7</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect76">76</a></h3>

<p>She answers by grasping the hilt of a weapon sheathed at her side. Her expression is stern and unfriendly.</p>

<p>To the surprise of his men, the captain orders the barricade to be drawn aside. You are allowed to pass, but as you are riding towards the village, you hear the captain shouting: ‘Stop that rider!’</p>
<p>Your spell has begun to wear off. Spurring your horse to a gallop, you race along the deserted main street of Meadowood. Two bloodstained bodies lie on the road ahead; they are Rangers and they appear to be dead.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stop and examine the bodies, <a href="#sect3">turn to 3</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to ride on as fast as you can, <a href="#sect31">turn to 31</a>.</p>

<p>One of your fellow captives, a young hill farmer, unties the cords that bind your wrists. With your hands free once more, you whisper the spell <i>Levitation</i> and slowly rise to the edge of the pit. The others are amazed but they stay silent so as not to jeopardize your escape. Patiently you wait for the right moment before emerging from the pit and diving into the cover of the trees.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect11">Turn to 11</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect79">79</a></h3>

<p>You awake shortly after dawn to a chill morning and, unless you possess a Blanket, you must deduct 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. You are rising to your feet when suddenly you realize you are being watched. Two children, a boy and a girl, are sitting astride a little black pony, staring at you in disbelief.</p>
<p>‘Have you been asleep here all night?’ asks the young girl. You nod.</p>
<p>‘You should have called on our uncle,’ says the boy. ‘He’s the blacksmith of Oak Hill. He would have given you a bed for the night.’</p>
<p>The little girl leans forward and offers you some bread and cheese. Gratefully you accept her kind offer (restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point).</p>
<p>‘We’re on our way to Searsby for the feast of Fehmarn,’ says her brother. ‘Are you going that way?’</p>
<p>The village of Searsby lies to the south, where a road to the Kai Monastery branches off from the main highway.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the spell <i>Sense Evil</i> and wish to use it, <a href="#sect30">turn to 30</a>.</p>

<p>You offer your hand in friendship and it is gratefully received. After introducing yourself, you hand over the Guildmaster’s Envelope. The Kai Lord studies the message and a great sadness fills his eagle eyes.</p>
<p>‘Alas, the wisdom of this warning has arrived too late to save my kin. The war has already begun and my brothers in arms were the first to fall to the evil host of Helgedad. They are dead, and I am all that remains of the Kai. Your mission is complete, Banedon, but mine has only just begun. I, Lone Wolf, must journey to Holmgard to warn the King. He will know what must be done to save our land.’</p>
<p>Instinctively, you remove your Crystal Star Pendant and hand it to the last Kai warrior. It is a talisman of good luck and you pray that it protects him on the perilous road ahead.</p>
<p>Your mission is complete!</p>
