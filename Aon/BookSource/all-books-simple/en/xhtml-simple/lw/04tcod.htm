<div class="frontmatter">

  <p>You are Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords. To the south of your homeland of Sommerlund lies the rich but remote mining province of Ruanon. When a regular shipment of gold suddenly vanishes, the King dispatches a patrol of his best cavalry to investigate the suspected theft. They do not return.</p>

  <p>In <strong><cite>The Chasm of Doom</cite></strong>, you are sent to recover the missing gold and locate the lost patrol, but you soon discover that it is a mission of direful consequence—for the fate of your country is at stake!</p>

 
     <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


    <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>Ruanon is a remote mining province to the south of your homeland, Sommerlund. Nestling between the sullen peaks of the Durncrag and Maaken mountains, the people of this province have long prospered from their toil in the ore-rich mines, living and enjoying their wealth under the protection of their lord—Baron Vanalund.</p>
<p>The gold and gems that are mined at Ruanon yield an important source of revenue to your homeland. The heavily guarded convoy of wagons that leave the province and journey to the capital has become a regular monthly routine; a routine that had never been broken until one month ago when, suddenly, all contact with Ruanon ceased. A troop of one hundred cavalry from the King’s Guard were immediately dispatched to investigate the whereabouts of the missing convoy. Their commanding officer, Captain D’Val, was ordered to report back to the King as soon as contact was made, but he and his men have not returned: they too have disappeared without trace.</p>
<p>The King has summoned you, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords, to his citadel at Holmgard. Your quest is to find Captain D’Val and his men, discover what has happened to the missing convoy, and to uncover the veil of mystery that now hangs over Ruanon. The King has gathered a company of Border Rangers, a unit of élite scouts, all of whom are skilled in horsemanship and outdoor survival. He has ordered these fifty men to accompany you in the hope that, with your leadership, they may succeed where the larger and more visible force failed.</p>
<p>As you and your men enter the Royal Armoury to equip yourselves for the long ride ahead, you glimpse a black crow perched on a window ledge high above. It flies away, but not before a shiver has run down your spine: in Holmgard, the crow is a bird of ill omen.</p>
</div><div class="frontmatter">
<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, and Kai Disciplines which you can now carry over with you to Book 4. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You may choose one bonus <a href="#discplnz">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure you have successfully completed; then read the <a href="#equipmnt">section on equipment</a> for Book 4 carefully.</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You are a Kai initiate which means that you have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="camflage"> Camouflage</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings. In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Camouflage’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hunting">Hunting</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Lord will never starve in the wild. He will always be able to hunt for food for himself except in areas of wasteland and desert. You are aware that the Wildlands south of the Pass of Moytura are a wasteland and that opportunities for successful hunting may not arise until you reach the Ruanon Forest. But this skill is still very useful for it also enables a Kai Lord to move with great speed and dexterity.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Hunting’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sixthsns">Sixth Sense</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Lord of imminent danger. It may also reveal the true purpose of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Sixth Sense’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="tracking">Tracking</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to make the correct choice of a path in the wild, to discover the location of a person or object in a town or city and to read the secrets of footprints or tracks.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Tracking’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="healing">Healing</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline can be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in combat. If you possess this skill, you may restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to your total for every numbered section of the book you pass through in which you are not involved in combat. (This is only to be used after your <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) Remember that your <small>ENDURANCE</small> cannot rise above its original level.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Healing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wepnskll">Weaponskill</a></h4>

<p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate was taught to master one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines, pick a number in the usual way from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this weapon, you add 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>0 = Dagger</li>
<li>1 = Spear</li>
<li>2 = Mace</li>
<li>3 = Short Sword</li>
<li>4 = Warhammer</li>
<li>5 = Sword</li>
<li>6 = Axe</li>
<li>7 = Sword</li>
<li>8 = Quarterstaff</li>
<li>9 = Broadsword</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean that you set out on this adventure carrying it, but you will have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventure. You cannot carry more than 2 weapons.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponskill in _______ +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points if this weapon carried’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindshld">Mindshield</a></h4>

<p>Some of the hostile creatures of Magnamund have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Kai Discipline of Mindshield prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindshield: no points lost when attacked by Mindblast’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mndblast">Mindblast</a></h4>

<p>This enables a Kai Lord to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used at the same time as normal combat weapons and adds two extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Not all the creatures encountered on this adventure will be harmed by Mindblast. You will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlknsp">Animal Kinship</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to communicate with some animals and to be able to guess the intentions of others.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Kinship’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindomtr">Mind Over Matter</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Discipline enables a Kai Lord to move small objects with his powers of concentration.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mind Over Matter’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 4 of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite>, you may add a further Kai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="../lw/05sots.htm#title">Book 5</a>. This additional skill, together with your other skills and any Special Items that you have found, may then be used in the next adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series which is called <a href="../lw/05sots.htm#title"><cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before leaving Holmgard on your ride south, you are given a <a href="#map">Map of the Southlands</a>, a Badge of Rank that you wear upon the sleeve of your tunic, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess. Remember you can only carry a maximum of fifty Crowns.)</p>
<p>You may take your pick of the following items (in addition to those you already possess, but remember you may only carry two weapons). You may take up to six of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>2 Potions of Laumspur (Backpack Items). Each of these potions restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. Each potion contains enough for one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Spear (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>5 Special Rations (Meals). Each of these Special Rations counts as one Meal, and each takes up one space in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Mace (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Chainmail Waistcoat (Special Items). This adds 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Shield (Special Items) This adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> when used in combat.<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>List the six items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You don’t need to make notes but you can refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Dagger—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Spear—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Special Rations—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Mace—carried in hand.</li>
<li>Chainmail Waistcoat—worn on the body.</li>
<li>Shield—slung over the shoulder when not in combat, otherwise carried in the hand.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at any time.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Sommerlund is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Whenever you kill an enemy and search the body, you may take any Gold Crowns that you find and put them in your Belt Pouch.</dd>
<dt><a name="food">Food</a></dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat (unless you are in an area of wilderness where the opportunity for hunting is limited).</dd>
<dt>Potions of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>These are healing potions that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. They cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for two doses only. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be informed of their effect. All potions are Backpack Items.</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 17.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Winged Devil’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (17 − 20 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as 3. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
<li>Winged Devil loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Training</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles that are bestowed upon Kai Lords at each stage of their training.

<p>Your mission will be fraught with danger, for you are about to venture into the bleak and hostile Wildlands of the south. Use the <a href="#map">map</a> to help you plot your course to Ruanon. Make notes as you progress through the story, for they will be of great help in future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will aid you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>There are several routes to Ruanon, but only one will enable you to reach the mining town and find Captain D’Val with the minimum of danger. A wise choice of Kai Disciplines and a great deal of courage should enable any player to complete the mission, no matter how weak his initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures is not essential for the success of this quest.</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>For three days you lead your brave company of rangers across the lush plains of southern Sommerlund on the first stage of your urgent mission. The flat, treeless fields surround you with a seemingly endless expanse of wheat, so high that even though you are in the saddle it reaches well above your knees. Your horses seem to be swimming through a vast yellow sea of corn that is only interrupted by an occasional track, or group of isolated farmhouses.</p>
<p>The southerners welcome your sudden appearance, but you only make the briefest stops for food and rest, neither wishing to risk becoming a burden, nor alarm these good people with your mission.</p>
<p>By noon on the fourth day, you reach the Pass of Moytura. Here the plains give way to the broken foothills of the Durncrag Mountains. You soon reach a highway, the surface cracked and full of pot-holes, heading off towards the south. This is the notorious Ruanon Pike. South of the pass, the Ruanon Pike crosses a hundred miles of open territory known as ‘Raider’s Road’. Bandit tribes from the Wildlands and Giak war-bands from the mountains of the west frequently ambush those who travel along the Pike, and the regular shipment of gold and gems from the mines at Ruanon have sometimes yielded rich pickings to these merciless robbers.</p>
<p>‘Point and flankers,’ you shout, and immediately three groups of rangers peel away from the column and spur their horses to a gallop. You watch with pride as the expert horsemen take up their scouting positions to the front and side of the company.</p>
<p>It is late afternoon when a ranger scout approaches the company from the west. He points towards a craggy outcrop where a thin spiral of wood smoke betrays a hut hidden beneath the overhanging rock.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the hut, <a href="#sect160">turn to 160</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ignore the hut and continue on your ride along the Ruanon Pike, <a href="#sect273">turn to 273</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>You search the bodies of the dead bandits and discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>12 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Backpack</li>
<li>Enough food for 2 Meals</li>
</ul>
<p>You may take any of the above items but be sure to mark them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Picking up the map that lies on the bloodstained table, you notice that the room in which you now stand has been surrounded by a circle of black ink. The map reveals that a door in the far wall opens on to a passageway leading directly to the surface. Eager to leave the death-filled chamber, you pass through the door and run steadily along the passageway towards a distant shaft of sunlight. It takes several seconds for your eyes to adjust to the glare of the sun, but gradually you realize that you have finally escaped from the Maaken Mines and are in the western foothills less than two miles from Ruanon itself.</p>
<p>However, several bandit warriors can be seen patrolling an entrance to the mines, just below the rocky ledge on which you now crouch. If you are to reach Ruanon alive, you must avoid these patrols at all costs.</p>
<p>Waiting until the enemy patrols have disappeared from view, you make your way down a steep track leading into a copse of densely packed trees. A brief pause for breath is all that you allow yourself before setting off through the forest towards Ruanon.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect200">Turn to 200</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect3">3</a></h3>

<p>You climb the barricade and shout the order: ‘Draw bows!’ And, as the enemy shield-wall closes fast in a deadly race to beat your archers, ‘Fire!’</p>
<p>Their shields of cured skin and wood are no defence against the hail of death that tears into their ranks. The whole line seems to pause and sway; great gaps appear and spearmen fall in heaps on the field. Few escape being injured.</p>
<p>You sense a turn in the tide of battle. The enemy are pulling away from the barricades by the score, carrying their wounded on their backs and on their upturned shields.</p>
<p>You jump from the wall and race back towards the watchtower where Captain D’Val is still embroiled in a bitter struggle against the bandit horsemen. You are about to leap over the body of a dead bandit warrior when he suddenly comes to life and lashes out at your legs with a mace. He was only feigning death and his surprise attack has knocked you to the ground. You lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect62">Turn to 62</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>You recognize the fungi to be Calacena. The spores of these pink mushrooms are much sought after by illusionists and magicians, although it is said that they can cause terrible hallucinations and even madness. As you step gingerly along the corridor, you take great care not to tread or brush against the spore-laden fungi.</p>
<p>The tunnel continues uninterrupted for several miles before eventually reaching a long, deserted gallery.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect40">Turn to 40</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>You push him to the ground and smother him with your Kai cloak. The flames are soon extinguished and you draw away your cloak to see how badly he is injured. Your quick action has saved the captain’s life for although his uniform is burnt and tattered, he has survived the fire unscathed.</p>
<p>‘It is my turn to thank you, Lone Wolf. This time it is you who has saved me from certain death.’</p>
<p>You help the captain to his feet and race to the barricade; the enemy have now reached the ruined perimeter of Ruanon, and they are creeping forward under cover of the broken cottage walls. Climbing up onto an overturned wagon, you order the Sommlending guards back to the barricades. But is it too late to repel the attack?</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect186">Turn to 186</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>You soon reach the junction where the track meets the main highway and the burnt-out wagon lies abandoned at the side of the road.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the wagon, <a href="#sect80">turn to 80</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to ignore the wagon and ride south along the highway, <a href="#sect175">turn to 175</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>Your enemy falls from the saddle, and his body is dragged away by his horse, a twisted foot ensnared in the stirrup. All around you the din of battle rages. You realize that these armour-clad horsemen are no ordinary bandit clan; they fight with a discipline and skill unheard of among the lowly outlaws of the Wildlands.</p>
<p>A horse passes close by, the dead body of a ranger still upright in the saddle. You snatch the reins and retrieve a war-horn from the dead man’s neck. If you are to avoid total disaster, you know that you must quickly sound the retreat.</p>
<p>You wheel your steed towards the south and spur the blood-spattered animal to the gallop. The remnants of your company are close at your heels, the victory cries of your foe resounding in their ears.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect154">Turn to 154</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>Your men secure the boat to a rusty iron ring before following you up the stone steps towards the archway. As you reach a narrow ledge at the top of the granite staircase, you hear strange sounds drifting from the darkness ahead, like the hissing of a jet of steam. It lasts for a few seconds before the crack of a whip and the voice of a man cursing bring it to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter the tunnel, <a href="#sect151">turn to 151</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect9">9</a></h3>

<p>A wave of panic knots your stomach as the bridge drops away beneath your feet. You dive forward and just manage to grasp hold of the slatted wooden floor. But the worst is yet to come. Your grip is slipping, and the bridge is about to crash into the far wall.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to tighten your grip and brace yourself for the shock of impact, <a href="#sect112">turn to 112</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect10">10</a></h3>

<p>The warrior staggers back and tumbles over the ramparts into the raging battle below. His feathered mount ascends and flies away, its hideous caw piercing the storm-black sky.</p>
<p>Lying upon the gore-stained floor is a beautiful Onyx Medallion, which was torn from the warrior’s armour as he fell. If you wish to keep the Onyx Medallion, place it in your pocket and mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.</p>

<h3><a name="sect12">12</a></h3>

<p>Fifty miles south of Ruanon, the ruined city of Maaken teeters on the brink of Maakengorge. A cold sweat breaks out upon your brow as you contemplate the difficulty of your mission, for you are separated from your goal by fifty miles of enemy-held territory. But there is still a flicker of hope; with the enemy in confusion and retreat, your chances of success will be far higher now than before battle.</p>
<p>Before you set off on your perilous mission, Captain D’Val offers you the choice of the following equipment and provisions:<sup><a href="#sect12-1-foot" name="sect12-1">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Enough food for 3 Meals</li>

<h3><a name="sect14">14</a></h3>

<p>Your rangers spread out and move stealthily forward under cover of the large boulders. When you are almost close enough to reach out and touch the enemy, you give a piercing whistle—the signal to attack! In unison, your men rise up and strike. Two bandits die instantly, their skulls cloven in two by ranger swords. A third turns to run, but he is felled from behind and swept away in the foam-flecked water. Your target is a formidable looking warrior; great bracers of steel encase his wrists and a grim necklace of shrunken skulls adorns his leather battle-jerkin. You strike first, but his reactions are lightning-fast. He turns your blow aside with his spear and lunges at your face.</p>

<h3><a name="sect16">16</a></h3>

<p>You reach the door and quickly make your escape. The land behind the tavern is steep and heavily forested. Two of your men follow, but they are both badly wounded and cannot keep up with you. You turn to shout encouragement, only to witness their deaths as they are brutally stabbed to the ground. The bandit murderers wipe their blades and sprint towards you.</p>

<h3><a name="sect17">17</a></h3>

<p>A spear tip has grazed your forearm. It is a mere scratch, yet your arm has become numb and useless. You strike back at your assailant, hoping to catch him as he pulls back, but your blow is weak and poorly aimed. Your vision is becoming a blur; you cannot coordinate your movements. Blind terror engulfs you as you suddenly realize that the bandits are using poisoned weapons.</p>
<p>A spear catches you beneath the arm and another sinks into your chest. As darkness engulfs you from all sides, the last sight you remember is the triumphant grimaces of your murderers as they stab you to death.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your mission end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect18">18</a></h3>

<p>You recognize the hoof prints of a Sommlending cavalry horse. There are two sets of tracks, and you are sure that they were made by two of your missing scouts. You decide to follow them eastwards in the hope of finding your men.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect150">Turn to 150</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect19">19</a></h3>

<p>You instantly recognize these amulets. They are the symbols of a Holy Order known as ‘The Redeemers’, a silent order of pilgrims devoted to a lifetime of prayer and healing. You apologize for your hasty reaction. The holy men both nod their shaven heads in forgiveness.</p>
<p>Your men have pitched camp beneath the marble canopy, and preparations are soon underway for a good night’s sleep. You are hungry and you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect233">Turn to 233</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect20">20</a></h3>

<p>An arrow hisses overhead; a scream of agony fills the air. The bow slips from the archer’s fingers as he sinks to his knees, the arrow lodged deep between his startled eyes. The clack of fangs and the soft swift pad of stealthy feet tell you that the Warhounds are closing in. You look up to see a man running towards you from the barricade. He has a shield in one hand and a longbow in the other; it is Guard Captain D’Val. He reaches you, breathless from his run, and draws an arrow from his quiver. D’Val aims and fires, drawing another arrow from his quiver as soon as the first is loosed. The Warhounds tumble and crash to the ground around you, felled by D’Val’s deadly shafts. Eight lie dead before his quiver is empty.</p>
<p>The captain grabs you by the arm and, swinging you over his shoulder in one swift motion, carries you back towards the barricade. Others run forward to help you, but the bandit archers are now in range and your men are forced back by a hail of arrows. The red shafts of the enemy whistle past on all sides. You reach the barricade, a wagon is pulled aside, and you are carried in through the gap. Captain D’Val is close to exhaustion; he staggers, and his men rush to catch him before he drops to the ground.</p>

<h3><a name="sect25">25</a></h3>

<p>After journeying through the rich wheat fields of southern Sommerlund, the view that lies before you now looks especially bleak and colourless. The landscape is flat and desolate, only relieved here and there by a ragged copse of stunted firs or mound of broken earth. (You have entered the Wildlands south of the Pass of Moytura and cannot use the Kai Discipline of Hunting to hunt for food in this desolate area.) During the afternoon, storm clouds gather above the peaks of the Durncrag Mountains to the west, and the roll of distant thunder warns of imminent rain. It is early evening when your scouts find the ruins of an old temple, less than a mile from the highway.</p>

<p>As you run towards the ladder, the dreadful screams of your dying men claw at your ears, as they are eaten alive. You stop and stare back into the tunnel. The Stoneworm is now barely twenty feet away and is slithering towards you at a terrifying pace. You know that you will never reach the ladder in time to escape. In desperation, you raise your weapon and prepare for combat. The creature is immune to Mindblast.</p>

<h3><a name="sect28">28</a></h3>

<p>As the warrior lets out his last dying gasp of pain, he topples back into the mine shaft and plummets into the darkness. His men seem stunned by your fighting prowess, and trip over each other in their haste to escape a similar fate.

<p>The hideous creature uncoils itself from your legs and sinks into the water. You are elated by your victory, but your lungs feel as if they are on fire. You claw your way upwards until you eventually reach the surface, choking and gasping for air.</p>
<p>The only sign of the rowing boat and your men that remains on the surface of this dark and dreadful river is a splintered oar floating nearby. You hook your arm over this and drift with the current towards the far bank. A check of your Backpack and pockets reveals that nothing was lost during your struggle in the water, but this discovery comes as cold comfort now that your brave company is no more.</p>
<p>Steeling yourself against the unknown dangers that may lie ahead, you resolve to reach Ruanon and uncover the veil of mystery that surrounds it. But first you allow yourself one last look at the black river before you enter the west tunnel.</p>

<p>Using your Kai skill, you blend into the shadows of the chamber wall and slowly inch your way nearer and nearer to the bridge.

You see your chance and sprint towards the bridge, your weapon poised to strike down the unwary guard.</p>

<h3><a name="sect36">36</a></h3>

<p>The Warhounds lope towards you at an unnerving speed. You can see their great red-lipped jaws clearly and hear the clacking of their fangs. You fight to control your breathing, to concentrate all your warrior skills, for you must dispatch the Warhounds quickly and with precision if you are to avoid being torn to pieces. Two dogs, faster than their brothers, break free of the pack and close upon you. They leap simultaneously, their slavering jaws spread wide for attack. You dive forward and roll, striking at their bellies from beneath as they pass above. Both howl with rage and pain and tumble lifeless to the ground. You are back on your feet as the next Warhound attacks.</p>

<p>You signal to the driver to stop. The wagons halt and a small, moon-faced man in a bright pink tunic throws open the rear door of the leading carriage. He shouts and curses the driver as he descends the ladder, pausing only to adjust the cummerbund that barely covers his huge stomach. Seeing your men, he lets out a strangled shriek and fumbles for a short sword hanging at his side. ‘Bandits! Robbers!’ he cries, and wrestles to free his sword from its ornate scabbard. A row of anxious faces appears at the wagon windows, but the expressions soon change to a smile when they recognize your Sommlending uniforms.</p>
<p>‘Calm yourself, Yesu,’ shouts an elderly woman. ‘They are Sommlending rangers. They will not steal your gold.’ Laughter ripples along the carriages as the little fat man suddenly unsheathes his sword with such force that he spins around and tumbles to the ground.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration III]</div>
<p>‘You must forgive Yesu,’ says the old woman. ‘He means you no harm. “Raider’s Road” has made him a nervous wreck.’</p>
<p>You question the old woman, asking her where they have come from and their destination. You learn that they are a troupe of players and have journeyed many miles from their native land of Cloeasia in the east. They last played for the people of Eshnar, but it was a disappointing show. It seems that the town was as quiet as the grave; those who did come to see them were a sad and sorry crowd. They are now bound for Holmgard, and hopefully a more appreciative audience.</p>
<p>‘Light is fading,’ remarks the old woman. ‘Perhaps you and your men will camp with us tonight? We would deem it an honour, and would be happy to entertain you all with songs and dancing.’ You notice a hopeful look in the eyes of your men as they await your decision.</p>

<p>No cargo remains inside the charred shell of the wagon. The wood is black, and the metal fittings have buckled and blistered in the heat. However, in spite of the damage, you find enough proof from the ashes to confirm your suspicions. This is the wreck of a Sommlending cavalry wagon; one of three that left for Ruanon with Captain D’Val’s troop over a month ago.</p>
<p>As you stand in the wagon, brushing the ash from your hands, one of your men suddenly cries out in pain. You glance up in time to see him fall from his horse, a disc of sharp steel embedded in his chest. ‘Ambush! Take cover!’ you shout, as more of the deadly discs whistle out of the trees to claim their victims. Frightened horses gallop in all directions, your men desperately clinging to the reins. The hidden attackers vanish as quickly as they came, but not before three of your men are left dead upon the highway.</p>
<p>After burying your dead, you must decide on the best course of action; for now only four men remain at your side and the hidden enemy may return at any time to finish their evil handiwork.</p>

<p>The arrow arcs through the smoke-blackened sky and pierces the officer’s shining breastplate. You hear his scream of pain ring out above the din of battle and watch as his cruel eyes flicker and close. He swoons and slips from his saddle, your arrow lodged deep in his heart.</p>

<p>As the rangers encircle the ruins, the strangers make a dash for the highway. Your men give chase and swiftly dispatch them with their swords. One of the robed men shatters a small flask as he falls to the ground. A search of the bodies reveals 12 Gold Crowns and enough food for two Meals. If you wish to keep any of these items, remember to mark them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. You notice that both of the men wear amulets on chains around their necks.

<p>You have barely taken a dozen steps when you are confronted by a hideous sight. The tunnel ahead is blocked by a huge and slimy creature, its skin covered with warts that glow with a greenish luminescence. You draw your weapon as it moves closer, hopping from one clawed foot to the other. Suddenly, a pair of wings sprouts from its back, and it leaps into the air. You feel your stomach contract as it hurtles towards you, its razor-fanged mouth opening wider and wider.</p>

<p>‘You must save her, Lone Wolf. You must prevent the sacrifice!’ The Baron’s voice is choked with emotion.</p>
<p>‘Save who? Who must he save?’ questions Captain D’Val, as he tries to calm the excited Baron.</p>
<p>‘My daughter, Madelon, of course,’ the Baron answers. Tears are welling up in his eyes and nervously he wrings his hands. Then he utters the ominous prophecy:</p>
<blockquote class="poetry"><p>
When the full moon shines o’er the temple deep,<br />A sacrifice will stir from sleep<br />The legions of a long forgotten lord.<br />When a fair royal maid on the altar dies,<br />The dead of Maakengorge shall rise<br />To claim their long-awaited reward.
</p></blockquote>
<p>‘Don’t you see? Barraka has found the dagger of Vashna. He is going to sacrifice my daughter upon the altar of Maaken to release the undead of Maakengorge, the Chasm of Doom.’</p>
<p>‘During the Age of the Black Moon, King Ulnar of Sommerlund killed the mightiest of all the Darklords, Vashna, with the Sommerswerd—the sword of the sun. Vashna’s body and the bodies of all his troops were hurled into the bottomless abyss of Maakengorge. He plans to lead the dead to victory; first to conquer Sommerlund and then all of the Lastlands,’ explains the Baron, fear in his eyes.</p>
<p>You stare at the Baron in stunned silence. If Barraka completes the sacrifice, all is lost. What mortal army can stand against a legion of the dead?</p>
<p>Captain D’Val ushers you from the chamber and closes the door. ‘I feared he was insane, and I refused to listen to his words. But the events of the last few days confirm my worst nightmare. He speaks the truth!’</p>
<p>As the dreadful significance of the prophetic verse begins to chill your spine, your thoughts are broken by the shrill blast of a war-horn. Captain D’Val strides over to an arrow slit in the wall and looks out across the desolate plain. As he turns to speak, his face is ashen grey. ‘The bandits—they’re launching an attack!’</p>

A host of hideous, bat-winged reptiles are flying towards you, their scaly hands grasping jagged pieces of stalagmite. You cannot evade combat and must fight them all as one enemy.</p>

A ranger at your side suddenly screams in agony, a flat circle of razor-sharp steel embedded in his chest. More of the discs follow whistling down from the rooftops to claim their victims.

<p>No sooner have his words echoed through the hall than a sword blade pierces his heart. You turn and run towards a distant door where a tunnel disappears towards the north.

As a precaution against such a surprise attack, you send three of your men on ahead with orders to report back if they should sight anything at all unusual.</p>
<p>After travelling some distance, you come across the wreck of a burnt-out wagon abandoned at the side of the road. Behind it, a track disappears eastwards up into the hills. There is no sign of your scouts, who should have returned to report this abandoned wreck.</p>

Neither of them speaks, but they remove amulets from around their necks and offer them as some kind of identification.

<p>Struggling to your feet, you stagger along the forest track as it ascends into the darkening foothills of the Maaken Range. The track comes to an abrupt end at the entrance of a mine tunnel, partially obscured by foliage. You realize this must be a disused route into the Maaken Mines, for they honeycomb the foothills and mountains of this region. You know that if you can locate one of the major shafts, you should be able to trace your way through the mines to Ruanon itself.</p>
<p>Just inside the tunnel entrance, you find a broken crate containing five Torches and a Tinderbox. The tunnel is pitch black and you will need at least one torch to light your way. You may take as many additional Torches as you wish before continuing, but each Torch takes up one space in your Backpack.<sup><a href="#sect79-1-foot" name="sect79-1">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the fire has totally destroyed any markings there may have been, there still remains enough of the charred shell for you to recognize its military origin. It is a Sommlending cavalry wagon, one of three that accompanied Captain D’Val and his troop. It was loaded with food and equipment when it left Holmgard one month ago, but all that remains of its cargo now are heaps of ash. Once you have satisfied yourself that nothing has been overlooked that may give a clue to Captain D’Val’s fate, you remount your horse and lead your men southwards along the highway.</p>

<p>In the dim light of the interior, you see an old man seated at a table. The flicker of a log fire is all that illuminates this foul-smelling hovel, yet it sheds enough light for you to see the clutter of charts and strange instruments that crowd the hut. The man slowly raises his gaze from a large crystal sphere and bids you sit opposite him.</p>
<p>‘You know my name—how?’ you ask warily.</p>
<p>‘The stars foretold our meeting long ago, Lone Wolf,’ he replies, slowly passing his withered old hands around the sphere. ‘Be not alarmed by my knowledge for I wish only to aid you.’ He produces a small scroll of parchment from within his robe, and he hands it to you. Upon the scroll is written the following verse:</p>
<blockquote class="poetry"><p>
When the full moon shines o’er the temple deep,<br />A sacrifice will stir from sleep<br />The legions of a long forgotten lord.<br />When a fair royal maid on the altar dies,<br />The dead of Maakengorge shall rise<br />To claim their long-awaited reward.

<p>You ask the meaning of the strange verse, but the old man does not answer you. He seems to have fallen into a deep trance.

<p>An empty feeling grips your stomach as you stare upon the altar and inner sanctum of the subterranean temple. Your Kai senses burn as if every nerve in your body is screaming a warning to flee from this evil chamber. Huge braziers of molten metal encircle a black altar upon which lies fair Madelon, the daughter of Baron Vanalund. She seems to be entranced—her breathing is slow and shallow. Beyond the altar lie two massive doors, a gigantic skull engraved upon their black stone surface. Out of your view, another door opens, and a procession of red-cloaked priests enters the temple. Their heads are covered and they each carry strange amulets of black stone. They file past the altar, depositing the amulets in a circle around the young girl’s body and then file out again in total silence. Then you hear the sound of a distant drumbeat; it grows louder and nearer. The measured steps of steel-shod boots resound in its wake. Barraka is approaching.</p>

<p>A tall warrior in bright scarlet armour suddenly breaks clear of the shield-wall and runs at you. His sword is raised to stab.</p>

<p>As you drift beneath the arch of the southern tunnel, you pull your Kai cloak around your body and raise the hood. The ceiling is leaking and huge drops of ore-stained water rain down on your crowded boat, streaking the hair and tunics of your men a rusty brown.</p>
<p>You row for over a mile before eventually emerging in a small grotto. A flight of stone steps rises out of the river and ascends to an archway in the rock wall.</p>

<p>‘I was hoping the King would send a large search party,’ says Captain D’Val wryly, now having fully recovered from his exhaustion. ‘I was beginning to tire of this town.’</p>
<p>You rise from your straw bed and offer your thanks to the captain. His brave and timely action saved you from certain death. ‘ ’Tis nothing to compare with you, Lone Wolf. Your bravery is legend. Your presence here is worth a hundred men.’</p>
<p>He asks you about your mission, and you recount the events that have led you to this meeting; the ride south, the loss of your company, your passage through the Maaken Mines and the bandits.</p>
<p>‘Yes, the bandits—Barraka’s men,’ retorts D’Val, his gruff voice conveying his contempt for them and their leader. ‘It seems we have both suffered at his hand. A month ago, he and his Vassagonian renegades ambushed my troop on the Ruanon Pike. We were sorely outnumbered and the fight was indeed bitter. But we broke free from them and escaped here to Ruanon. We have been beleaguered ever since and praying for help to arrive. We have enough weapons to resist them, but we have barely enough food and water to survive.’</p>
<p>You ask what has become of the people of Ruanon. ‘Most are now slaves. Barraka has taken the mines and he uses the Ruanese as forced labour. Other than yourself, only one man has escaped from the mines and survived the Warhounds and the bandit snipers. That man is Baron Oren Vanalund. Come, I shall take you to him.’</p>
<p>D’Val leads you to the topmost chamber of the watchtower and pushes open an iron-shod door. The sight that greets you fills your heart with sorrow and pity.</p>

<p>Onward and upward, you claw your way through the wooded hillside. Your throat is dry and your heart is pounding as though it is about to burst, but you dare not slacken your pace. Four hours pass before you feel certain that you have outrun the enemy.</p>
<p>It is nearly dusk when you chance upon a narrow steep-sided valley, carved from the hillside to afford access to a mine tunnel. For hundreds of years, the ore of the Maaken Range has been the blessing and the bane of many who have ventured here to seek their fortune: men have found wealth beyond their wildest dreams, but also men have perished without trace in its labyrinth of cold dark tunnels.</p>
<p>You examine the mine entrance. You know that if you can find a major passage, you could trace your way to Ruanon itself. At the entrance, you find a discarded wooden crate, containing six Torches and a Tinderbox. The mines are dark and you will need to use at least one torch to light your way.

<p>A mantlet, a large shield on wheels, is being pushed slowly across the body-strewn battleground towards the barricade. Arrow shafts soon bristle from its thick wooden planks as D’Val’s men fire their bows time and time again in an attempt to hit the shielded foe.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VII]</div>
<p>Suddenly a robed figure darts from behind the mantlet and levels a black staff at the barricade. He is cut down by an arrow, but not before he has let loose from his staff a guttering ball of flame. It cartwheels across the plain and explodes with a tremendous roar, hurling the bodies of defenders and shattered barricade high into the air. Through the cloud of dust and debris, you can see a line of enemy cavalry charging across the plain. They wear tall plumed helmets of polished steel and breastplates of deepest crimson. In the wake of the fireball they pour through the remains of the barricade and attack—they give no quarter. A horseman spurs his horse towards you, his lance levelled at your chest.</p>

<p>All around the barricade the enemy are retreating in disorder; bandit war-horns announce the withdrawal, exhorting their defeated warriors to flee the battlefield. A jubilant Captain D’Val emerges from the war-smoke, his eyes shining like jewels beneath the rim of his battered helmet. ‘We have triumphed, Lone Wolf. We have vanquished the foe!’</p>
<p>All around you, the captain’s men are rebuilding the barricade and tending to their wounded comrades. It sorrows you to see Sommlending dead, but you take heart at how few they are beside the enemy’s losses.</p>

<p>The words of the verse flood into your mind and a chill runs down your spine as you realize what may lie ahead.

<p>It was here, during the Age of the Black Moon, that King Ulnar of Sommerlund killed the mightiest of the Darklords—Lord Vashna. In mortal combat upon the very brink of the abyss, the Darklord was slain by the Sommerswerd.

A Vassagonian herald, his crimson armour torn and his face smeared with blood, breaks free from the battle and sounds the retreat. You watch as the surviving bandits spur their mounts to the gallop, desperate to escape through the ragged hole in the barricade. Gripped by panic and fatigue, they ride through their own foot soldiers who are advancing to support them. The infantry falter and collapse as the cavalry ride them down.</p>

<p>The hoof prints end at the entrance but two sets of footprints continue into the mine.</p>

<p>The floor of the tunnel is covered with the decaying remains of rodents. The sound of cracking bones makes you wince with disgust as you and your men step gingerly through the foul-smelling debris.</p>
<p>You reach a section where the tunnel curves abruptly to the east, revealing the reflections of torchlight on the rough stone walls. A quick check ahead confirms your suspicions; two armour-clad warriors stand guard at a well sunk into a torchlit chamber.</p>

<p>You release the shaft and it whistles towards the bandit leader, but he sees its deadly approach and raises his polished steel shield. Your heart sinks as the arrow is turned aside; it shatters harmlessly against the watchtower wall. Before you can fire again, the bow is suddenly kicked from your grasp. You are confronted by an armoured warrior. He stands above you on the barricade wall, and you cannot evade his attack.</p>

<p>Hundreds of minute creatures busily file up and down the yellowed stalks. Your whole body begins to prickle as you imagine they are swarming up your legs, up your sleeves and down the neck of your tunic.

<p>The bandits amble past barely inches from where you hide, totally oblivious to your presence. When you are sure they are no longer on the track, you jump up and frantically scratch at your itching skin. To your horror, you discover that your legs are covered with crawling insects feasting on your blood. Ripping your clothes off, you empty them from your boots and scrape them from your skin before hurrying off along the track.

<p>Raising the hood of your Kai cloak, you crouch in the bottom of an empty ore wagon and wait with bated breath. Through a gap in the wood you can see a haggard procession of men shuffling towards you. An escort of bandit warriors pushes them forward, beating any who falter or slip out of line. You feel a sudden jolt as your wagon is pushed along the tunnel and glance up to see a sweat-streaked face peering down at you. ‘Run left when I say “Go”,’ whispers the face which then disappears over the edge of the wagon.</p>
<p>As the wagon emerges from the tunnel, sunlight suddenly floods over you. Through the crack you can now see your destination; the wagons are being shunted onto a timber gantry where the track ends some fifty feet above a huge mound of ore.

<p>You are winded by the blow to your chest and flung backwards into the icy cold water. You surface, but barely in time to catch a breath before a tentacle coils around your legs and drags you down.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, and note this number down in the margin of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (In this case 0 = 10 instead of zero). This number represents the number of combat rounds that you can endure underwater before you begin to lose additional <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to lack of oxygen.

<p>You hear the thud of a heavy drawbar sliding back, and a burly man dressed in a leather jerkin appears at the tavern door. ‘Welcome to my humble inn, my lord. Pardon my suspicion, but this is a very dangerous area; one mistake can cost us our lives.’</p>
<p>You signal to your men to stable their horses, and you follow the innkeeper into his tavern. The bar looks more like an armoury than a drinking hall. Quivers of arrows stand beside each of the iron-studded window shutters, and racks of spears line the far wall. The place is deserted except for three young men who all bear a strong resemblance to the tavern-keeper. One of them has his head swathed in bandages.</p>
<p>You ask the tavern-keeper how much he will charge for your men to billet here tonight and are quite surprised to hear his reply. ‘Nothing,’ he says, moving tables aside so that your rangers can sleep upon the tavern floor. ‘Your presence here tonight will be worth more than gold to us. We’ve been attacked by bandits every night since the last full moon.’</p>
<p>As the last of your men return from the stables, the doors are closed and barred. It has started to rain and your men seem greatly relieved to be inside where it is warm and dry.</p>

<p>A bolt of lightning gashes the stormy sky, illuminating the figures of the bandits as they creep into the stables. Crouching on the balcony, you signal to your men to prepare themselves. Dropping onto the stable roof, you discover to your dismay that the clay tiles are wafer-thin and splinter beneath your weight; you crash straight through the flimsy roof into the hay below. Luckily you are unharmed by the fall and quickly regain your feet, but a bandit stands barely inches from your face, his sword raised to strike.</p>

<p>You toss a rock along the tunnel to attract the guards’ attention. It works! Within seconds you can hear footsteps approaching. You attack. The guards barely have time to gasp as your men leap out of the darkness and overpower them. Once disarmed, their hands are tied and they are herded back into the well chamber.</p>

<p>You soon enter a chamber divided by a deep mine shaft. Spanning the shaft is a wooden bridge at the entrance of which a swarthy warrior stands guard. He has been alerted by the screams of your pursuers, and as soon as he sees you, he runs towards a rope that hangs from the ceiling, leaving the bridge unguarded. Your pursuers are nearly upon you.</p>

<p>The trees are alive with bandit patrols, but your quick wits and Kai skills prevent you from being seen by them. Eventually you reach the edge of the copse. You find yourself staring out across an expanse of open plain towards Ruanon. The sight that lies before you is very disquieting.</p>
<p>Much of the mining town has been burnt to the ground. The blackened ruins of what were once shops, cottages, and taverns are now little more than smouldering mounds of charcoal. You are beginning to fear the worst, that Ruanon has been totally destroyed, when a gentle breeze clears the haze of wood smoke hanging like a grey curtain over the ruins. Inside the perimeter of ruined buildings, a barricade has been thrown up around a tower of stone. Above the tower, a tattered flag still flies bringing renewed hope; it is the sun-flag of Sommerlund edged with a band of white braid—the cavalry standard of the King’s Guard Regiment.</p>
<p>The sudden crack of a twig makes you freeze. You glance behind to see three bandits creeping through the trees towards you. The wide steel tips of their spears glint. They seem to be coated with a clear, sticky fluid.</p>

<p>The fungi are soft and dry, and they taste dreadful! You retch and choke as the dry, powdery fungi absorb all the saliva in your mouth. You are hit by waves of nausea that make you panic, and desperately you claw at your tongue trying to scrape the fungi from your mouth.</p>

<p>You bypass a village with orange-wood cabins and stone walls, and climb through the tall fields towards a wooded ridge. Beyond the ridge, you enter thick forest and discover a bubbling freshwater stream. You drink deeply and realize how hungry you are. You must eat a Meal here or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>As night falls you reach the city of Maaken. The gaunt, weed-infested ruins of this shattered city are spread like a vast graveyard and bathed in the eerie light of a near-full moon. A sound fills the air like the wailing of lost souls; it is the cry of Maakengorge.</p>
<p>It has been nearly two days since you last slept and fatigue begins to overwhelm you. Drawing your Kai cloak about your shoulders, you settle down to sleep; you will need all your strength for the daunting task that lies ahead.</p>

<p>As the first light of dawn breaks over the eastern horizon, you scan the mist-shrouded highway for any sign of life. None of your scouts have returned, and your remaining four men are visibly anxious. With marauding bandit hordes to the north, hostile mountains to the west and a two-day ride to the nearest town to the east, your choice of action is limited.</p>

<h3><a name="sect207">207</a></h3>

<p>You snatch an arrow from a quiver hanging on the wall and draw the bowstring taut to your lips. A bandit horseman races across the plain with a javelin held high in his hand. His quarry is a wounded Sommlending soldier, who has fallen from the barricade and lies on the plain, unarmed and helpless. The bandit is poised to throw his javelin when you loose your arrow.</p>

<p>You have run less than twenty yards when you reach the end of the tunnel—a solid rock-face. The passage has only recently been excavated, and you are now trapped in a dead end. You hear the footsteps of your pursuers and turn to face them, knowing only too well that your only chances of survival now rest on your ability to be able to fight your way out of this trap and make your way back to the junction where you can take the left-hand tunnel.</p>

<p>The lance has tom through your cloak and pitched you onto your back. You scramble to your feet in time to see the horseman discard his splintered lance and draw a curved broadsword. A wicked smile spreads across his grim features, exposing a jagged line of blackened teeth. He spits out his battle-cry and spurs his horse towards you once more.</p>

<p>You have a very uneasy feeling about this town. So far you have only seen women and children shuffling along the street; there has been no sign of any men whatsoever.

<p>Your tactics have worked. The bandits ignore your small group of horsemen and pursue the others towards the west. Once they reach the wooded foothills of the Durncrag Mountains, your rangers will have no difficulty evading the enemy among the densely packed firs.</p>
<p>When the bandits have disappeared from view, you call a halt and allow your men to rest. In spite of the number of men you have lost, they are still eager to continue the mission.</p>

<p>An overwhelming stench of dampness and decay pervades the shaft. You decide to send one of your men up the ladder to make sure that it is still secure. All seems well, for he soon reaches the next level and signals you all to follow. The tunnel on the upper level leads to an oval-shaped, rough-hewn chamber where a strange silky fluid coats the floor.</p>

<p>You can feel a current of dank, cold air against your face as you walk along the tunnel. The rock walls sparkle with a glistening ore that catches the light from your torch and reflects it in a dazzling display of colours. Fatigue and the distraction of the dancing lights make you oblivious to the fungi in which you now stand. A cloud of pink spores is beginning to rise, clogging your mouth and nostrils and threatening to suffocate you unless you act quickly.</p>

<p>Barraka carries the stench of death and decay about him. He strides into the temple, his boots of Gourgaz hide covering both legs and feet, and slams shut the huge stone door with frightening ease. He stands in silence before pushing open the huge black doors engraved with the menacing skulls. Suddenly a gale force wind sweeps through the temple and your ears are filled by a terrible scream. Beyond the open doors, a pier of stone juts into the abyss of Maakengorge: you are staring into the Chasm of Doom.</p>
<p>Barraka turns away from the windswept pier and walks slowly towards the altar. From a hidden scabbard he removes a twisted black dagger and holds its stiletto blade to the light. An evil blue flame runs up and down the black steel spike, flickering in the ice-cold winds of Maakengorge. The sacrifice is about to begin.</p>

<p>The arrow flies straight and true towards the bandit, striking home beneath his raised arm. He screams and falls backwards, impaling himself on his own javelin as he crashes to the ground. You are about to draw another arrow when you see a menacing black shape dart across the sky; it plummets downwards and lands on the watchtower roof. You discard your bow and unsheathe your weapon as you race up the stairs to investigate.</p>

<p>It takes half an hour for you to recover from your ordeal and to take in your new surroundings. You are standing at the edge of a huge slag-heap, which rises out of the dark waters of the underground river. Less than twenty feet from the summit, a dim light illuminates a long stone chute. You decide to take a closer look. You soon discover that the climb is long, slow, and arduous, and only after an hour of strenuous effort do you finally find yourself at the top in a small service tunnel. The tunnel is deserted except for a mine wagon parked near to the tunnel entrance.</p>

<p>You soon reach a hall divided by a wide chasm. It is deathly quiet here, and even the slightest noise seems to echo around the grey-stone walls like a clash of cymbals.

<p>In the plush candlelit interior of the caravan you find the actor, cowering beneath a blanket in the far corner. You flick the blanket aside and ask the petrified man to explain how he came to possess such a fine sword.</p>
<p>‘I…I bought it in Eshnar,’ he stammers, his eyes wide with fear, ‘from the innkeeper of the “Pick and Shovel” tavern.’ He grasps the sword by the blade and offers it to you. ‘If it is your sword I have unwittingly bought, I am truly sorry. Here, please take it.’</p>
<p>You grip the brass hilt and examine it closely. There is no doubt: it is a Sommlending cavalry sword, but the inscription on the blade makes your heart miss a beat: ‘Captain Remir D’Val—King’s Guard Regiment’.</p>

<p>Pushing open the trapdoor, you climb out onto the watchtower roof. You are greeted by a shocking sight. The bodies of Sommlending soldiers lie scattered over the floor; their armour is rent and torn and they have all suffered terrible wounds. Over the carnage hovers a monstrous bird. Its wings beat the smoke-filled air, its razor-sharp talons slashing and mutilating everything they touch. Astride the creature sits a warrior wreathed in iron and steel, the scimitar in his hand stained with Sommlending blood. He swings one leg from his gem-encrusted saddle, pauses, and then leaps down to the watchtower roof. A voice echoes in your head as the warrior closes in.</p>
<p>‘Say your prayers, Sommlending, for your life is soon to end!’</p>

<p>You try to ignore your aching legs and the fear that knots your stomach by forcing your concentration on the sun-flag, a fluttering symbol of hope in the distance. Your face is streaked with sweat, and your lungs feel as though they will burst, but you dare not slacken your pace; the thought of Warhound fangs closing and tugging on your skin is all you need to drive you forward.</p>
<p>At four hundred yards, you can see that the barricade and watchtower are inhabited, but at this distance the faces you can see are only a line of small, pink dots on the walls. At three hundred yards, you run into some gruesome remains, where the corpses of bandits lie twisted on the ground, most killed by arrows. Many have lain in the open for weeks; a flock of startled carrion crows rise shrieking from their feast as you race through the bodies. You turn away in disgust.</p>
<p>Suddenly a new sound drifts across the plain: the sound of cheering. The beleaguered defenders have spotted you and recognized your green Kai cloak. Two hundred yards to go. You have just passed the ruins of a burnt-out cottage when you feel an agonizing pain tear through your left thigh. An arrow has pierced your leg, and you pitch forward into the mud and ash.</p>

<p>Your rest is disturbed by the anxious shout of the night guard: ‘Awake! Awake! We’re under attack!’</p>
<p>Throwing back their blankets, your men leap to their feet, peering through the teeming rain at the shadowy silhouette of horsemen circling the ruins. Suddenly an arrow whistles through the darkness. Your lookout screams and falls to his knees. ‘Form a circle,’ you shout. ‘Keep behind cover!’</p>
<p>The rangers gather swords and shields and press themselves against the wet temple marble for protection. The sound of metal-shod boots on stone makes you spin around. A dozen warriors dressed in shiny red armour are clambering across the broken pillars. Two rangers run to block their advance, but they are felled by one sweep of the warrior leader’s broadsword. Then the warrior sees you and quickens his pace. His bloodied sword is raised to strike again. You cannot evade combat and must fight the warrior to the death.</p>

Suddenly the door bursts open to reveal two bandit warriors, their bows raised; arrows fly and rangers fall from their horses. Drawing your weapon, you charge your attackers, but the other bandits appear from every side, and your men are caught in a murderous crossfire.</p>
<p>However, the speed of your attack panics the bowmen. They turn to run but you cut them down before they have taken a few steps. Then a dark-skinned warrior with black oily hair appears at a window opposite. He flicks his hand, and a knife thuds into your arm. You lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Gritting your teeth, you wrench the blade free and hurl it back. The bandit dies instantly. Clutching your wounded arm, you stagger through the building and escape through a rear door.

<p>For over ten miles, the river wends its steady course southwards. You pass through several grottos, but their rocky banks are so steep that they make a landing impossible. You are rowing along a particularly wide tunnel when you suddenly realize that the boat is moving faster and faster, and the faint sound of rushing water is gradually increasing. Soon the whole tunnel is filled with a thundering cacophony of noise.</p>
<p>You brace yourself in preparation for rough water, but you are totally unprepared for the sight that befalls you. Less than fifty feet away, the river disappears over the edge of a massive waterfall. Desperately your men row against the current towards the tunnel wall, but it is too late: you are caught in the current and are hurtling towards the edge of the waterfall.</p>

<p>The ceiling of the cavern is so low that you are forced to all press yourselves against the bottom of the boat to avoid head injuries. For nearly an hour the boat is swept through a maze of underground waterways before coming to a sudden halt; you are grounded upon a bank of shingle.

<p>You soon reach a section where the tunnel has collapsed and a large mound of earth rises almost to the ceiling. Desperately, you climb the mound, claw your way through the narrow gap, and then drop to the passageway beyond. Here you discover a loose timber prop. When everyone is clear, you barge it with your shoulder; the prop splinters and tons of earth and stone come crashing down to seal the tunnel. As the dust settles, you stare into the darkness ahead. On the walls you can just make out a line of torches. Your men gather these and light them before you continue on your way.</p>

<p>You are helped tonight by a cloudless sky, for the highway is illuminated by the pale moonlight. You order three of your men to scout ahead, for you know the notorious reputation this forested highway has for sudden bandit ambushes; the densely packed trees lining the road could easily conceal an army of robbers. Before the scouts gallop away, you order them to report anything unusual they may find on the road ahead.</p>
<p>Within an hour, you arrive at a junction where a track from the east meets the main highway. Abandoned at the side of the road is a burnt-out wagon. You sense that something is wrong; your scouts should have reported this wagon long before you found it, and your men are worried by what may have happened to them. You know that you dare not continue your ride in case you fall into an ambush. You decide to rest at the junction and wait for the return of your scouts.

<p>You smash feet-first into a large river boulder. Recoiling from the impact, you cough uncontrollably in your desperate fight for air as the water fills your ears and nose. Down and down, around and around you go, your eyes stinging and the pain in your legs grinding agonizingly upwards through your body. A glancing blow to your shoulder rips the sleeve from your jacket and numbs your arm; your weapon falls from your hand. You are somersaulted into a steep V-shaped channel and buffeted on all sides as you tumble towards a pool far below. You feel the sheer weight and volume of water behind you will plunge you to your doom, and as you plummet into the swirling dark water, all consciousness rapidly gives way to a blind and silent numbness.</p>
<p>When you open your eyes it is dusk. You have been washed up on the river bank near to a twisting forest track. The silhouette of the Maaken Range rises steeply to the east, and you realize that you must have drifted many miles downstream. You have survived a terrible ordeal; one that would have killed any lesser mortal. You have lost 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to leg and head wounds and one Weapon. (If you possess two Weapons, you may choose which one you have lost.) All of your Special Items, Backpack Items, and Gold Crowns are still intact.</p>

<p>As you unfurl the Scroll and begin to read its ominous contents, the Baron struggles to his feet. Word for word he echoes the prophetic verse.</p>
<blockquote class="poetry"><p>
When the full moon shines o’er the temple deep,<br />A sacrifice will stir from sleep<br />The legions of a long forgotten lord.<br />When a fair royal maid on the altar dies,<br />The dead of Maakengorge shall rise<br />To claim their long-awaited reward.
</p></blockquote>
<p>‘You must save her, Lone Wolf. You must prevent the sacrifice.’ The Baron’s voice is choked with emotion.</p>
<p>‘Save who? Who must he save?’ questions Captain D’Val, as he tries to calm the distressed Baron.</p>
<p>‘My daughter, Madelon. Barraka has found the Dagger of Vashna. He plans to sacrifice my daughter upon the altar of Maaken to release the undead of Maakengorge.’</p>
<p>The Baron explains that during the Age of the Black Moon, King Ulnar of Sommerlund killed the mightiest of all the Darklords, Vashna, with the Sommerswerd, the sword of the sun. His body and the bodies of all his soldiers were hurled into the bottomless abyss of Maakengorge. ‘He plans to lead the dead to victory first to conquer Sommerlund and then all of the Lastlands,’ he says in despair.</p>
<p>You stare at the Baron in stunned silence. If Barraka completes the sacrifice, all is lost. What mortal army can stand against a legion of the dead?</p>
<p>Captain D’Val ushers you from the chamber and closes the door. ‘I feared he was insane, but your Scroll confirms my worst nightmare. He speaks the truth!’</p>
<p>As the dreadful significance of the verse begins to sink in, your thoughts are broken by the shrill blast of a war-horn. Captain D’Val strides over to an arrow slit and peers out across the plain.

You begin to realize what must have happened to you. The fungi spores were making you hallucinate; the Tunnel Fiend existed only in your mind, it was nothing more than an illusion. Unfortunately, any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you lost in combat with this mere illusion cannot be restored: you inflicted the wounds on yourself, striking your body against the jagged tunnel walls.</p>

<p>The lock is rusty and stiff, but eventually it gives, and the door opens. You enter a narrow passageway that descends to another door fifty feet away. You order your men to go on ahead while you secure the door. It takes a great effort to force the lock closed. You hear the hollow <i>click</i> of the lock, but this is echoed by a click far louder. A trap has been sprung. The floor opens in the centre of the passage and swallows all your men, screaming with terror, into the void below. With fear rising in your throat, you race to the edge and peer into the inky black pit. The walls are sheer and its depth unknown. A cold breeze on your face and the eerie sound of wind whistling through the chasm is all that meets your desperate stare. With heavy heart, you bid a silent farewell to your lost men and hurry towards the distant door.</p>

Your horse collides with the flank of a bandit steed, hurling it and its rider to the ground. You reel in the saddle and are unable to avoid a spear thrust that opens a wound in your thigh.

<p>You wait, and when you are sure that the coast is clear you step back into the tunnel and press on, taking care to keep well in the shadows. You finally reach a point where the tunnel emerges into daylight. To your left, a dense copse has been cut back from the entrance, and wagon tracks lead to a timber gantry above a mound of ore. The men and the guards who passed you are now at the gantry, but they fail to see you sprint from the entrance and dive into the trees.

Three charge straight at you, their battle-cries loud and savage. You draw your weapon and strike, beheading two of the dark-skinned warriors with a single blow.

Cavalry are pouring onto the plain from all sides, grouping up into battalions in preparation for the advance. Columns of foot soldiers in bright scarlet armour march through their ranks, herding a frightened wall of people before them.</p>
<p>‘They’re Ruanese!’ cries D’Val, his hand shielding the light from his eyes. ‘That cur Barraka; he’s using them as a shield!’</p>
<p>All around you, the captain’s men have drawn their bowstrings, awaiting his signal to fire. But it is an order he dare not give. Suddenly a hidden catapult hurls a massive black rock through the air, straight towards the barricade. You stare in horror as it bursts into flame and disintegrates, showering a rain of blazing oil on everyone beneath. The soldiers cannot evade the deluge, and many are badly burnt before the flames are smothered. A battle-cry resounds from the enemy ranks: the signal to attack. The Ruanese are pushed aside and trampled by the onrush of scarlet warriors who now race towards the barricade.</p>

Many of them stumble and fall, but their leader beats them forward with the flat of his battle-axe. He is an ugly brute dressed in a heavy brass hauberk. As the first of the enemy smash into the shield-wall, he screams a deafening war-cry. A numbing thunder of blows rains down as the bandits hew and slice into your line. The fight is bitter but the wall holds firm, as your men bravely defend themselves.</p>

He has a shield in one hand and a longbow in the other; it is Captain D’Val.</p>
<p>He reaches you, breathless from his run, and draws an arrow from his quiver. The Warhounds, tired of their victim, are in search of fresh sport and are turning their attentions on you. D’Val aims and fires, drawing another arrow as soon as his bow is empty. Warhounds tumble and crash to the ground around you, felled by D’Val’s deadly shafts. The captain grabs you by the arm and swings you over his shoulder in one swift movement, before carrying you back to the barricade. Others run forward to help him, but the bandit archers are now in range and the men are forced back by a hail of arrows. The red shafts whistle past on all sides. Finally you reach the barricade; a wagon is pulled aside and you are carried through the open gap.

There are plates and goblets of gem-encrusted gold, necklaces of turquoise, pearls, and statuettes of marbled jadin, a rare and precious stone. You marvel at their beauty but decide against taking them for they are heavy and of little practical use. Then you notice a soft leather bag beneath the gold plates.

<p>From all along the forest edge, groups of bandits emerge from the trees, whipped and scolded by their bullying sergeants for allowing you to escape. This spurs you to quicken your pace, and you cover the first hundred yards with ease. Then arrows begin to fall around you. You duck and weave, making yourself a difficult target for the archers, and gradually the falling shafts dwindle in number. You smile at their futile attempts to stop you, but your confidence is soon shaken by a pack of snarling Warhounds breaking out of the woods to your right; they are off the leash and hungry for blood. You are less than five hundred yards from Ruanon, but the Warhounds are closing in.</p>

<p>You turn the key and push open the iron door. Immediately, a loud hissing fills your ears, like steam escaping from a geyser. A cat-like creature leaps at you from out of the darkness knocking you to the ground; its eyes glowing with a green fire and its fetid breath scorching your face—it is an Elix! As you struggle to free yourself from its powerful fanged jaws, more of these creatures bound through the open door and attack your men. You cannot evade combat, and you must fight this beast to the death.</p>

<p>You follow the tunnel for three hours before arriving at a great hall where several tunnels, all at different depths, meet up. A series of wide stone ramps connect each tunnel to those immediately above and below. Four levels below you, teams of men are pushing wagonloads of ore. Others, dressed in red armour, stand guard over the wagon-pushers and urge them on with whips and curses.</p>
<p>The tunnel in which you now stand is on the highest level. You realize that the only way you can proceed is by descending the ramp to a tunnel on a lower level. To your dismay, you notice that each of the ramps is guarded by armed men. Inching forward, you peer over the edge of the ramp; two guards are sitting near the tunnel entrance below. They are laughing and giggling and pointing at an empty wine flagon that lies at their feet. After watching them for several minutes, you decide they are probably too drunk to notice you. You decide to make a dash for the tunnel.</p>

He is a hard-faced warrior with eyes as black as coal, his armour tarnished with the blood of his dead horse. He raises his spear and stabs at your chest. You cannot evade combat and must fight him to the death.</p>

<p>Three Sommlending soldiers come to your aid. Their swords slice into the evil Warhounds until both dogs stiffen and die, and you thankfully stagger to your feet and try to assess the situation as the battle rages all around. Sommlending soldiers still man the barricade, forming in groups that hold firm where the wall does not. Spears and arrows arc through the sky piercing metal, wood, and flesh. Men fall from their horses, horses scream and bolt, and the dead and the wounded lie everywhere.</p>
<p>The Warhounds have been driven back upon the spears of their masters, who now advance behind a wall of shields. To your right, a bandit warrior is trying to jump his horse across the barricade, but the animal is wounded and near to death.

<p>You step over the dead warrior and call about you a handful of your men. The enemy have surrounded your horses, and you must act quickly if you are to save them from being taken. You lead a charge through the ruins, piercing the enemy line. They falter and flee back into the darkness. However, by the time you have reached the temple perimeter, only eleven of your horses remain—the others have vanished.</p>
<p>After much thought, you decide to choose ten rangers to continue the mission with you, sending the remainder of your company back to Sommerlund to report what has happened.

In seconds, there is a crack of slate and stone as part of the outcrop crumbles away and falls into the gaping mine shaft.

<p>Oren Vanalund is the fifteenth baron of Ruanon, a noble warrior of royal lineage, and fifth in succession to the throne of Sommerlund. This once proud and chivalrous warlord now lies upon the cold stone floor of the chamber, red-eyed and whimpering like a frightened dog. ‘He has lost everything,’ says D’Val quietly. ‘Barraka has destroyed his castle, his land, his town, and his family. His sons are dead, and his only daughter has been taken captive by Barraka himself. I fear the ordeal has turned his mind.’</p>

You hear his scream of pain ring out above the din of battle, but even though he is badly wounded he still attempts to rally his men. You stoop to take another arrow, but, to your horror, the dead soldier’s quiver is empty. Looking up you see two dismounted Vassagonian horsemen clambering across the barricade towards you. You throw down your bow and run to a large water cask defended by a stout Sommlending sergeant. The ground around the cask is carpeted with enemy dead.</p>
<p>‘Shoot the leader!’ you command, pointing towards the enemy officer. The sergeant aims and fires his bow with one swift and fluid movement. The arrow arcs through the battle-smoke and pierces the officer’s shiny breastplate. Slowly his cruel eyes flicker and close as he slips from the saddle, the shaft lodged deep in his heart.</p>

Forty brave soldiers, nearly half of the squadron that left Holmgard one month ago, now lie before you, and it is with heavy heart that your men set about the grisly task of burial.

You enter quickly to avoid the guards. Once they have passed by, you try to leave but find that you cannot re-open the stone panel from the inside. With a growing feeling of despair, you turn and follow the secret tunnel.</p>

<p>You are at the bottom of the cellar ladder when the trapdoor slams shut and you hear a bolt slide across and lock. You hammer on the trapdoor desperately trying to escape, but your captors cover the trapdoor with a heavy oak cask and keep guard in the room above. Four days pass before the lock slides back, but the hands that open the trapdoor are bony and fleshless.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your mission end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect348">348</a></h3>

<p>Less than fifty yards along the tunnel wall you notice a lever. Your Kai instincts make you naturally suspicious of this unusual feature, and you scour the floor looking for evidence of a trap. You find nothing, but a glance at the roof reveals the underside of a wide portcullis hidden between two beams.</p>
<p>You pull the lever and the portcullis falls, sealing off the tunnel behind you. To make sure you will not be followed, you smash the lever with a wedge of stone before continuing along the tunnel.</p>

<p>Judging by the smoothness of the stone floor and the condition of the ore wagons, you deduce that this gallery must service a major section of the mines. A fresh breeze can be felt blowing out of the west tunnel, and you sense that you must be near the surface.</p>
<p>Ruanon lies due west, the same direction as the ore wagon tunnel. You take a deep breath and emerge from the shadows, cross the gallery, and quietly enter the archway beyond.</p>

<h3><a name="sect350">350</a></h3>

<p>As Barraka dies, the wind suddenly rises in pitch and intensity, filling the temple with a mournful cry of despair. You feel the chill, malevolent spirit of Darklord Vashna engulfing you in an icy embrace, but you sense that he is powerless to harm you. The sacrifice has been foiled; he is doomed to lament for a victory that might have been.</p>
<p>Lying on the black temple floor is the Dagger of Vashna. As you pick it up and tuck it into your belt (mark this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item), the evil blue flame flickers and dies. As long as you possess this evil blade, Darklord Vashna and his legion of dead warriors will remain imprisoned in the Chasm of Doom.</p>
<p>You free fair Madelon from the altar and carry her through the corridors of the temple that lead up to the surface. As you emerge into the moonlit ruins, an astounding sight greets your eyes. Barraka’s warriors are running from the ghost city in all directions, closely pursued by an army of cavalrymen. The light of the full moon and the guttering torches that these horsemen carry, illuminates the sun-crest that bedecks their tunics. Word must have reached Holmgard for they are the Sommlending army, led by King Ulnar himself. Your countrymen praise your courage and daring, their strident cheers drowning the cry of Maakengorge, for once again you have proved yourself a true hero of Sommerlund. As you deliver Madelon into the waiting arms of her father, his overwhelming joy fills you with a sense of great achievement. You are indeed worthy of the title ‘Kai Lord’. You have succeeded in your perilous quest, but the epic saga of Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords—is far from complete. A new and deadly challenge awaits you in Book 5 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series entitled:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to any extra points given to you by your Kai Disciplines.</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. This number = Combat Ratio.</li>
<li>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio on the top of the chart and cross-reference to the random number you have picked. (E indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Enemy. LW indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Lone Wolf.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from Stage 3 until one character is dead. This is when the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either character falls to 0 or below.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="smevazn">To Evade Combat</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>You may only do this when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>You undertake one round of combat in the usual way. All points lost by the enemy are ignored; only Lone Wolf loses the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>If the book offers the chance of taking evasive action in place of combat, it can be taken in the first round of combat or any subsequent round.</li>
