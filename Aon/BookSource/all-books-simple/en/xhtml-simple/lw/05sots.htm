<div class="frontmatter">

 <p>You are Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords. A voyage to Vassagonia promises an end to the shadow of war. But hopes are soon shattered upon your arrival at Barrakeesh—a city full of treachery and death.</p>

 <p>In <strong><cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite></strong>, you are the quarry of a sinister foe, determined to kill you at all costs. Choose your skills and your weapons carefully. They can help you survive and aid you in the quest for a lost Sommlending treasure—a treasure that contains the secret of your destiny.</p>

 
     <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


    <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund, and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed them during a bitter war with your age-old enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>It is midwinter in your northern homeland and a mantle of snow lies knee-deep in the streets of Holmgard—the capital—when you are summoned from your monastery in the hills by a messenger bearing a scroll, signed and sealed by the hand of King Ulnar. You are surprised to read the King’s message, for it is a request for your help in solving an urgent problem of what he describes as ‘great diplomatic importance’. It seems a strange request to make of a warrior lord, whose skills are better suited to the field of battle than to parleying with foreign envoys. However, you obey the summons and upon your arrival at the capital, all is made clear.</p>
<p>The Zakhan of Vassagonia, the imperial ruler of this desert empire, has sent his most trusted envoy to seek a treaty of peace between your two countries, and you have been asked to sign the treaty on behalf of your country. The reason for this is easily apparent.</p>
<p>Less than a year ago, a renegade noble of Vassagonia called Barraka led his army of bandits in an attack upon the Sommlending province of Ruanon. This mining town and much of the surrounding land was overrun and destroyed. Many Sommlending lost their lives, and many more were enslaved and forced to labour in the mines of the Maaken Range. When the regular convoy from Ruanon failed to arrive at the capital, the king sent you to investigate. A great battle ensued in which you defeated Barraka in mortal combat. Without your courage and skill, the safety of Sommerlund and all of the Lastlands would have been placed in grave peril.</p>
<p>‘Your majesty, the Zakhan is gravely embarrassed by Barraka’s foul treachery, and is most anxious that our friendship and trust be restored. He begs that you send the Kai warrior, Lone Wolf, to sign a treaty of peace with him at the Grand Palace in Barrakeesh,’ whimpers the Zakhan’s emissary, as he kneels at the feet of King Ulnar.</p>
<p>The king rises from his throne, barely able to conceal his distaste for the fawning envoy. He turns his gaze to you and bids you follow him to the privacy of an antechamber.</p>
<p>‘I have no liking for this desert realm, Lone Wolf, but I like the prospect of war even less. The Zakhan is old and frail, and has no son to claim his throne when he dies. Barraka was but one of many ruthless nobles who wait like jackals for the chance to seize power, and I fear they grow too impatient to allow the Zakhan to die a natural death. The treaty may not guarantee peace with Vassagonia once the Zakhan is dead, but it will at least buy us precious time to strengthen our southern border.’</p>
<p>The king leads you to a window and points towards the harbour, barely visible through the falling snow. A Vassagonian galley lies anchored close to the harbour wall.</p>
<p>‘Go to Vassagonia, Lone Wolf. Sign the treaty and return quickly. Even with the promise of peace, I fear the shadow of war will fall upon us before the year is out.’</p>
<p>You wave farewell to Holmgard on this bleak midwinter’s day, feeling sure you will return before the thaw. But as you watch the spires of Holmgard disappear in the falling snow, you have no inkling of the shadow that awaits you in Vassagonia.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, and Kai Disciplines which you can now carry over with you to Book 5. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You may choose one bonus <a href="#discplnz">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure you have successfully completed; now read the <a href="#equipmnt">section on equipment</a> for Book 5 carefully.</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="camflage">Camouflage</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings. In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Camouflage’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hunting">Hunting</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Lord will never starve in the wild. He will always be able to hunt for food for himself except in areas of wasteland and desert. You are aware that most of Vassagonia is arid desert; should your adventure lead you into this desert, the opportunities for successful hunting may not arise. But this skill is still very useful for it also enables a Kai Lord to move with great speed and dexterity.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Hunting’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sixthsns">Sixth Sense</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Lord of imminent danger. It may also reveal the true purpose of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Sixth Sense’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="tracking">Tracking</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to make the correct choice of a path in the wild, to discover the location of a person or object in a town or city and to read the secrets of footprints or tracks.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Tracking’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="healing">Healing</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline can be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in combat. If you possess this skill you may restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to your total for every numbered section of the book you pass through in which you are not involved in combat. (This is only to be used after your <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) Remember that your <small>ENDURANCE</small> cannot rise above its original level.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill write ‘Healing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wepnskll">Weaponskill</a></h4>

<p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate is taught to master one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines, pick a number in the usual way from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this weapon, you add 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>0 = Dagger</li>
<li>1 = Spear</li>
<li>2 = Mace</li>
<li>3 = Short Sword</li>
<li>4 = Warhammer</li>
<li>5 = Sword</li>
<li>6 = Axe</li>
<li>7 = Sword</li>
<li>8 = Quarterstaff</li>
<li>9 = Broadsword</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean you set out on the adventure carrying that particular weapon. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventures. You cannot carry more than 2 weapons.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponskill in _______ +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points if this weapon carried’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindshld">Mindshield</a></h4>

<p>The Darklords and many of the evil creatures in their command have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Kai Discipline of Mindshield prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindshield: no points lost when attacked by Mindblast’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mndblst">Mindblast</a></h4>

<p>This enables a Kai Lord to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used at the same time as normal combat weapons and adds two extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Not all the creatures encountered on this adventure will be harmed by Mindblast. You will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlknsp">Animal Kinship</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to communicate with some animals and to be able to guess the intentions of others.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Kinship’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindomtr">Mind Over Matter</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Discipline enables a Kai Lord to move small objects with his powers of concentration.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mind Over Matter’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed Books 1–4 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, completion of Book 5 will raise you to the rank of Kai Master. This means that you will have acquired all ten basic Kai skills.</p>
<p>All of the Special Items that you have found and kept during your adventures, may then be used in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> ‘Magnakai’ series, which begins with Book 6 entitled <a href="../lw/06tkot.htm#title"><cite>The Kingdoms of Terror</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before leaving Holmgard on your voyage to the Vassagonian capital of Barrakeesh, you are given a <a href="#map">map of the desert empire</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may now enter this number in the Gold Crowns section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess. Remember you can only carry a maximum of fifty Crowns.)</p>
<p>You may take your pick of the following items (in addition to those you already possess, but remember you may only carry two weapons). You may take up to four of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Items). This potion restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Spear (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>2 Special Rations (Meals). Each of these Special Rations counts as one Meal, and each takes up one space in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Mace (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Shield (Special Items). This adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> when used in combat.<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>List the four items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You don’t need to make notes but you can refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dagger—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Spear—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Special Rations—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Mace—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Shield—slung over the shoulder when not in combat, otherwise carried in the hand.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty crowns.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at any time.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, you may already possess Special Items. Before you begin <cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite>, you may choose to leave any or all of these items in ‘safekeeping’ at your Kai Monastery in Sommerlund. Special Items in ‘safekeeping’ cannot be used, but neither can they be lost during your adventure.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Sommerlund and Vassagonia is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Whenever you kill a creature and search the body, you may take any Gold Crowns that you find and put them in your Belt Pouch.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your five skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat (unless you are in an area of desert where the opportunity for hunting is limited).<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast, to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 17.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Winged Devil’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (17 − 20 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as −3. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
<li>Winged Devil loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>

<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Kai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your mission is one of peaceful diplomacy—but beware! The desert empire of Vassagonia is notorious for being a land of deceit and treachery. Be on your guard at all times. Also, make notes as you progress, as you will find they will be of great help in future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will aid you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>If this is your first <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure, choose your Kai Disciplines with care—a wise choice and a great deal of courage should enable anyone to complete both parts of this adventure, no matter how weak his or her initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this book.</p>
<p>May the spirits of your Kai Masters guide you on your perilous adventure.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<h2><a name="part1">Part I</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>For twenty-five days, the Vassagonian galley sails on a steady course for its home port of Barrakeesh, with only a brief stop at the Durenese harbour of Port Bax to break a safe but monotonous voyage.</p>
<p>You use your time aboard the ship to good purpose, learning the Vassagonian language from the ship’s crew. They are only too eager to teach you, asking only in return tales of your adventures in the Lastlands—for many of the sailors, these are the most exciting stories they have ever heard. By the time you reach Barrakeesh, you have both mastered their language and won their respect.</p>
<p>It is early afternoon when the ramparts of the desert capital are first sighted on the horizon. You push your way through the cheering crew, and join the envoy at the prow of the ship. Beaming with pride, he hands you a telescope and invites you to view the land of his birth. The sight is indeed breathtaking. You stare in fascination at the golden domes, minarets, and green-tiled roofs shimmering beneath the desert sun, and marvel at the splendour of the Grand Palace, which dominates this magnificent city. Then you notice that from every golden turret of the palace flutters a long, black pennant. You ask the envoy of the meaning of the black flags. Horror floods across his face as he snatches the telescope from your hands. ‘By the spirit of the Majhan! He is dead…The Zakhan is dead!’</p>
<p>As the bad news spreads through the ship, you pray that the peace treaty will be signed and honoured by the Zakhan’s successor. However, the envoy is less than hopeful.</p>
<p>The harbour of Barrakeesh is deserted save for a handful of citizens clad in black, and the only sound that greets you is the toll of a funeral bell, echoing through the harbour on this day of mourning. Then a horse-drawn carriage enters the harbour square, escorted by the cavalry of the Palace Guard. It halts, and a dour man in turquoise robes steps out to meet you.</p>
<p>‘A thousand greetings, Lone Wolf, I am Maouk, and I welcome you to our city on behalf of my master, his most sublime magnificence, Zakhan Kimah.’</p>
<p>The envoy gasps upon hearing the name of the new Zakhan. He turns to speak, his eyes wild with fear. ‘It is a trap, you must…’</p>
<p>His warning is cut short by the blade of Maouk’s dagger. Suddenly, scores of black-clad warriors emerge from the shadows; they are Sharnazim, élite Vassagonian bodyguards. They close in, surrounding you on every side. You must act quickly if you are to survive this deadly trap.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stand and fight against these overwhelming odds, <a href="#sect36">turn to 36</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to surrender to Maouk and his warriors, <a href="#sect176">turn to 176</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>Breathless from the exertion of combat, you step back as the Elix finally collapses and dies. Slowly, its glass-green eyes mist over and become opaque like hard, cold jadin. Around the creature’s blood-spattered throat hangs a Gold Key on a chain. You quickly discover that the Gold Key opens the steel door of a strongroom at the far end of apothecary.</p>
<p>High upon a shelf, just inside the door, you find a small box that contains what you seek—the Oede herb. Within seconds of pressing the beautiful golden leaves to your wounded shoulder, a tingling sensation engulfs your whole arm. The numbness soon fades, and both your arm and shoulder are free of the horrific Limbdeath microbes.</p>
<p>Sufficient Oede herb remains in the box for one further application. It is a powerful substance that can be used against many deadly diseases or alternatively can be used to restore 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points if swallowed after combat. If you wish to keep the Oede herb, mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item. You should also restore the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points that were temporarily lost due to Limbdeath.</p>
<p>After dragging the dead Elix into the strongroom, you lock the steel door from the inside. You notice that there are in fact two doors to the strongroom: the one by which you entered and a smaller door set into the opposite wall. The Gold Key opens the lock of the new door, which leads to a narrow staircase beyond, dimly lit by flaring torches in wall brackets.</p>
<p>The climb is steep and arduous. You suspect that these steps are part of a secret route to the strongroom, and your suspicions are only confirmed when you arrive at what appears to be a dead end. A closer examination reveals a narrow bronze door set flush to the wall, plain in appearance except for a tiny key hole close to the floor. As you insert and twist the Gold Key, you are quietly confident that the bronze door will open.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect67">Turn to 67</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect3">3</a></h3>

<p>You search the bodies of the three vestibule guards and uncover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>1 Dagger</li>
<li>1 Sword</li>
<li>1 Potion of Alether (Increases your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 2 points for the duration of one fight.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also take the Blowpipe and the remaining Sleep Dart. If you decide to take them, mark them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as Backpack Items.</p>
<p>In the robe of the dead blowpipe warrior, you find a small piece of parchment upon which is written today’s date and the number 67. A smile creeps across your face as you realize that this is the number that will open the bronze door.</p>
<p>You hold your breath and twist the dial!</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect67">Turn to 67</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>You stoop to grasp the sword, but as your fingers close around the hilt, the second guard attacks.</p>

<h3><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>You are halfway round the tower when a section of the sandstone ledge suddenly gives way beneath your feet. Desperately you claw at the masonry, but the stone is old and disintegrates in your hands. You topple backwards and fall to your doom in the palace gardens below.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your escape and your life end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>You release the bowstring, and the arrow arcs through the air towards your target. However, you have misjudged the range, and it falls short and shatters on the cobblestones of the harbour square, alerting Maouk’s men to your whereabouts. You prepare to take flight, but the small boat is quickly surrounded, and you are forced to surrender.</p>
<p>As the black-clad Sharnazim drag you along the harbour wall, you fear that your life is about to come to a sudden end.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect176">Turn to 176</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>You channel all your Kai skill into detecting the number that will open the door; it is a strenuous task, and one that demands great concentration. Gradually, the image of two numbers—six and seven—begin to form in your mind. The image is hazy, and you’re not sure if the number is sixty-seven or seventy-six. You are exhausted by your efforts, and they have cost you 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Deduct these from your current <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total before choosing between the two possibilities.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to choose sixty-seven, <a href="#sect67">turn to 67</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to choose seventy-six, <a href="#sect76">turn to 76</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect9">9</a></h3>

<p>The guard begins to cough. He pleads with you to slacken your grip or he will choke to death. You ask him one more question: does he know where your confiscated equipment is? He says he does not know. Then, suddenly, he elbows you in the chest and breaks free. You are winded, but you are determined to stop him from escaping.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect78">Turn to 78</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect10">10</a></h3>

<p>The Sharnazim surround you and drag you to your feet. They take your Backpack, your Weapons, your Gold Crowns, and all your Special Items. (Make all the necessary adjustments to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, but note your lost possessions elsewhere in case you find them again later.) Your hands are tied with wire, and you are frogmarched back to the plaza. A carriage is waiting. As you are thrown in head-first, Maouk climbs aboard and, gloating with triumph, gives the command: ‘Back to the Grand Palace. The Zakhan awaits his prize.’</p>
<p>You struggle to free yourself from the wire that cuts into your wrists, but Maouk is quick to see the danger. He grabs your arm and forces a dart into your skin. As sleep numbs all your senses, the last sound you hear is Maouk’s wicked laughter.</p>

<p>You force yourself along the canal, which is thick with green and black scum, clotted with a hideous variety of filth and debris. Huge cockroaches crawl in and out of the cracked ceiling. The vile water is waist deep, and as the surface scum breaks, a cloud of putrid gas wafts up and engulfs you. The stench is appalling; choking, you cover your mouth and nose with the edge of your Kai cloak. A sudden splash warns you that Maouk’s men are not far behind so you quicken your step.</p>
<p>You have waded only a few yards when you hear a soft rustling noise. You freeze. It is the unmistakable sound of scaled skin slithering softly over stone. Fear turns to blind terror as you catch your first glimpse of the creature now advancing towards you.</p>

<p>You step into a perfect hemisphere. The walls of the chamber curve smoothly into the ceiling, where a small window casts a splash of light across the floor. There is a large circular dais in the centre of the room laden with incense burners, decanters, quilts, scrolls, cloaks, urns, and all kinds of fruit and sweetmeats. A drawer catches your eye, protruding from beneath the lip of the dais; you recognize the contents. You have found your confiscated equipment. Restore to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> all the Backpack Items, Special Items, Weapons, and Gold Crowns you lost when you were imprisoned.</p>
<p>Elated by your discovery, you resolve to escape from the Grand Palace as quickly as possible. There is only one other door, apart from the one by which you entered the chamber, which is set into the north wall.</p>

<p>The tunnel is dark and shadowy. Much of it is in a poor state of repair, and many cracks and fissures scar the walls. You must search for one large enough in which to hide.

<h3><a name="sect16">16</a></h3>

<p>You rush into the cellar and bolt the door. Pressing your ear to the gnarled timber, you listen intently to the noise of Maouk’s angry soldiers. They have entered the building and it will only be a matter of time before they notice the cellar door. You cast your eyes around the room. It is empty except for a Coil of Rope and a Tinderbox. Then you notice that there is another way out of the small stone room—an iron grille in the centre of the floor. However, the horrible stench rising from it turns your stomach.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to leave the cellar by the grille, <a href="#sect51">turn to 51</a>.</p>

<p>It takes a long time for the fear and nausea to subside, but you push on through the slimy water, almost oblivious to your dreadful surroundings. Eventually you reach a junction where a wider tunnel crosses your path.</p>

<p>The cell door does not open again until the sun has dipped below the peaks of the Dahir Mountains. You prepare yourself to meet the Zakhan, to demand your immediate release and safe passage back to Sommerlund, but it is not only the Zakhan who awaits you in the Grand Hall. He has a guest who has travelled many miles for this special meeting. His name is Haakon. He is a Darklord of Helgedad.</p>
<p>Unarmed and helpless, you are forced to kneel before the Darklord. With wicked relish, Haakon squeezes the life from your body with his own hands.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and all hopes for your country end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect19">19</a></h3>

<p>You raise the hood of your Kai cloak in order to keep your face in shadow as you approach the guards. They eye you suspiciously but are obviously reassured by your mastery of their language. You pretend to be a merchant whose goods have been confiscated and ask to be allowed to plead your case to the Judicar of Barrakeesh. The guards chuckle to themselves, and then demand two items from your Backpack before they allow you into the Grand Palace. They wink at each other, for they know that the Judicar never returns confiscated cargoes. They think you will be thrown in the palace cells for your insolence, like every other aggrieved merchant who has tried to plead for justice.</p>

<p>As you start to climb, two Sharnazim warriors suddenly emerge from the insect-choked tunnel. They lunge at you, their hands outstretched, their fingers hooked to claw at your legs and drag you down. You kick out and strike one of the cruel-faced men beneath the jaw. He clutches at his throat and gives a gurgling cry as he falls backwards into the slimy water.</p>
<p>You reach the stone trapdoor, but the other warrior has unsheathed his scimitar and has begun to climb the ladder; he no longer intends to capture you alive. Pressing your shoulder to the cobwebbed trapdoor, you push up the heavy stone and scramble out to find yourself in a noisy alley, crowded with people and market stalls. The sewer hole itself is close to a wicker table stacked high with bundles of torches.</p>

The people are kneeling in front of a pulpit where a holy man, dressed in flowing robes of black and gold, reads aloud from a gem-encrusted book. Behind him, the face of the late Zakhan, immortalized in a tapestry suspended from the roof by huge silken cords, looks down on the mourners.</p>
<p>The congregation is rapt in prayer, and nobody sees you enter. The ceremony soon comes to an end, and you are able to slip past Maouk’s men as the mourners flood into the streets.</p>

<p>A slippery ladder disappears into the dark, stench-filled shaft. You gulp a lungful of air and climb down, locking the trapdoor behind you. When you finally reach the bottom of the shaft, your worst fears are confirmed.</p>
<p>You have entered the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i>, the main drainage sewer of Barrakeesh. You recall one of the crewmen aboard the galley, an old man nicknamed ‘The Stink’ because he smelled so much, having been sentenced to one year’s imprisonment in the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i> for a crime he did not commit. Peering along the gloomy tunnels, you wonder how he survived for so long in this dank, filthy sewer.</p>

<p>Hurrying down the steps and away from the Bath Hall, you enter the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">‘Saadi-tas-Ouda’</i>: the Square of the Dead. Jet-black flagstones cover the square, each with a long iron spike set deep into its centre. From the Bath Hall steps, the square resembles the back of a massive iron porcupine, but when you reach the base of the steps, you realize that the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Saadi-tas-Ouda</i> is in fact far more sinister.</p>
<p>Stuck on top of each spike is a human skull—all that remains of pirates, murderers, traitors, and thieves who have been sentenced to death. The grisly display serves as a warning to others never to defy the law of the Zakhan.</p>
<p>As you reach the far side of the square, you brush against a spike. Fresh blood is smeared across the arm of your tunic, staining it dark red. You raise your eyes, cursing at your misfortune, but you are shocked into silence by the sight before you.</p>

<p>The temperature rises steadily until you are bathed in sweat. Ahead, you see a chamber filled with steam that rises from its bubbling floor. You are about to enter the chamber when you catch a glimpse of the danger awaiting you; the stone walkway ends abruptly, only a few yards into the chamber. Ten feet below, lying before you like the surface of a huge bubbling cauldron, is a <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">tar-sorkh</i>: a mud geyser.</p>
<p>These geysers are common in Vassagonia. Much of the desert empire is unstable, but although it is subject to constant earth tremors, it rarely results in great destruction. The Vassagonians call these tremors: <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">‘Tasa-Dophiem’</i>, which means ‘The Wrestling Gods’.</p>
<p>This particular mud geyser has been put to practical use. It provides a constant source of heat for the dwellings built over the chamber. The steam from the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">tar-sorkh</i> rises into a pair of huge, circular chimneys in the domed ceiling, which in turn feed heat to the buildings above. Your only way out of this chamber is by climbing one of these chimneys. Although there are no ladders, the rock-hewn chamber wall offers many footholds.</p>

You are elated by your find but disappointed to discover that the case contains only one Arrow.</p>
<p>Across the harbour square, close to Maouk’s carriage, you notice a small, white-walled shop where a row of green glass flagons line a balcony on the first floor. You draw the bowstring to your lips and take careful aim; it is a difficult shot, and you have only one chance.</p>

<p>The door is unlocked, and for a moment your heart sinks; if this room is the Imperial Apothecary where the Oede herb is kept, why is the door not locked and guarded? Anxiously you slip inside and survey the interior.</p>
<p>It seems to be an apothecary. Glass retorts bubble and steam over jets of blue flame, and strange fluids pass back and forth through a crazy maze of tubes and tunnels. Hundreds of herb jars line the far wall, and ten large copper urns, each full of rainbow-coloured powder, hang suspended from the soot-blackened ceiling. You begin searching through the herb jars, and suddenly you discover why the door was left unlocked. Creeping slowly towards you is the cat-like creature that guards the apothecary.

In its north wall is set a great wooden door, covered with engraved bronze plaques and studded with bronze nails. There is a curious lock set into the middle of this door, encircled by a beautiful carving of a long-tailed scorpion. A closer look at the lock reveals a series of Vassagonian numerals, numbered 1 to 200, engraved in the lock. You recognize the design: it is a Cloeasian combination lock.</p>

The guard is too engrossed in beating an unfortunate slave who has dropped a basket of fruit to notice you sprint across the gardens and leap into the shadow of a tall, arched kitchen window.

<p>Instinct tells you that you have entered the chambers of the upper palace, the sumptuous private enclave of the Zakhan. You walk upon glistening tiles of opal and platinum, past sculptures and statues of pure gold. The door of solid amethyst ahead seems plain in comparison to the breathtaking splendour of this private world. Beyond the door lies another unique and startlingly beautiful world: the arboretum. A circular, cathedral-like arena spreads out below you, the green velvet canopy alive with the sound of bird song. Trees of every colour, shape, and size flourish in the deep, dark soil of the floor. The Zakhan’s arboretum houses a specimen of every tree that grows in Magnamund, and many species that are now extinct elsewhere. As you walk the wrought iron balcony which encircles the arboretum, you recognize the leaves of a Sommlending oak. You feel a sudden wave of homesickness, but it does not make you despair; rather it renews your determination to escape from this hostile, sun-bleached land.</p>
<p>At one of the exits from the arboretum, you discover a Quarterstaff propped against the wall. (If you wish to take this, remember to mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.) The desire to escape urges you on as you leave the arboretum and hurry through a network of lavish corridors and empty, deserted vestibules.

<p>From the top of the staircase, hidden by the shadow of a pilaster, you stare down on a sight that freezes your blood with terror.</p>

<p>You part the curtain of beads hanging in the doorway and enter the cool interior. The lifeless arm that hangs limply by your side has taken on a bluish hue. Fear returns; you must find the Oede herb to cure the disease, or you will lose the whole limb and possibly your life.</p>
<p>A woman appears from the shadows of the counter. She has piercing green eyes and her red hair is raised, bound round with rings of jadin. ‘Welcome, Northlander,’ she says, in a voice both soft and clear. ‘How may I serve you?’</p>
<p>You hesitate before replying, ‘Oede.’</p>
<p>She narrows her eyes and casts a glance at your injured arm. ‘I cannot help you,’ she says sorrowfully. ‘Oede is now a very rare and precious herb. I would have to sell my shop and all my possessions in order to buy just one small pouch of Oede. There is only one man in Barrakeesh rich enough to possess this herb—the Zakhan.’</p>
<p>Sweat breaks out upon your brow as your fear grows. ‘What little Oede there is,’ she continues, ‘is kept in the Grand Palace under lock and key.’</p>
<p>You ask if there is any other herb that can cure your arm. She shakes her head from side to side. ‘Only Oede will cure Limbdeath—and you can only find that in the strongroom of the Imperial Apothecary.’ She reaches behind the counter and brings forward three glass bottles, each containing a coloured liquid. ‘They will not cure you, but they will dull the pain in the last few hours.’</p>

<p>You wake up in great discomfort; every muscle of your body feels knotted and bruised. You force open eyelids clogged with dried sweat, and look with dread at your wretched surroundings. You are lying on the hard stone floor of a prison cell. Over by the far wall, beneath a window criss-crossed with iron bars, is a low wooden bunk covered in filthy rags. Cockroaches, some the size of field mice, scuttle along a foul-smelling gutter that disappears into a grating in the floor. (Erase from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> all Weapons, Special Items, Gold Crowns, and your Backpack and all its contents, but note them down elsewhere in case you should find them again later.)</p>
<p>You discover that your hands are free and slowly pull yourself upright into a sitting position, resting your back against the cell door. A faint draught from the corridor outside provides the only relief from the stifling heat and bad air of the cell. In the distance you can hear footsteps approaching. Then there is a jangle of keys and the creak of hinges. A door closes with a dull thud. More footsteps; they are getting louder. They come to halt outside the cell door and a loud voice bellows out: ‘Sleeping on duty, Sefrou? You’ll wake up on the other side of this door if the captain catches you!’</p>
<p>The chair scrapes along the ground, and a startled voice, full of indignation, replies: ‘Curse you, Hadj! The Zakhan doesn’t want the Northlander taken to the Grand Hall until sunset. You’ve cheated me of two hours sleep.’</p>
<p>‘Shut up, Sefrou,’ snarls the first voice, ‘and listen hard. I’ve just come from the armoury. Some interesting trinkets were found on the Northlander, worth a great deal of gold I’d say. Seems a pity to let them go to waste, eh?’</p>
<p>The two guards chuckle greedily and discuss at length the good time they will be able to have in the city, once they have sold your equipment.</p>
<p>‘I’ll take a peek at our friend,’ says one of the guards. ‘I wonder if he’s enjoying our hospitality.’</p>
<p>A spy-hole slides open above your head and you hear a gasp of shock. ‘He’s gone! He’s gone! By the Majhan, we’ll lose our heads!’ You suddenly realize that you cannot be seen so close to the door.</p>
<p>‘Let me see,’ hisses the other guard, eager to see for himself. You hear the <i>click</i> of a key in the lock; this could be your chance to escape.</p>

<p>You press on for about a mile until you can go no further: a huge iron grating blocks the tunnel. The decomposing carcass of a giant lizard has been washed up against the bars. Bones are clearly visible where the dead flesh has rotted or been eaten away. The bars are firmly fixed; it will be impossible to continue in this direction.</p>
<p>Close to the dead lizard, a narrow stone platform juts out from the wall. Beyond a platform, you notice a low arch leading to some stairs, ascending out of the sewer.</p>

<p>Having washed off the worst of the dirt, you clamber out of the bath and enter a small antechamber; the room is hot and arid and your clothes are soon as dry as bone. Beyond the antechamber is another hall, this time crowded with people, some seated, others standing, and everyone busy in conversation. These are the free baths of Barrakeesh and the citizens of the capital are justly proud of them. They are the envy of the other desert cities where water is scarce and precious. The citizens treat the baths as a forum, a place for meeting and talking with friends. Much of the conversation you overhear is about the new Zakhan; few speak well of him.</p>
<p>You wrap yourself in the large Towel and make your way through the crowd towards the main entrance. If you wish to keep the Towel once you are outside, you must mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as 2 Backpack Items, due to its size.</p>

Suddenly, there is the grate of metal as the portcullis slowly rises. The guards stand back to allow a troop of cavalry to leave the palace. As they gallop past, the horses kick up a huge cloud of dust, covering the luckless guards from head to toe. They cough and sneeze and run to a horse-trough to slake their dust-choked throats.

<p>You grit your teeth in anticipation of the moment when he sees that you are not Vassagonian, but he simply returns to his scroll, holding the parchment close to his short-sighted eyes. You smile as you realize that the man cannot see you clearly enough to know you are a foreigner.</p>

<h3><a name="sect104">104</a></h3>

<p>‘Take him!’ shouts Maouk. ‘But take him alive!’</p>
<p>You sprint towards the distant galley. The crew are still unaware of the desperate situation. They have not witnessed the murder of the envoy and are still oblivious to your peril. Before you can shout for help, a horseman cuts across your path, blocking your access to the ship.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the horseman, <a href="#sect20">turn to 20</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect105">105</a></h3>

<p>Your attention is drawn to a marble bust standing in an alcove, one of many standing along the south wall. A closer inspection of the bust reveals a hinge at the base of the neck. The head tilts backwards to reveal a tiny lever.</p>

<p>You crash onto the rider and pull him from the saddle, but you land badly and lose your grip. The courier is first to stagger to his feet; he unsheathes his sword and attacks before you have a chance to stand up.</p>

<h3><a name="sect107">107</a></h3>

<p>You concentrate all your healing skill on repairing your damaged lung. Gradually, the pain in your chest subsides and a warm glow spreads from the centre of your body, radiating out to your arms and legs. Your Kai skill heals the wound, but you are still greatly weakened by the loss of blood.</p>

<h3><a name="sect108">108</a></h3>

<p>Several yards along the new tunnel are more chutes, each covered by an iron grating. Streams of green water pour into the main course, giving off a choking and acrid vapour which attacks your throat and lungs. You wade past the chutes, but you lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to the effects of the corrosive gas. Make the necessary adjustments to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect112">Turn to 112</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect109">109</a></h3>

<p>You drop to the street below and run across the marketplace towards the hall. The building is full of people kneeling in prayer. You notice an avenue leading off to the right, which ends at an archway too narrow for more than one horse to pass. To your left, another alley leads down to the harbour.</p>

<h3><a name="sect110">110</a></h3>

<p>A gigantic creeping reptile hangs from the ceiling, gripping the stone with its long, curved claws. Its huge oval eyes flicker hungrily as it picks up the scent of live human flesh—your flesh! It is poised to strike, and you cannot evade its attack.</p>
<p class="combat">Kwaraz: <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 19   <small>ENDURANCE</small> 30</p>

<h3><a name="sect111">111</a></h3>

<p>You are feeling weakened by the heat and by the fatigue of combat, but your spirits are high after having beaten such a formidable enemy. You search the armourer’s body and discover 3 Gold Crowns and a Copper Key. If you wish to keep the key, put it in your pocket and mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.</p>

<h3><a name="sect112">112</a></h3>

<p>You soon reach a section of tunnel where the ceiling is much higher. A stone walkway lines the left wall, with steps at regular intervals. You pull yourself onto the walkway and begin to scrape away the worst of the slime that encrusts your legs.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Kai Discipline of Animal Kinship, <a href="#sect133">turn to 133</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect113">113</a></h3>

<p>The passage ends at a tree-lined plaza. You must find somewhere to hide; your fair skin and your Kai cloak and tunic make you stand out in the city crowd.</p>
<p>To your left is a small dwelling with a curious wooden sign hanging above the door, carved in the shape of a fish. To your right is a tavern. The sign above the tavern door seems oddly appropriate:</p>
<div class="signpost">THE HUNTED LORD</div>

<h3><a name="sect114">114</a></h3>

<p>You reach a point where the chimney is no longer a vertical shaft, but curves into a horizontal tunnel leading south. Although the heat is oppressive, the steam has cleared. Every nerve and tissue in your body seems agonizingly sensitive, and you progress along the narrow shaft with difficulty.</p>
<p>All hope of signing a peace treaty with the new Zakhan has vanished; your only concern now is to escape from this hellish sewer and somehow get back to Sommerlund as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You notice a square vent cover in the ceiling less than ten feet ahead. It is badly corroded, and you have to lie on your back and kick with both feet to force it open. The effort drains your last reserves of stamina, but you are rewarded with success.</p>
<p>By pure chance you have gained access to the one place in Barrakeesh you most needed to visit—the public baths.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect90">Turn to 90</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect115">115</a></h3>

<p>Placing your ear close to the keyhole, you hear faint but horrible sounds. Screams of agony mingled with hysterical laughter and heart-rending sobs. The crack of a whip and the creaking of a rack confirm your suspicions that a torture chamber lies beyond this door. The terrible sounds make you shudder, and you waste no time in hurrying away from the chamber by the north door.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect132">Turn to 132</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect116">116</a></h3>

<p>You climb the stone steps to a small chamber above the tunnel. Here, at least, it is dry, even though the foul sewer gas permeates everything. You follow a narrow passage, first to the west, and then to the south as it makes an abrupt left turn. Your heart sinks as you see a dead end loom ahead.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search for a hidden exit, <a href="#sect33">turn to 33</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect117">117</a></h3>

<p>The twisting alley comes to an end in a small garden square flanked on three sides by tall, domed houses, all with first-floor balconies. Wrought-iron grilles reinforce every window and door.</p>
<p>You are near the top of a heavy wooden trellis that hangs below a balcony, when Maouk’s men burst into the square. Many are armed with heavy bronze crossbows.</p>
<p>‘Surrender, Lone Wolf!’ shouts Maouk. ‘Or my men will pin you to the wall!’ The situation is hopeless; at such short range, the Sharnazim cannot fail to hit you. Cursing your misfortune, you leap to the ground, landing at the feet of Maouk. ‘You are brave, Kai Lord,’ he snarls. ‘But you will need more than bravery to save you now!’</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect176">Turn to 176</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect118">118</a></h3>

<p>The guard raises the blowpipe to his lips. His cheeks swell, and then there is a sharp hiss warning you that another tainted needle speeds towards your head.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Kai Discipline of Hunting, add 2 to the number you have picked. If you have reached the Kai rank of Warmarn or higher, add 1 to the number.</p>

<h3><a name="sect119">119</a></h3>

<p>You catch both guards totally by surprise. Do not deduct any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you may lose in the first 3 rounds of combat, due to the surprise and ferocity of your attack. You must fight both guards as one enemy.</p>
<p class="combat">Palace Gate Guardians: <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 16   <small>ENDURANCE</small> 30</p>

<h3><a name="sect120">120</a></h3>

<p>The dagger hisses through the air and thuds into your chest. You gasp at the sudden pain, clawing at the hilt of the dagger with trembling hands in your panic to draw out the deadly blade. As you stagger backwards, the guard rushes forward, a smile of triumph spreading across his ugly face. You wrench the blade free and turn it on the guard as he dives towards you. He sees the danger but far too late—the blade has already pierced his heart.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect22">Turn to 22</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect121">121</a></h3>

<p>From out of the gloom, three Sharnazim warriors suddenly appear. The razor-sharp edges of their swords glint in the darkness; thirsty blades gasping for your blood.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the warriors, <a href="#sect60">turn to 60</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to evade them, you must turn back and swim across the sewer vault. <a href="#sect84">Turn to 84</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect122">122</a></h3>

<p>The heavy wooden door is reinforced with bands of black iron, held in place by huge bronze studs. You turn the handle, only to find the door is locked.</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not have this Special Item, <a href="#sect26">turn to 26</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect123">123</a></h3>

<p>The noise grows louder. Suddenly the door latch rattles and a gruff voice growls out above the din: ‘Break it down!’</p>
<p>Shards of wood and twisted iron are scattered throughout the cellar as the sharp blade of a two-handed axe explodes through the door. The hinges burst from the wall and in run your pursuers, stumbling on the tangle of shattered timbers.</p>
<p>You spring forward, striking left and right, and bringing two men down before they even see you. The officer, a bull-necked warrior with a flat nose, elbows the others aside and attacks. You strike first, jarring the scimitar from his grasp with a well-aimed blow to his wrist. He bellows like an ox but attacks again, a long-bladed dagger clenched in his uninjured hand.</p>

<h3><a name="sect124">124</a></h3>

<p>You leap from the window ledge and crash feet-first into the guards, bowling them over with the surprise your attack. You fight with speed and skill, killing three soldiers before they can regain their balance. However, the noise of combat alerts the mess hall, and a dozen more of the Zakhan’s soldiers join the battle. You are quickly overwhelmed by the sheer weight of numbers, and it is only their respect for your bravery and combat prowess that prevents them killing you on the spot.</p>
<p>You are disarmed and frog-marched to a prison cell, where you are left to await the Zakhan.</p>

<h3><a name="sect125">125</a></h3>

<p>The horse and its dead rider topple from the quayside and splash into the sea. The crew have drawn up the gangplank, forcing you to leap the gap. You fall short and land on the row of oars bristling from the galley’s side.</p>
<p>The wood is wet and slippery, and you have to fight to keep your balance. Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Kai Discipline of Hunting, add 2 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0–3, <a href="#sect50">turn to 50</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect126">126</a></h3>

<p>Keeping in the shadow cast by the tomb, you advance on the north gate. Only two soldiers stand guard were there would normally be twenty. Suddenly, the gate opens to admit a rider. He hands a scroll to the guards before galloping through the open gate. The guards read the scroll, seemingly unaware that the gate is still open.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Kai Disciplines of both Camouflage and Hunting, <a href="#sect170">turn to 170</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect127">127</a></h3>

<p>You walk back along the corridor to the junction in order to get a long run at the door—you know that if you barge the door in exactly the right place, you will tear loose the lock from the wall. Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 10.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is equal to or less than your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, the wall cracks and lock bursts open. <a href="#sect159">Turn to 159</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is greater than your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, the door remains locked. You sustain a badly bruised shoulder and lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. You must head off dejectedly along the other passage towards the stairs. <a href="#sect93">Turn to 93</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect128">128</a></h3>

<p>Your reach a domed sewer-vault where the tunnel widens. A chute descends from the centre of the chamber, ending just a few feet above the oily surface of the water; a mass of food scraps and offal floats beneath the chute, and the stink of rotting meat is overpowering.</p>
<p>You are about to step into the vault when you detect that the tunnel floor drops away. You freeze just in time to prevent yourself from stepping straight into deep water. The tunnel continues beyond the vault, but over twenty feet of putrid sewage lies between you and the other side.</p>
<p>The echo of a distant splash reminds you that the Sharnazim are still following. If you possess a Rope, you can try to catch it upon a long metal bar that protrudes from the side of the chute to pull yourself out of the water and swing across to the opposite tunnel.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a Rope and decide to use it in the manner described above, <a href="#sect29">turn to 29</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect129">129</a></h3>

<p>From the shadow of a doorway, you peer out across the harbour. The square is alive with Maouk’s soldiers. It will be far too dangerous to enter the harbour; you must find somewhere else to hide until it is safer.</p>
<p>Groups of soldiers are searching the houses that border the square, and you are forced to leave the doorway and run back along the alley. As you re-enter the marketplace, you run straight into a dozen Sharnazim led by Maouk himself.</p>

<h3><a name="sect130">130</a></h3>

<p>You snatch the Herb Pad from the dead warrior’s face (mark this as a Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) and cover your own mouth with this sweet-smelling pouch. The herbs inside neutralize the foul air, making it easier to breathe. Restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point.</p>
<p>The dead body sinks from view, and you hear the sound of more Sharnazim wading along the tunnel. You cannot outdistance them—you must hide.</p>

<h3><a name="sect132">132</a></h3>

<p>You move quickly and quietly along the north corridor and soon arrive at another arched passage that heads off to the west. A fierce glow can be seen in the distance, and you hear the hiss of red-hot steel as it is thrust into water and the <i>clang</i> of hammer on anvil—the unmistakable sounds of a blacksmithy.</p>

<h3><a name="sect133">133</a></h3>

<p>You recognize the tracks of a Kwaraz in the slimy mud of the walkway. Kwaraz are giant carnivorous reptiles. The number and varying size of the prints suggest that a whole colony of these loathsome creatures inhabit the tunnel. You decide it is far too dangerous to continue in this direction, and instead climb a narrow stairway that leads to a chamber above the tunnel. Here at least it is dry, although the foul sewer gas permeates everything. You follow a narrow passage, first to the west and then south, but your heart sinks as you see a dead end looming ahead.</p>

<h3><a name="sect134">134</a></h3>

<p>You use your Kai Discipline to force the creature away. The Bloodlug changes direction and jets towards a squid that has taken refuge in a large copper urn. You continue swimming but keep a watchful eye on the Bloodlug as it engulfs and devours the helpless squid.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect95">Turn to 95</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect135">135</a></h3>

<p>The air of the new tunnel is hot and humid, and as you press on, the putrid gas makes you increasingly nauseous. You are forced to stop—the vapour is burning your throat and causing painful stomach cramps. Suddenly a noise makes you forget your discomfort; you turn to see that one of Maouk’s men has caught up with you. He looms out of the darkness, his face covered by a pad of herbs.</p>

<h3><a name="sect136">136</a></h3>

<p>Once you have unlocked the door, you twist the handle and open it a few inches. You see a stair descending to a small chamber where a black-robed soldier is guarding a pair of iron gates. Through the bars you can see rows of weapons and suits of armour stacked in long racks. A sign fixed to the bars says:</p>

<p>Suddenly you realize just how hungry you are. You must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. You pass unseen through the exotic plants that grow everywhere in abundance. The gravelled path divides a lawn of strange, luxuriant, purple grass and leads to a magnificent fountain. A jet of clear blue water catches the sun, reflecting and refracting an eye-dazzling rainbow of colour. You gaze beyond the fountain to where the vaulting towers of the palace soar into the sky, and carefully note the positions of the doors and windows.</p>
<p>There are two entrances to the Grand Palace from the gardens; you can either go through the palace kitchens or through the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Vizu-diar</i>—the Zakhan’s trophy hall. However, only one of these entrances will lead to the Imperial Apothecary, and to the precious Oede herb stored there.</p>

<p>The guards pull open the door, and you spring into action. Your clenched fist strikes the first man beneath his bearded jaw, lifting him from the floor with the power of the blow. His sword drops from his hand and clatters to the ground close to your feet.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to pick up the sword, <a href="#sect4">turn to 4</a>.</p>

<p>You are so irritated by the crawling mask of insects covering your skin that you fail to see the rusty metal post sticking out of the water ahead. You walk straight into it and lose your footing. Instinctively, you grab at the post, but like everything else it is covered with sewage, as slippery as Kalte ice.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect94">Turn to 94</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect140">140</a></h3>

<p>The iron gates of the armoury are unlocked. You push open the left gate and wince as the shrill squeak of a dry hinge sends a shiver down your spine.</p>
<p>Inside, at the end of a long aisle, is a workbench, littered with spearheads, sword hilts, and all manner of armourer’s tools. In the midst of this tangled mess is a large, black, leather-bound book.</p>

<p>You hit the water and swim submerged until the pain in your lungs forces you to the surface. Sharnazim are running in every direction, trying to surround the quay and prevent your escape. Gulping another breath, you dive again and swim towards a cluster of small boats less than fifty yards away.</p>
<p>Through the clear blue water, it is easy to see the rubbish that litters the bed of the harbour; mementoes of all the merchant ships that have docked at the quayside. Clinging to one old anchor is a strange, jelly-like blob. A mass of short tubes sticks out from all its sides, and a long hook-like scoop hangs beneath its rubbery body.

<p>You set light to a tar-coated torch and hurl it down into the sewer-hole. There is a tremendous flash and roar; suddenly, all along the alley, plumes of flaming sewage explode skywards. The alley is transformed into a rush of shocked and screaming people, all scrambling to avoid the deluge of burning filth raining down on their heads. The torch has triggered a chain reaction in the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i>; the inflammable sewer gas has ignited—everywhere is panic and confusion.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration IX]</div>
<p>You run with the crowd through the sewage-stained alleys until you reach a busy market square, unpolluted by the blast. Your eye is caught by a sign hanging above the side door of a large hall:</p>
<div class="signpost">BARRAKEESH PUBLIC BATHS</div>
<p>You push open the door and slip inside.</p>

<p>You wade into the water, thick with scum, and try not to breathe through your nose. The glutinous mire is clotted with green and black filth, and with your every movement the surface cracks, releasing a vile gas. You cover your mouth with your Kai cloak, but the appalling stench makes you retch and choke. A loud splash behind you warns that Maouk’s men are not far away, and you quicken your step. At regular intervals, circular chutes disappear into the ceiling. Many are stained bright yellow, white, or reddish-brown. This section of the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i> passes beneath the Linen Quarter of Barrakeesh, where the Guild of Linen-weavers operate their fuller’s shops. The chutes dump waste dyes straight into the sewer, making the oily water even more garish in colour.</p>
<p>You spot a ripple in the water ahead. It moves nearer, the wake of a submerged sewer creature. Instinctively, you flatten yourself against the dye-stained wall as you feel the movement of water against your waist, and watch in fear and fascination as the ripple of water disappears into the tunnel. Suddenly, a fearful scream bursts out of the darkness; Maouk has lost one of his men. The terrible cries of the Sharnazim warrior chill your spine, but your instincts tell you to press on while you have the advantage. The channel soon reaches a junction where another tunnel heads off to the west.</p>

<p>As soon as you enter, the panel slides shut, and you are plunged into darkness. You advance nervously, your hand held before your face to part the cobwebs hanging in festoons from the low ceiling. You are a few feet away from what appears to be a dead end when you tread on a pressure plate, which activates another panel that slides back to reveal a small chamber.</p>

<p>You reach the door to the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Vizu-diar</i> without being seen, only to find that it is securely bolted from the inside. You are about to curse your bad luck when you notice a window set into an elaborately carved panel above the door; its iron shutter is open.</p>
<p>In spite of your injured arm, you successfully climb the nail-studded door and drop through the window into the silence of the trophy room. An eerie collection of stuffed heads lines the walls of this private chamber. Most are those of reptilian desert creatures, souvenirs of imperial hunting expeditions into the Dry Main. Among the snake-like trophies, and more gruesome, are human heads! They are ghoulish battle honours, the heads of enemy commanders slain in battle during the countless wars waged by Vassagonia.</p>
<p>You hurry out of the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Vizu-diar</i> and into a long marble corridor, where the walls are inlaid with veins of gold and pearls. It leads to a large hall where palace guards and brightly robed courtiers are walking to and fro, but a colonnade of statues provides all the cover you need to reach a distant staircase unseen. Stealthily, you sprint up the staircase to arrive at a junction where passages head off to the east and west. At the end of each is a door with a symbol engraved into the wall above. The symbol above the east door depicts a mortar and pestle; the symbol above the west door, an open book.</p>

<p>The corridor heads north but soon ends at a junction where another passage runs across from east to west. Cautiously, you peer around the corner, but there are no signs of any guards.

<p>Your keen eye falls upon a narrow fissure in the tunnel wall. The gap is near to the level of the scum and can barely be seen in the darkness. You squeeze inside, steeling yourself as the foul water rises up to your chin. The Sharnazim pass within inches of your hiding place, and you have to fight the urge to vomit as a wave of sewage laps your face. ‘He has taken the south tunnel,’ echoes an angry voice. ‘Quickly—don’t waste your time here!’</p>
<p>It seems an eternity before the Sharnazim retrace their steps and disappear back along the tunnel. With a sigh of relief, you emerge from the fissure, but catch your foot in something embedded in the silt of the tunnel floor and lose your balance.</p>

<h3><a name="sect152">152</a></h3>

<p>You press yourself against the weathered stone and try to avoid looking down at the courtyards and gardens of the palace, hundreds of feet below. You bite your lip and wait for the guards to pass, but they do not pass. It is nearly sunset, and they have come to shut the iron grilles of the palace windows. You hear the creak of dry hinges and the click of bolts—sounds that send a shiver down your spine. You realize that you are now locked out.</p>
<p>To your left, the ledge continues around outside of a dome; inside this is the mess hall. If you can only inch your way around the tower, you may be able to find an open window on the other side.</p>

<p>Maouk orders his black-clad troops to search the area, threatening them with death if they allow you to escape. You bite your lip and wait for a chance to run.</p>
<p>Creeping from one boat to the next, you reach a narrow flight of stone steps. At the top of the steps, beyond a small paved square, lies a maze of crooked alleyways that disappear into the shadows of the Thieves’ Quarter. You are less than twenty feet from safety when a cry echoes across the water: ‘There he is!’</p>
<p>You sprint along the deserted passage and climb a stairway into an open courtyard. The sound of hooves clattering on the cobblestones below urges you onwards. There are three possible exits from the courtyard: a high, nail-studded gate to the left; an alley to your right; and a straight, paved pathway that leads to an arch. You must make a quick decision for Maouk’s men are close at your heels.</p>

<p>You part the bead curtain that hangs across the doorway and enter the cool interior. The light is poor and the room gloomy, for the windows are obscured by sheaves of herbs and plants. You are studying a curious row of coloured bottles when a woman appears. She has piercing green eyes and her red hair is raised, bound with rings of jadin. Softly, she speaks to you.</p>
<p>‘Welcome, Northlander. I sense you are a warrior—or am I mistaken?’ As you hesitate to answer, she shrugs her shoulders and searches through a pile of parchments stacked on top of a wine casket. She blows away the dust before handing you a yellowed sheet. It is a list of merchandise, written in Sommlending:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potion of Alether (increases <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 2 for the duration of 1 combat)—4 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Potion of Gallowbrush (induces sleep for 1–2 hours per dose)—2 Gold Crowns</li>

<p>From the view, you judge that this window is set high up in the south wall of the Grand Palace. Far below you can see the buildings of the capital, in miniature clusters inside the white city wall. To the southeast lies Lake Inrahim, an immense salt-water plain that is completely dry and cracked. To the east, a road stretches across the causeway to the town of Chula, just visible on the horizon. To the southwest lie the barren, sun-scorched Dahir Mountains and the shifting ocean of sand known as the Dry Main.</p>
<p>The bars of the window are badly corroded; it would be easy to dislodge them. However, the drop of several hundred feet to the city below means that there is no hope of escape this way. You climb down from the table and hurry along the corridor.</p>

A man, dressed from head to toe in black, appears from behind the left-hand pillar and walks towards you.</p>

Thousands of tiny fragments of pearl and gold shimmer in the light of the evening sun, glancing rainbows of colour across the high marble walls. A group of palace courtiers ambles through the gallery, and you are forced to hide behind a huge pillar. You wait until their footsteps have faded into the distance before emerging into light.</p>
<p>All hope of signing a peace treaty has long vanished, and your only concern now is to escape from the Grand Palace and, somehow, return home to Sommerlund as quickly as possible. Hurrying out of the gallery, you follow the passage westwards and soon reach a junction where the passage turns abruptly to the north.</p>

<p>You landed in a heap on the hard marble floor of an antechamber, (you lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points) barely a few feet away from an armed soldier, who is guarding the doors to the palace armoury. He is startled by your dramatic entrance but quickly regains his senses and attacks.</p>

<p>Your desire to leave this treacherous city is overcome by your fear of losing your arm. You must get the Oede herb, even though it means you will have to enter the very place you are most anxious to avoid—the Grand Palace.</p>
<p>The alley follows a tortuous route through the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Mikarum</i>, finally leading you to the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">‘Horm-tas-Lallaim’</i>: the Tomb of the Princesses. Beyond the tomb, the Grand Palace rises like a massive white pantheon.</p>
<p>You suddenly recall a legend told to you by your Kai masters long ago: ‘The Nemesis of the Black Zakhan’. The Black Zakhan was a brutal tyrant, the cruellest of an evil lineage that ruled over the desert empire long ago. The barbaric excesses of his reign have never been forgotten in the Lastlands. The Grand Palace was built by his army of slaves, prisoners from countries he had conquered in war. The palace became his obsession; he personally oversaw its entire construction and punished the workers personally if there was the slightest delay. He butchered his subjects indiscriminately and in the most terrible fashion. His favourite form of execution was for the victim to be sawn in half from head to foot until the body fell in two pieces. However, it was the mass execution of the slaves who built the Grand Palace that made him infamous. He slaughtered every slave worker so that his enemies could never learn of the secret treasure chambers he had had constructed. Among the slaves were his only daughters, Kebilla and Sousse, who openly opposed their father’s cruelty and tried to prevent the executions. In a blind rage, he ordered that they should be the first to die.</p>
<p>It would have been better for the Zakhan, and for Vassagonia, if he himself had died that day. He lived for another two years, but his mind was unhinged by guilt, and he was tortured by self-loathing and despair. In the Grand Palace, the silence of the night was frequently broken by the Zakhan’s moans and cries, as he wandered from room to room looking for his daughters. When he died, he was laid beside them, here, in the Tomb of the Princesses.</p>
<p>From where you stand, you can see two entrances to the Grand Palace; a spike-topped gate in the north wall, and an arch in the west wall, blocked by an iron portcullis. The palace is usually heavily guarded, but there are very few guards today; most are searching for you in the city.</p>

<p>Judging by the direction of the sluggish flow, the right channel appears to head off to the north. The vast tide of sewage and garbage from the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i> is swept out towards the coast, until it emerges at Chiras, a village northwest of the capital. There it makes life both difficult and unpleasant for the poor local fishermen (especially during the summer months). If you take the north channel, you should eventually reach the coast.</p>
<p>The left channel heads south, running below the very heart of the capital. In the maze of tunnels that feed into the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i>, you should be able to find at least one exit to the streets above.</p>
<p>Straight ahead, the channel leads off to the west. It is by far the least fetid and contaminated of the three. During the voyage, you remember ‘The Stink’ telling you about the Grand Madani: a great aqueduct over forty miles long, which channels freshwater from the River Da into the city. As a result, the citizens of Barrakeesh, unlike the inhabitants of other Vassagonian cities, enjoy a lavish supply of fresh water. The west channel will lead to that water source.</p>

On this platform are several earthenware tuns: huge spice containers destined for the trading emporia of Ragadorn. You focus your attention on one of these tuns and concentrate all your Kai skill into making it move.

<p>You recognize the creature; it is a Kwaraz, a giant, creeping reptile. Kwaraz are native to the Maakenmire swamp, hundreds of miles to the west of Vassagonia, but they thrive in any hot, damp, and fetid environment, and it strikes you that the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i> sewer is an ideal breeding ground for these deadly beasts. The Kwaraz moves along the ceiling, gripping the stone with its long, curved claws—its oval eyes opening wider and wider.</p>
<p>Kwaraz are very susceptible to psychic power. By using your Kai Discipline of Animal Kinship, you persuade it that you are not at all appetizing, and it soon loses interest. You watch with a mixture of fear and fascination as the huge reptile disappears along the tunnel. Suddenly, a fearful scream bursts out of the darkness; Maouk has lost one of his men. A shiver runs down your spine, but your instincts tell you to press on while you have the advantage.</p>

<p>Upon a raised platform, carpeted with scarlet fur, sits the Vassagonian Emperor, Zakhan Kimah. He is robed in gold but devoid of all ornamentation. In his hand is an orb of black metal, and in his eye an ice-cold cruelty that chills your spine. The Zakhan is a man of awesome countenance, but he pales in the shadow of his companion.</p>
<p>Before him stands the cause of your terror. A helm as black as death itself hides the face, but the stench of decay and a hideous sepulchral voice betray the identity.</p>
<p>‘Give me Lone Wolf!’</p>
<p>It is the fell voice of a mortal enemy—a Darklord of Helgedad. As the Zakhan rises to his feet, you notice a flicker of doubt, or perhaps of fear, dim his cruel gaze, but he is quick to mask it. ‘He will be brought to you at sunset in exchange for the Orb of Death. It is agreed.’</p>
<p>‘You have the Orb,’ echoes the chilling voice. ‘Give me Lone Wolf!’</p>
<p>The Zakhan hides his fear well, but time is not on his side. The game of bluff he is playing is deadly. However, the fact that he has not yet been discovered is evidence of his powerful will, for you sense the Darklord is persistently clawing and probing at his mind.</p>
<p>‘You will get your Northlander, Lord Haakon,’ says the Zakhan, his voice curt with anger, ‘when you tell me why your servants defile the Tomb of the Majhan. You claim to have no need for gold and jewels—why then do you plunder the graves of our ancestors?’</p>
<p>A deathly quiet fills the hall; only the unnatural hiss of the Darklord’s breath disturbs the silence. ‘This land, this insignificant speck of sand, harbours two small thorns that prick our skin. We seek to remove them both—forever. The fledgling Kai, Lone Wolf, is the thorn that denies us Sommerlund. The Tomb of the Majhan hides the other thorn that threatens us—the accursed <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>.’</p>
<p>Your heart pounds as the words echo in your head. The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>! Suddenly, the reason why you have been enticed into a deadly trap becomes clear, and the sinister truth is revealed.</p>
<p>The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> is one of the oldest legends of Sommerlund. With the wisdom of the Magnakai, Sun Eagle, the first Kai Grand Master, instilled the disciplines into the warriors of the House of Ulnar, the bloodline of your king, that were to save your land from devastation at the hands of the Darklords. The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> was lost hundreds of years ago, but its wisdom was kept alive, handed down through generations of Sommlending warriors so that they could share the strength to resist their eternal enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>If the Darklords discover and destroy the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>, the secrets will be lost forever, and when you die, the Kai will become extinct. However, if you discover the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> first and deny the Darklords their prize, all the wisdom of the Magnakai will be revealed to you. Through its wisdom you will become strong, strong enough to reach the ultimate achievement for a Sommlending warrior—to become a Kai Grand Master.</p>
<p>However, the peril and the glory of the quest that lies ahead are distracting you from more immediate danger. To discover this danger and to begin the quest for the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>, turn to Part Two of <cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite>.</p>

<p>There is no reply to your first knock. You are about to knock again when the door opens a few inches and the red-rimmed eyes of an old woman stare out from the darkness. ‘Banedon!’ she exclaims, her voice hoarse and shaky. ‘Thank the gods it is you.’</p>
<p>She ushers you both inside and locks the door. The house is sparsely furnished, and what little is there is either damaged or broken. ‘They have taken him, Banedon, they have taken my husband—the men with the faces of the dead. Ten days ago. They came like shadows in the night.’</p>
<p>She breaks down, her frail body wracked by sobs. Banedon comforts her as best he can, but you sense he shares her bitter loss. The Drakkarim have taken Tipasa, of that there is little doubt. By now they will have made him tell everything he knows about the Tomb of the Majhan.</p>
<p>‘We will find him, I promise,’ says Banedon, wiping the tears from the old woman’s face, ‘but you must try to help us if you can. Tipasa always kept a diary of his travels—do you have it still?’</p>
<p>A flicker of hope shines in the old woman’s eyes. ‘Yes, it is here. He told me to hide it when the evil men came for him.’</p>
<p>She kneels at an empty fireplace and prises a loose brick from the chimney; a leather-bound book drops from its hiding place into her hand. She gives it to Banedon who studies the yellowed pages, his face lined in thought. You notice that the book is full of cryptic symbols, numbers, and pictograms.</p>
<p>‘They are drawn by the night stars,’ says Banedon, tracing his finger along the astronomical drawings. ‘They hold the secret, I know, but without my star charts we cannot hope to find the tomb.

<p>The Drakkar falls to his knees and makes a horrible rasping noise as he tries in vain to prise open his shattered death-mask. Your blows have staved in his helm, and the buckled metal has fractured his skull. You lash out with your foot and kick him from the outrigger, sending him spiralling down to Lake Inrahim to join the dwarf he murdered. But the dwarf is neither dead nor hundreds of feet below. He hangs by his foot, unconscious, snagged in the netting below the outrigger boards. You grab the dwarf’s leg and haul him to safety before continuing the fight.</p>

<p>You remove your Blue Stone Triangle from around your neck and press it into the indentation in the wall. It is a perfect fit. You hear the sound of stone grating on stone, and the door slowly opens to reveal a chamber. It is dimly lit, but you see that the thick dust on its marble floor is covered with innumerable footprints. As you enter, you catch sight of a rough stone throne, facing the wall on the far side of the chamber.</p>
<p>Behind you the stone door slides shut with unnerving speed.</p>

<p>Using the Copper Key, you unlock the door and hurry into the garden, not a moment too soon; as the heavy door swings shut you hear crossbow bolts ricocheting from the bands of studded iron.</p>
<p>The enclosed garden is filled with the fragrance of exotic shrubs and trees, which cluster around a sculptured pool of deep blue water. It is a beautiful sight, but you dare not stop to enjoy it. The Drakkarim and the palace guards know where you are, and you must keep moving if you are to escape them.</p>
<p>Beyond a tree-lined colonnade, a flight of steps ascends to a small portal in the wall of the upper palace. To your right, a leafy tunnel winds away into the trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>The voyage through the Koos is breathtaking. The <cite>Skyrider</cite> glides between the towers of rock that rise from the valley floor with fantastic and unearthly grandeur. Far below, sulphurous water bubbles from fissures in the orange ground and streams of hissing lava carve circular channels, which glow like moats of liquid fire. You watch the sky, but there are no signs of the enemy.</p>
<p>‘Ikaresh,’ says Banedon pensively. ‘ “The Eagle’s Lair”. That is where we will find Tipasa the Wanderer. It is the place of his birth and the home of his family. He roams the Dry Main, but he always returns to Ikaresh.’</p>
<p>It is late afternoon when you reach the hills beyond the Koos that overlook the town of Ikaresh. Banedon moors the <cite>Skyrider</cite> to a pinnacle of stone, and a rope ladder is lowered to the ground. It has been decided that you and he will enter Ikaresh on foot and locate Tipasa, while Nolrim and the crew wait in hiding for you to return—the sight of the <cite>Skyrider</cite> hovering above the mountain town would be sure to arouse unwanted interest in your arrival.</p>
<p>You and Banedon prepare yourselves for your mission by staining your skins with brown copalla berries and dressing in the grey and white robes commonly worn by the mountain people of this region. You bid farewell to Nolrim and set off across the barren hills.</p>

<p>A small, heavy-set merchant is hawking his wares from a stall set close to the archway. His small, beady eyes twinkle from beneath a ridiculously outsized turban. As you approach, he launches himself at you, desperately trying, with a flood of wild claims, to persuade you to buy his obviously inferior goods. He looks surprised when you interrupt him with your question. ‘Tipasa?’ he answers. ‘Yes, I know where he lives.’</p>
<p>He holds up a gaudy waistcoat of pink and orange sackcloth and offers it to you. ‘It would make a worthy gift for your esteemed friend,’ he suggests, his eyes continually glancing at your Belt Pouch. ‘Only 5 Gold Crowns, master.’</p>

<p>As you watch the Kraan-riders disappear into the darkening sky, a roll of thunder rumbles across the plain from Barrakeesh. The sound is threatening and full of brooding menace, as if the city itself were cursing your escape.</p>

<p>You whirl your feet away from the shining steel and narrowly escape being wounded as the axe bites inches deep into the polished stone floor. However, before the guard can strike another blow, you lash out and send the axe spinning from his hand. He screams, clutching broken fingers to his chest.</p>
<p>You turn and run towards an open door. The air is filled with the sound of pounding feet, for the palace guard are on full alert; together with the Drakkarim, they are now bent on finding and killing you as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Beyond the door, a bridge rises at a slanted angle over an enclosed garden, joining this part of the palace to a needle-like tower of white marble. At the entrance to the bridge, a narrow stair disappears into the garden below.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the pain subsides, but a new horror is taking shape before your eyes. Out of the darkness, a green whorl of vapour is forming slowly into the shape of a glistening, serpent-like monster. A grey mist issues forth from the Darklord’s mouth, floating towards the core of this horror, infusing it with the power of death. The serpent writhes and convulses as the grey mist fills its body, changing it from a dream-like illusion into a living nightmare. Two pinpoints of crimson glow from its eyes, as it slithers towards you.</p>

<p>You have prepared yourself for death and feel calm and relaxed. Suddenly, you feel your body engulfed by a mass of sticky fibres. There is a terrific jolt, which leaves you breathless and stunned.

<p>You have been caught by a net of sticky strands like a fly in a web. You rise into the sky towards the flying ship as quickly as you fell. Three bearded dwarves clad in bright, padded battle-jerkins pull you aboard an outrigger that runs the length of the hull. There’s no time to express your gratitude, for the small skyship is under attack from the Kraan-riders.</p>
<p>At the end of the outrigger, a dwarf is in hand-to-hand combat with a snarling Drakkar. He is losing the battle. As you rush to help him, another of the evil warriors lands in the centre of the craft, on top of the fortified platform.</p>

<p>The sun-sword tingles with power as you point it at the flame which hurtles nearer and nearer, its hiss becoming so loud that it drowns the noise of battle. You brace yourself for the moment of impact. The flame hits the Sommerswerd with a thunderous noise and is held there in a ball of liquid purple fire that burns at the very tip of the magical blade. Instinctively, you whirl the Sommerswerd around your head and cast the fireball back into the sky.</p>
<p>The Vordak shrieks with terror, but it is too late—its fate is sealed. The fireball consumes the Zlanbeast and its rider in a massive explosion of sun-like brilliance.</p>

<p>The Itikar shudders and frantically twists its head from side to side as the shriek rings out again. You sense that the great bird is in agony, racked by the Mindblast. As you glance over your shoulder, your stomach becomes knotted with fear—a Kraan is swooping down to attack. On its back is your adversary: a Vordak, one of the undead and a hideous lieutenant of the Darklords. As the Kraan streaks towards you, the Vordak spreads its red-robed arms and leaps from the saddle. It lands behind you, astride the Itikar’s back, its skeletal fingers sunk deep into your mount’s feathered flesh. The shock of the impact throws you forward, and the reins slip from your hands.</p>
<p>The giant bird screeches in horror and pain as the Vordak’s grip paralyses its spine. You must act quickly, for the Itikar is now plummeting towards the salt-plain of Lake Inrahim.</p>

<p>The Akataz is nearly upon you; you feel its fetid breath on your legs. Instinctively you dodge aside at the very second it leaps. It crashes muzzle first into a marble pillar. A howl of pain leaves its broken mouth as you step forward and strike a death-blow; it will never attack again.</p>
<p>You glimpse the grim silhouette of Darklord Haakon in the hall below, his spiked fist raised. A Drakkar appears as if from nowhere and advances, a sword held high above his skull-like helm. There is a deafening crack as a bolt of blue lightning streaks from a stone in the Darklord’s hand and comes hurtling towards you. The Drakkar lunges and wounds your arm (you lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), but he now stands in the path of the bolt.

It turns its head and fixes you with a cold black stare, but you sense that it is now no longer hostile.</p>

A spiked fist opens to reveal a glowing stone; blue flame smoulders around its surface, and you can feel the currents of power that radiate from its core.

<p>You learn that the dwarves were once the crew of a more conventional vessel, a merchantman that sailed the Tentarias of southern Magnamund. The Tentarias is a vast expanse of lakes and land-locked seas, which connect to form a continuous canal stretching nearly three thousand miles. They were created, as was the Rymerift of Durenor, by a massive landslide. Three years ago, the dwarves’ former captain, a dwarf named Quan, lost his ship, cargo, and crew whilst gambling at cards; it seems the unfortunate captain was unaware of Banedon’s true profession until it was far too late. As a result, Banedon became the dwarves’ captain, and ever since they have adventured with him across the lands and skies of Southern Magnamund. The <cite>Skyrider</cite> itself was given to Banedon by the Magicians of Dessi, in return for his help in defeating the Gagadoth—a monstrous creature that terrorized their land, over which their own sorcery could not prevail.</p>
<p>The <cite>Skyrider</cite> was travelling from Dessi on its way to Barrakeesh when you appeared. The dwarves have overheard your talk with Banedon and are excited by the prospects of a new adventure. They seem undaunted by the deadly dangers that it will certainly involve.</p>

<p>You see the young magician lower his staff, a trace of a smile on his pain-racked face.</p>
<p>‘Alas, I was too slow to shield myself,’ he says wryly, as you kneel at his side and free the spear that pins him to the floor. The wound is serious, and you hastily staunch the bleeding with strips of cloth from his dark blue robes.</p>
<p>The wizard then introduces himself. ‘I am Banedon, Journeymaster to the Guild of the Crystal Star,’ he says, his voice weak and shaky. ‘However, you need not introduce yourself, Lone Wolf, for only you would attract such company this far from home.’ He glances at the Kraan-riders swooping past the skyship on every side. ‘Help me to my feet—we must escape before they drag us from the sky.’</p>

<p>‘Do not worry, Lone Wolf,’ says Nolrim, the dwarf with the velvet satchel. ‘The captain will see us through.’</p>
<p>Banedon stands with his hand resting lightly on the glowing crystal, relaxed as if in a trance. His eyes are closed and a crackle of energy, like fine white lightning, traces an intricate pattern over his forehead and temples.</p>
<p>The dwarf leads you to the cabin at the rear of the craft where the crew are excitedly recounting their victory over the Kraan-riders.

<p>As you unsheathe the Sommerswerd, a vivid golden flame shoots along the blade. The Vordak shrieks in terror, its blood-drenched bony fingers clawing at a black iron mace that hangs from its belt. It raises the mace to parry your blow, but the sun-sword shears through the iron, a splash of blue flame erupting in its wake. You strike again, curving the golden blade in a great arc. It bites into the Vordak’s neck, tearing through its unnatural body, and severing it diagonally from collarbone to hip. A sickening acidic smell chokes your throat as a fountain of green slime erupts from beneath the red robe. The Vordak crumples and topples from view, its dissolving corpse hissing as its spirals towards Lake Inrahim.</p>

<p>You stagger to your feet to see the <cite>Skyrider</cite> being engulfed by Drakkarim; they leap from their shrieking Kraan and crash onto the decks and outriggers, their black swords already drawn from their scabbards. The dwarves are caught by surprise; their weapons have been unloaded and stored below deck. Even so, they are quick to rally and fight with skill and fury. Above the din you hear Nolrim’s joyous battle-cry, ‘Blood for blood!’</p>

<p>The blood is pounding in your ears as you bound up the marble steps. Twenty feet ahead of you, there is a landing with a stone door set into the wall. The stairs continue to ascend to a parapeted walkway, at the end of which is another stone door, identical to the first. Suddenly, the door on the first landing swings open and a palace guard wheels round to face you.</p>

This Special Item, torn from the armour of a renegade Vassagonian captain during the battle of Ruanon, enables you to communicate with the Itikar. You reassure it that you mean no harm. Itikar are by nature wild and malicious creatures, but the power of the Onyx Medallion tames this natural instinct, subduing them to the wearer’s command.</p>
<p>As you settle in the wide saddle, you catch sight of the Drakkarim streaming across the gangplank. Quickly, you lean forward, unhook the Itikar’s anchor rope from the saddle ring and grab the thick leather reins.</p>

<p>Dawn is breaking on the horizon of a low hill, blurred and dotted with small tufted trees. Swiftly the <cite>Skyrider</cite> has voyaged through the night to arrive at the foothills of the Koneshi Mountains, in whose folds the skyship is safely tucked away from watchful eyes. Twenty-five miles to the north, across a landscape of barren rock and dry brush, lies the Tomb of the Majhan.</p>
<p>You and Banedon set off before the dawn, anxious not to waste either time or the protective cover of darkness. Now, as the great golden disc of the sun rises in the sky, for the first time you can see your goal. A massive excavation has exposed the heart of this scorched land, delving deep around the tombs of its forgotten ancestors. Thousands of Giaks, spiteful and malicious servants of the Darklords, labour unceasingly to remove rock and sand from this quarry, forced by Drakkarim to drag their backbreaking loads up ramps to the rim of the crater.</p>
<p>Close to the edge of the crater, an encampment of black tents surrounds a large domed canopy. Lying in the shade of this construction is a huge flying creature—an Imperial Zlanbeast. Its presence here can only mean one thing: Darklord Haakon has arrived. The thought chills your blood, but you draw comfort from the labour of his slaves. That they continue to labour is a sign that their mission has yet to be completed: the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> has yet to be found.</p>
<p>It is impossible to approach the crater unseen; you will have to wait for darkness before you attempt to enter the Tomb. During the long wait, it is agreed that Banedon should attempt to find Tipasa. It is likely that he is being held captive inside the encampment—the Darklords would be unlikely to kill him before discovering the treasure they seek.</p>

<p>The stairs are high and steep. You gasp for breath and force your aching legs to climb, for the Drakkarim are less than a dozen steps behind you. At the top of the tower, an open arch leads out onto a platform where a huge kettledrum stands. This is used by the tower guard to send messages to the other palace towers.

<p>The explosion is followed by a huge cloud of smoke, which engulfs a cabin perched on the rear deck. As the noise rumbles across the desolate salt-plain, you hear the agonizing shriek of a wounded Kraan; it spirals past the platform, a ragged hole rent in its broken wing.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XIX]</div>
<p>The smoke clears to reveal the grinning face of a dwarf at the cabin window. A smear of soot blackens his rosy cheeks and exaggerates the whiteness of his crooked teeth. He is holding a tube of smoking steel that you assume to be a magic staff, until you notice that each of the dwarf crew carry identical staves. As they point them at the swooping Kraan, gouts of smoke and flame bellow from their tips. Suddenly you recognize the weapons and their wielders—they are dwarves from the mountain kingdom of Bor, armed with one of the inventions for which these ingenious artisans are justly famous throughout Magnamund.</p>
<p>The Kraan are terrified by the noise; they turn their leathery tails and fly away, their Drakkarim riders powerless to stop them. The primitive guns have claimed only one victim, but nevertheless, they have driven off the enemy and saved the skyship from disaster.</p>

The trek back to the <cite>Skyrider</cite> passes uneventfully, and by noon you have reached the rocky crag where the craft is moored. Nolrim is the first to greet you, but he cannot hide his disappointment that you have returned unaccompanied.</p>
<p>‘Do not worry—the answer lies here,’ says Banedon, holding up Tipasa’s diary. ‘Prepare to set sail.’</p>
<p>As the <cite>Skyrider</cite> rises into the clear blue sky, Banedon hands over the helm to Nolrim and bids you follow him to his quarters at the prow. For three hours he pores over his charts, making calculations, checking instrument readings, and racking his brain for the solution that will pinpoint the Tomb of the Majhan.</p>
<p>‘It’s no use,’ he says, tired and exasperated. ‘I cannot fathom these numbers.’</p>
<p>As you peer at the pages of Tipasa’s diary, suddenly you realize that they are written in code. What Banedon had assumed to be positions of stars is a code to three numbers that give the precise location of the Tomb.</p>

They attend to the wound, and, as his strength returns, Banedon listens intently to your account of the terrifying events that have led up to this meeting. As you conclude your woeful tale, Banedon speaks, his voice full of grim determination.</p>
<p>‘The future of Sommerlund rests in our hands, Lone Wolf. We must stop Darklord Haakon from destroying the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>.

Elated by your escape, you throw back your head and give voice to a triumphant yell that is carried away on the chill evening wind.</p>

Your sudden change of direction increases the distance between you and your pursuers, but your feathered mount is badly wounded and you are close to despair; the Itikar is losing so much blood that it could become unconscious at any moment, and drop you like a stone onto the distant surface of Lake Inrahim below.</p>
<p>Suddenly you spot something in the distance. It is a sight that renews your faith in miracles.</p>

<p>Suddenly, you catch sight of Banedon. His arm is raised above the armoured parapet of the platform, and in his hand he holds a slender blue rod. A torrent of water gushes from the rod, arcing into the sky to meet the deluge of liquid flame. There is a tremendous explosion as the elements collide, and a massive whirlpool of flame and water spirals towards the Vordak.</p>
<p>The Vordak shrieks with terror but it is too late—its fate is sealed. The whirlpool consumes the Zlanbeast and its rider in a massive burst of sun-like brilliance.</p>

<p>The golden blade sings in your hand, a crackle of pure energy spreading along its razor-sharp edge. You strike a tremendous blow, splitting the Vordak’s skull to the teeth. It releases an awful howl of unearthly evil, pain, terror, and death. As it falls, its skeletal body dissolves into a smoking green fluid, shrivelling the plants on the ground beneath.</p>
<p>The Drakkarim hesitate as the golden light of the sun-sword glints on their shiny black death-masks; you see your chance and run straight at them, slashing to left and right. A Drakkar raises his shield, but your blade slices clean through the iron-sheathed wood, severing his arm at the shoulder. Wheeling round, you catch another Drakkar in mid-attack, tearing open his black armour with the sword as if it were merely parchment. He screams in agony, but you disappear into the dense foliage before his body falls lifelessly to the soft earth.</p>

<p>Inside, the mood is one of celebration. Tables have been drawn together to form a large semicircle in front of which stands a small, broad-shouldered man dressed lavishly in an embroidered costume. A gold-mounted sword hangs by his side, its blue velvet scabbard as vivid in colour as the man’s silk pantaloons. Affectionately, the man embraces his companions, kissing the friends and relatives who have travelled so many miles to celebrate his wedding. At his side sits his bride, her face concealed behind a veil of shimmering pearls. Suddenly, the tavern is filled with music as the guests take the floor for the wedding dance.</p>
<p>On the far side of the floor you see the owner of the tavern, a stout old lady dressed in sombre black. She watches the festivities with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>Beyond the portal lies a vaulted corridor leading to a grand stairway. You narrowly avoid confrontation with a dozen Drakkarim, saved by your lightning reactions. As the enemy rush from an archway on the second floor landing, you dive behind a statue of the recently deceased Zakhan Moudalla. They are so intent on their chase that they fail to notice your hiding place and hurry down the stairs, grunting in their heavy armour as they run. Silently, you give thanks that Zakhan Moudalla was a very stout man and that his statue casts a very large shadow in which to hide.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairway you discover a hatch, which gives access to the roof. You climb through it and follow a path of sun-bleached tiles that wind in and out of the domes and turrets, eventually leading to a bell-tower.</p>
<p>You are exhausted and need to rest, your mind still full of the shock of your encounter with Darklord Haakon. The sound of his terrible voice repeating the words ‘<cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>’ echoes again and again in your mind.</p>
<p>With desperation sapping your will, you peer out through a grille in the bell-tower. The sight before you renews your flagging hope, for it inspires a daring escape plan.</p>

<p>As you slay the last of the Crypt Spawn, Haakon reels back as if weakened by the death of his creatures. You raise the Sommerswerd, willing the blade to discharge a bolt of power that will burn the evil Darklord from the face of Magnamund forever. The blade shimmers with golden fire, but no searing blast issues from its tip. Suddenly, you realize what has happened; you are beneath the earth, and there is no sun from which the sword can draw its power.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XXI]</div>
<p>Haakon utters a terrible laugh that shakes the floor. A beam of blue flame is growing from the stone in his hand, forming a fiery blade that crackles and spits as it cuts through the dust-choked air. The stench of death and decay fills your nostrils as the Darklord prepares to attack.</p>

<p>You stare out across an alien landscape, a mountain valley filled with thousands of pillars formed from massive and precariously balanced boulders. The pillars reach so high into the sky that an avalanche looks inevitable. The Vassagonians call this place the Koos—‘the needles’. Perched upon two of these huge rocky columns are Kraan, their Drakkarim riders scouring the valley with telescopes. An hour passes before they take to the sky and disappear.</p>
<p>‘Trim the boom-sails, Bo’sun Nolrim,’ orders Banedon, his voice barely audible above the increasing hum of the <cite>Skyrider</cite>. ‘We’ve a fast run ahead.’</p>

<p>You run through the arch and straight into a black-robed palace guard. You bruise your ribs and the impact throws you off balance, but you manage to grab the wall to stop yourself from falling over. The guard lies sprawled upon the floor, but with incredible swiftness he draws a shining steel axe and lashes out at your legs.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Drakkar screams, his limbs outstretched, his gloved hands clawing the air. He is in the grip of some invisible power which is crushing him to death inside his armour.</p>
<p>You step back as the ghastly sound of cracking bones rises above the screech of the swooping Kraan-riders. The Drakkar crumples to the deck and topples over the edge of the platform.</p>

<p>You trudge through the loose red sand, your faces covered to protect them from the dust and the blazing heat. The landscape is stark and desolate; all that seems to thrive here is the wire-hard grass that scratches your boots and leggings. You soon come across a dried river bed that leads to a cave in the orange sandstone hillside. A wooden plaque is nailed by the mouth of the cave, but you are unable to understand the strange words painted on its sun-blistered surface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you misjudged how hard you need to blow to make the dart reach its intended target. The sleep dart falls short, accidentally hitting a seagull that has alighted on the edge of the landing platform. The unfortunate bird takes a few shaky steps before keeling over onto its back, its splayed legs pointing stiffly at the sky.</p>
<p>The guard walks over to the bird and with the toe of his boot, casually flicks it over the edge of the platform. He watches as it spirals down towards the palace gardens far below, unaware that he has only just escaped a similar fate.</p>

<p>Your heart sinks; there are no other stairs down from the platform—you are trapped. Before you can think of a plan, the Drakkarim burst from the arch and attack.</p>

<p>You follow the avenue as it twists and turns through the Armourers’ Quarter of Ikaresh. A street vendor is selling a selection of swords and daggers that catch your eye; they are beautifully crafted, well-balanced and very sharp. A wooden sign displays his prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swords—5 Gold Crowns each</li>
<li>Daggers—3 Gold Crowns each</li>
<li>Broadswords—9 Gold Crowns each</li>
</ul>
<p>You may purchase any of the above weapons if you wish. Continuing along the avenue, you pass a meat market where carcasses of oxen are hung out in the open. You are not surprised to see the Ikareshi of this quarter walking about the streets with pieces of cotton stuffed into their nostrils (suspended by a thread around their necks), for the smell is dreadful.</p>
<p>Eventually you arrive at a fork, but there are no signs to indicate where the new streets lead.</p>

<p>You leap at the staggering form of Darklord Haakon, your weapon poised to strike a killing blow. However, as your arm sweeps down, a spiked fist lashes out; blood spurts from your wrist, your fingers go numb and your weapon falls from your hand. Haakon strikes again, catching you in the chest with a blow that pitches you backwards across the chamber.</p>
<p>You struggle to stand but the battle is over: Haakon has retrieved the glowing stone. The last thing you see before you are consumed by searing blue flame is the evil and triumphant grimace of the Darklord.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and hopes of Sommerlund end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect391">391</a></h3>

<p>As you follow the track deeper into the arboretum, high-pitch shrieks echo above the ceiling of creepers and low branches. The air is humid as a jungle. You press on but the going is difficult; the soft, sticky, rotting humus clings to your boots like river clay.</p>
<p>A sudden movement on the path ahead makes you dive for cover; a handful of Drakkarim are coming this way, led by a figure dressed in red.</p>

<p>You run headlong through the foliage, the piercing scream of the Vordak tearing at your mind. Unless you possess the Kai Discipline of Mindshield, lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.

<p>The Drakkar shrieks a cry of horror and lets the broadsword slip from his fingers. He claws at his death-mask, fumbling for the latch which opens the black steel visor. As it clicks open, a mass of writhing insects tumbles from the helmet. The Drakkar screams like a madman as the creatures slither and crawl around inside his armour, stinging and biting his skin. In his crazed panic, he topples over the parapet and falls to his doom thousands of feet below.</p>

<h3><a name="sect395">395</a></h3>

<p>As far as the eye can see, a long, straight, sandstone corridor slopes away into the distance. Torches crackle and sputter on the walls, illuminating the pictograms engraved in the yellow stone.</p>
<p>At regular intervals, rough-edged slabs protrude into the main corridor. You stop to take a close look at one of these slabs and the floor beneath it and come to a frightening conclusion. They are obviously traps, no doubt set off by the Giaks when they cleared this corridor of sand. Rather than instructing the Giaks to avoid them, the Darklords must have deliberately used their slaves to set them off. Once the traps had been sprung, the squashed bodies were cleared away and the slabs chiselled through to the next section. Pit traps in the floors seem to have been neutralized in the same way. Set off by luckless Giaks, they would have been filled in with the dead bodies and levelled off with sand. The thought of this heartless barbarity fills you with revulsion.</p>
<p>Just over a mile along the corridor, you eventually arrive at a large stone door. The stone surround bears evidence of chisel-work, but the door itself is rock solid.</p>
<p>You notice a faint beam of light descending from a hole in the ceiling. It creates a small circular pool of light, a little to one side of a similar hole in the floor. In the wall near to the door there is a triangular indentation, no larger than a Gold Crown.</p>

<p>Inside the cool marble tower, two flights of spiral stairs meet at a landing. You detect the sound of distant running feet, gradually growing louder. It is coming from one of the spiral staircases, but which one? Suddenly, a band of Drakkarim warriors appear; they are crossing the bridge that leads to the tower. You must escape.</p>

<p>The guard raises a hand to the back of his neck and removes the tiny dart, but before he realizes what has happened, he keels over unconscious, spread-eagled on the landing platform.</p>
<p>You can hear the clatter of running feet echoing across the palace roof: the Drakkarim have arrived. You must act quickly if you are to avoid them.</p>

<p>Banedon lowers his staff, the trace of a wry smile on his pain-racked face. ‘Alas, I was too slow to protect myself, Lone Wolf,’ he says, glancing at his arm. You kneel at his side and free the spear that pins him to the floor. The wound is serious; hastily you staunch the bleeding with strips of cloth torn from his dark blue robes. You recognize the robes, for they are the attire of a Journeymaster. It seems that young Banedon has achieved distinction among his brother magicians since last you met.</p>
<p>‘It appears that we are fated to meet in their company,’ he says, still watching the Kraan-riders anxiously. ‘Help me to my feet, we must escape before they drag us from the sky.’</p>
<p>You support the magician as he grasps the ship’s helm—a radiant crystal sphere with hundreds of glowing facets set on a slim silver rod. No sooner has his hand closed around the crystal than there is a tremendous explosion.</p>

<p>You examine the floor where Darklord Haakon fell, but there are no signs of his body. The atmosphere is strangely calm and peaceful, as if a great and evil shadow has been lifted. (If you lost the Sommerswerd in the confrontation with the Darklord, you may now retrieve it.)</p>
<p>You turn and walk to the throne where Haakon sat, waiting for you to appear. Beyond it lies a portal, an ancient inscription carved deep into the blood-red stone. Below the carving is set the impression of a human hand. Instinct and intuition guide your hand to the door; the carving fits around it like a glove.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XXIV]</div>
<p>Silently the portal slides back to reveal your destiny—the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>. Set on a pedestal, the book lies open, its secrets revealed to your eyes alone. As you lift the sacred book, the very air throbs with the vibration of the force locked within its sun-gold cover. With a pounding heart you close the book and hurry from the chamber.</p>
<p>By the time you reach the foothills of the Koneshi, Banedon has successfully completed his mission; he and Tipasa are waiting for you. As they see you appear, clutching the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>, they can barely contain their excitement.</p>
<p>‘This night of triumph,’ says Banedon, jubilantly, ‘will herald a new dawn of hope for Sommerlund. The Kai are reborn.’</p>
<p>The quest is now over. You have found the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> and freed Magnamund from the shadow of Darklord Haakon. But for you, Kai Master Lone Wolf, the story has only just begun.</p>
<p>Your destiny lies along the path of the Grand Masters. To learn their secrets and attempt the first exciting quest of the Magnakai, begin your journey with Book 6 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series entitled:</p>

<h2><a name="map">The Empire of Vassagonia</a></h2>


<p>The Empire of Vassagonia is a vast desert realm. The northern coast runs roughly east for several hundred miles before it turns in a lazy, rugged arc to the south. Roughly at the apex of this arc is the city of Barrakeesh, the capital city of Vassagonia. The six other cities of this vast arid country are mainly to be found in the thin coastal strip, such as Ferufezan in the northwest, and Bisutan in the south. Barrakeesh is cut off from most of the rest of Vassagonia by the semicircle of the Kabar Range. These mountains meet the sea on the eastern coast at Cape Kabar, which overlooks a trio of islands. For all its magnificent coastline, Vassagonia lacks fresh water, with only six major oases in the entire realm, half of which line the trail to the south of the Dahir Mountains between Ikaresh and Bir Rabalou.</p>

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
