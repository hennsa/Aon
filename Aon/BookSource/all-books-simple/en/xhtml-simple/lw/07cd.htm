 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>You are Lone Wolf—the last Kai Master of Sommerlund. Your vow to restore the Kai to their former glory takes you to the fabulous land of Dessi, a land of monsters and magicians. The sorcerers of this realm pledge to aid your quest—but they demand a price for their help. Somewhere deep within <strong><cite>Castle Death</cite></strong> lies a key to the wisdom of your ancestors. Will you find this key, or will you, like all who have entered before you, succumb to the terror that stalks the dungeons of this nightmare fortress?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


     <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power known as the Lorestones of Nyxator. With their discovery he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and his experiences in a great tome called <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge, you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over one thousand years ago. By doing so successfully, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai that is held within the Lorestones’ crystal forms.</p>
<p>Much of Sun Eagle’s script had faded with the passing years and little remained to help you find the seven Lorestones of Nyxator. Guided by the few words that could still be deciphered, you set out upon a journey that took you to the war-torn city of Tekaro in the hostile land of Slovia. There, hidden deep in the crypt of the city’s cathedral, you found the first Lorestone of Varetta. As you held the crystal triumphantly in your hand, its power was transfused into your being, and the location of the second stone formed slowly in your mind—Herdos.</p>
<p>The remote township of Herdos stands upon the shore of Lake Khor, high in the Xulun Mountains of Dessi. Here the Elder Magi, the magicians who rule the land, helped Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. Time has turned full circle, and once more their aid is sought by a warrior of the Kai.</p>
<p>‘Fate has brought you to us, Lone Wolf,’ intones Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi, as you stand before them in the Tower of Truth at Elzian. ‘And our fate is bound to your quest.’</p>
<p>His clear voice fills the great cylindrical council chamber and the white-robed elders gathered around you respond with one voice, ‘It is so.’</p>
<p>Rimoah leads you to a circular dais, set like a deep well into the green marble floor. Carefully, he kneels and touches its liquid metal surface with his gloved hand. A current flows through the shimmering metal and, within its mirror-like depths, a strange vision slowly takes shape. You see a black-walled fortress set upon a rocky isle, its deep purple shadows reflecting in the dark waters of a moonlit lake.</p>
<p>‘You see before you Kazan-Oud. The Lorestone of Herdos rests in this castle, deep within its accursed halls. We will take you to this fortress, Lone Wolf, but you must enter alone, for our powers hold no sway over the forces that command this terrible place. In the years that have passed since Sun Eagle first came to this land, a great evil has consumed Kazan-Oud. We lack the means to destroy this evil but we have laboured to contain it, to prevent it from spreading beyond the Isle of Khor. Some of the bravest warriors of Magnamund have tried at our behest to defeat the power of Kazan-Oud, yet all have perished. But fate now brings us a Kai Master and our hearts rejoice, for the success of your quest will defeat the bane of Kazan-Oud and deliver us all from its evil shadow.’</p>
<p>A ripple of hopeful whispers arises from the circle of Elders when they hear you state that you will go to Kazan-Oud. As they accompany you from the council chamber to equip you for the dangerous mission that lies ahead, you ask the meaning of the words <i xml:lang="x-unknown">‘Kazan-Oud’</i>. An uneasy silence descends on the dignified company and all eyes turn to Rimoah.</p>
<p>‘In the language of the Sommlending,’ he says, his voice wavering, ‘Castle Death.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to Book 7. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You many choose one bonus <a href="#discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> adventure you successfully complete (Books 6–12).</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Magnakai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
<p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called ‘Lore-circles’. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. (See the section ‘<a href="#lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a>’ for details of these bonuses.)</p>
<p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wpnmstry">Weaponmastery</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 3 to any number that you choose from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Short Sword</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>Axe</li>
<li>Sword</li>
<li>Quarterstaff</li>
<li>Broadsword</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that you are skilled with three weapons does not mean that you begin the adventure carrying any of them. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons during your adventure. For every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> book that you complete in the Magnakai series, you may add an additional weapon to your <a href="#action">Weaponmastery Checklist</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponmastery: +3 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, and tick your chosen weapons on the <a href="#action">Weapons List</a>. You cannot carry more than two Weapons.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlctrl">Animal Control</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to communicate with most animals and to determine their purpose and intentions. It also enables a Kai Master to fight from the saddle with great advantage.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Control’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="curing">Curing</a></h4>

<p>The possessor of this skill can restore 1 lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to his total for every numbered section of the book through which he passes, provided he is not involved in combat. (This can only be done after his <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) This Magnakai Discipline also enables a Kai Master to cure disease, blindness, and any combat wounds sustained by others, as well as himself. Using the knowledge that mastery of this skill provides will also allow a Kai Master to identify the properties of any herbs, roots, and potions that may be encountered during the adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Curing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="invsblty">Invisibility</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai skill allows a Kai Master to blend in with his surroundings, even in the most exposed terrain. It will enable him to mask his body heat and scent, and to adopt the dialect and mannerisms of any town or city that he visits.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Invisibility’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hntmstry">Huntmastery</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Master will never starve in the wild; he will always be able to hunt for food, even in areas of wasteland and desert. It also enables a Kai Master to move with great speed and dexterity and will allow him to ignore any extra loss of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points due to a surprise attack or ambush.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Huntmastery’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="pthmnshp">Pathsmanship</a></h4>

<p>In addition to the basic skill of being able to recognize the correct path in unknown territory, the Magnakai skill of Pathsmanship will enable a Kai Master to read foreign languages, decipher symbols, read footprints and tracks (even if they have been disturbed), and detect the presence of most traps. It also grants him the gift of always knowing intuitively the position of north.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Pathsmanship’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psisurge">Psi-surge</a></h4>

<p>This psychic skill enables a Kai Master to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used as well as normal combat weapons and adds 4 extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. A weaker form of Psi-surge called <cite>Mindblast</cite> can be used against an enemy without losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, but it will add only 2 extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. (Psi-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.) Psi-surge cannot be used if your <small>ENDURANCE</small> falls to 6 points or below, and not all of the creatures encountered on your adventure will be affected by it; you will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Psi-surge: +4 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points but −2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points per round’ and ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psiscrn">Psi-screen</a></h4>

<p>Many of the hostile creatures that inhabit Magnamund have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack and greatly increases your defence against supernatural illusions and hypnosis.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Psi-screen: no points lost when attacked by Mindforce’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="nexus">Nexus</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Magnakai skill will enable you to withstand extremes of heat and cold without losing <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and to move items by your powers of concentration alone.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Nexus’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="dvnation">Divination</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Master of imminent or unseen danger or enable him to detect an invisible or hidden enemy. It may also reveal the true purpose or intent of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure. Divination may enable you to communicate telepathically with another person and to sense if a creature possesses psychic abilities.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Divination’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 7 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you may add a further Magnakai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="../lw/08tjoh.htm#title">Book 8</a>. This additional skill, together with your other Magnakai skills and any Special Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures may then be used in the next adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> series, which is called <a href="../lw/08tjoh.htm#title"><cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before leaving Elzian on your quest for the Lorestone of Herdos, the Elder Magi give you a <a href="#map">map of their land</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed books 1–6 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. You can carry a maximum of only fifty Crowns, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.</p>
<p>The Elder Magi offer you a choice of equipment to aid you on your perilous mission. You can take five items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess. However, remember that you can carry a maximum of two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bow (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows. Tick them off as they are used.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Rope (Backpack Items)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Items) This potion restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for only one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Lantern (Backpack Items)<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">1</a></sup><br /><br />
</li>
<li>Mace (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>3 Meals (Meals) Each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>3 Fireseeds (Special Items) When thrown against a hard surface, these Fireseeds explode and burn fiercely.<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>List the five items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You do not need to make notes, but you should refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Bow—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Quiver—slung over your shoulder.</li>
<li>Rope—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Lantern—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Mace—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Meals—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>Dagger—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Fireseeds—carried in your pocket.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of only eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given initial capitals (e.g. Gold Dagger, Magic Pendant) in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember that you can only carry two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bow and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is strongly recommended that you also equip yourself with a close combat weapon, like a Sword or Mace.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
If you enter combat armed only with a Bow, you must deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at anytime.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, you may already possess Special Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Dessi is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Whenever you kill an enemy and search the body, you may take any Gold Crowns that you find and put them in your Belt Pouch. (Remember the pouch can carry a maximum of fifty Gold Crowns.)<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 19.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Nightstalker’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (19 − 22 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as −3. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
<li>Nightstalker loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

<h3><a name="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></h3>

<p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called ‘Lore-circles’. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>), and their physical and mental stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
<p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
<dd>Weaponmastery &amp; Huntmastery</dd>
<dt>Circle of Light</dt>
<dd>Animal Control &amp; Curing</dd>
<dt>Circle of Solaris</dt>
<dd>Invisibility, Huntmastery &amp; Pathsmanship</dd>
<dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
<dd>Psi-surge, Psi-screen, Nexus &amp; Divination</dd>
</dl>
<p>By completing a Lore-circle, you may add to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> the extra bonus points that are shown below.</p>
<h4><a name="lcbonus">Lore-circle Bonuses</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Circle of Fire</dt>

<dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
<dd>+3 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>All bonus points that you acquire by completing a Lore-circle are additions to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores.</p>
<h3><a name="imprvdsc">Improved Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will steadily improve. If you are a Kai Master that has reached the rank of Primate, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>
<h4><a name="primate">Primate</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Primates with this Magnakai Discipline are able to repel an animal that is intent on harming them by blocking its sense of taste and smell. The level of success is dependent on the size and ferocity of the animal.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have the ability to delay the effects of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison he is able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and are able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Primates with the skill of Nexus will be able to offer a far greater resistance than before to the effects of noxious gases and fumes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Magnakai Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Magnakai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your quest for the Lorestone of Herdos will be fraught with danger for the fortress of Kazan-Oud has a dark and sinister reputation for being the ruin of many a brave adventurer. Make notes as you progress through the story—they will be of great help in this and future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will help you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>Choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest no matter how weak his initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.</p>
<p>May the spirit of your ancestors guide you on the path of the Magnakai.</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>The hours leading up to your departure from Elzian are spent checking and double-checking your equipment and provisions. But, no matter how hard you try to concentrate on these preparations, your mind is constantly invaded by the shadowy image of Kazan-Oud, an image identical to the vision that appeared the previous evening in the well of the council chamber. You are filled with a deep dread, as you contemplate the probable site of your own grave. However, coupled to this terrible sense of foreboding is a far greater and irresistible desire to discover the Lorestone of Herdos.</p>
<p>Shortly before dawn, your thoughts are disturbed by a knock at the door of your chamber: it is Rimoah. The time has come for your mission to begin. You follow him through halls and galleries to a rooftop platform nestling among the crimson towers of the Temple of Truth. Here you are greeted by a young man. He is tall and dark-skinned, with plaited flaxen hair and sharp, cat-like eyes, and he wears the gold and scarlet tunic of a Vakeros—a warrior-magician of Dessi. ‘Hail, Paido!’ says Rimoah, bowing to this proud young man.</p>
<p>‘Hail, my Lord Rimoah,’ he replies, respectfully. ‘We are ready to sail.’</p>
<p>The first rays of the dawn light shimmer along the golden hull of a magnificent skyship that hovers above the rooftop platform. As the hum of its powerful engine rises, you thank Rimoah and bid him farewell before following Lord Paido to the boarding ladder at the edge of the platform. Once safely on board, the skyship rises into the chill dawn air, and Lord Rimoah and the Tower of Truth shrink swiftly beneath its golden keel. You look down with growing fascination as the sleek, bat-winged craft passes over the circling waters of the Elzian Canal and speeds northwards above the jungle of central Dessi. As the grey Chasm of Gorgoron looms into view, splitting the emerald-green land like a deep and terrible wound, Lord Paido joins you at the rail. Time passes in conversation, and you learn much about the people of this untamed land and their history. You learn that the Elder Magi are all that remain of a race of great magicians who ruled central Magnamund many thousands of years ago. They were wise and powerful, and their leadership was great until their numbers were decimated by a plague that swept across the world. Those who survived sought refuge in Dessi and have lived here, in the mountains and the jungle, ever since. The Vakeros are native soldiers of Dessi who have been taught the art of battle-magic by the Elder Magi to help them defend the northern border against invasion by the war-like Vassagonians.</p>
<p>When you tell Lord Paido of your own past battles with the desert warriors, you sense a sadness within him. ‘How I wish my brother Kasin were here with us now,’ he says, staring thoughtfully towards the distant horizon. ‘He could tell many a brave tale of the great desert wars.’ You ask what has become of his brother. There is a long pause before he replies solemnly: ‘Kazan-Oud.’</p>
<p>The land of Dessi is now spread out beneath you like a gigantic map. To the northwest you can see the foothills of the Carcos Range and a faint ribbon-like glimmer that is the River Doi; to the east, a bank of grey storm clouds advances unchecked across a sea of jungle vegetation. Shortly before noon you sight your destination. The low-domed buildings of Herdos appear on the horizon, followed by the waters of Lake Khor and a blackened finger of rock upon which sits Kazan-Oud. Even at this great distance, the awesome sight of the terrible fortress sends a chill along your spine.</p>
<p>Lord Paido orders his crew to prepare for landing, and within the hour, the great skyship is casting its shadow upon the flagstones of the Plaza of Herdos. You are welcomed by Lord Ardan, Elder of Herdos, and a detachment of his Vakeros guards. They escort you through the streets of the ancient town, past the tiny stone-walled dwellings of fishermen and miners, to a quay where a glass-domed tower several storeys high commands access to the busy harbour. As you enter the tower, you notice that the glass dome radiates a greenish light that, in spite of the blinding glare of the midday sun, can be seen quite clearly.</p>
<p>Later, as the sun sinks slowly behind the peaks of the mountains, the light emanating from the tower becomes more visible, covering Lake Khor with an umbrella of ghostly luminescence. Lord Ardan explains: ‘This tower, together with five others that encircle the lake, generates a shield of magical energy that imprisons the evil of Kazan-Oud. No creature, living or dead, can enter or leave the Isle of Khor so long as our shield remains intact. We dare not lower our guard, and, to allow you to land on the island, we have devised a means by which you may pass through the shield unharmed.’ He takes a gem the size of a small apple from the pocket of his silken robe and places it in your hand. It is a dull translucent red, but within its core a swirling mist of glittering sparks flickers with gold and silver fire.</p>
<p>‘It is a Power-key. Guard it well, for so long as you possess it you may fulfil your quest; lose it and you will never escape from the Isle of Khor.’ (Mark the Power-key on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item, which you carry in the pocket of your tunic.) ‘At midnight, my Vakeros will take you by boat to the edge of the shield. On board is a small coracle in which you can pass through the shield and make your way to the Isle of Khor. We shall pray for you, Lone Wolf.’</p>
<p>Midnight finds you standing on the deck of a square-rigged fishing boat. The sighing night wind and the creak of rope and timber are the only sounds that accompany you across the black waters of Lake Khor. You arrive at a wall of shimmering, green light: the power-shield. The Vakeros whisper their goodbyes, and you paddle through the wall, drawing closer with every stroke to the sinister island fortress.</p>
<p>Two hundred yards from the glistening black shoreline, you note two places where you can make a landing.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to land at a stone jetty to the west of Kazan-Oud, <a href="#sect135">turn to 135</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>Your eye is drawn to a panel on the hexagonal wall. The central part of the stonework is much newer than the surrounding edges, a detail which your Magnakai Discipline enabled you to recognize at a glance. After closer examination, you are sure that there was once a door in this wall. The stone does not sound as if it is solid when you tap it, and you suspect it would not withstand several well-placed blows.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to break through the wall, <a href="#sect228">turn to 228</a>.</p>

<p>The rumble of a massive counterweight descending behind the wall sends a shudder through the flagstones. The portcullis rises and you hear the lever click back to its original position as you duck under the pointed bars.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect277">Turn to 277</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>The shadow flares red before dissolving into a dense grey mist that is carried away swiftly on the stormy air. A sudden chill makes you shiver. You pull your cloak around you, taking comfort from its warmth, but it is as if the cold comes not from the damp wind but from somewhere deep inside you.</p>
<p>You feel hungry and you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. When you have finished, you make a quick check of your equipment before taking your first cautious steps inside the Great Hall.</p>

<h3><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>‘Good!’ booms the voice of Zahda, as you land on the opposite side of the pit. ‘You are brave! But have you brains as well as battle-brawn, I wonder? Ha! Soon we shall see.’</p>
<p>The voice conjures an image of Lord Zahda in your mind. He is seated on a golden throne with the object of your quest, the Lorestone of Herdos, suspended in the air above him. You resolve to survive this accursed maze and escape. If you can then only find your way back to Zahda’s throne hall, the success of your quest will be within your grasp.</p>
<p>You walk along the passage that leads away from the pit, your mind filled with dismay as you contemplate the problems and perils that lie before you. One such problem looms into view as the passage takes a sharp turn.</p>

<p>As it springs out of the gloom, you hack at the beast, carving a slice from its great hairy shoulder. But the shock of its attack sends you reeling to the floor, and you scream out in pained surprise. Claws rake your arm; burning saliva stings your face. Desperately, you stab at the snarling beast as it dips its head and closes its massive jaws around your legs. The creature is immune to Mindblast but <em>not</em> Psi-surge.</p>

<p>Descending the narrow staircase, you arrive at a tunnel-like corridor, sandwiched between two walls of mouldering masonry. Foul, oily water gurgles along a channel in the slippery floor towards a distant archway, which is blocked by a black iron portcullis. Bolted to the criss-crossed bars is a plaque which bears a curious design:<sup><a href="#sect11-1-foot" name="sect11-1">2</a></sup></p>
<p>On the wall to your left is a large, rusty dial with a brass pointer. Set around it, like the numerals of a clock, are the numbers 1 to 40, and below the dial is a lever. Your basic Kai instincts tell you that by selecting the correct number, or numbers, and pulling the lever, you will open the portcullis.</p>

<h3><a name="sect12">12</a></h3>

<p>‘We’re as good as dead if we stay here,’ says the warrior in a broad Stornlands accent. ‘Come, we best find ourselves a safe tunnel before they release a Trakka. We’ll have a horde of Zahda’s pets snappin’ at our heels if it picks up our scent.’</p>
<p>You follow the man through a labyrinth of tunnels and chambers; descending by slope and staircase to deeper levels of this subterranean world. Not a word is spoken until, finally, you stop to rest in a small, musty chamber, its entrance partially hidden behind a rockfall of scarlet stone. ‘How long have you been tunnel-running?’ your companion asks. When you reply that you’ve been in Kazan-Oud no more than a few hours, his face registers a look of surprise followed by disappointment. ‘I’d have stood and fought the Dhax had I known I was so near to the surface,’ he says, shaking his head and staring dejectedly at the floor.</p>
<p>He tells you that his name is Tavig and that he comes from Suentina, a city in the western land of Slovia. Over a year ago his sister was captured by Sadzar, the slaver of Gzor, when a ship on which she was a passenger was attacked by his pirate fleet off the island of Lio. One thousand Crowns was the ransom Sadzar placed on her head, and Tavig vowed he would raise the gold and save his sister or die in the attempt. Undaunted by the rumours he had heard, he travelled to Herdos to offer his services to the Elder Magi, to attempt the destruction of the evil that haunts Kazan-Oud, in return for his sister’s ransom. They agreed to his price, as they had agreed to scores of others’ before him, and sent him through the power-shield with their hopes and prayers for success. That was one year ago.</p>
<p>‘One man alone could never hope to destroy Zahda, he who commands this fortress, for his power has grown greater than the Elders imagine. I tried and I failed. Twice I’ve been captured and twice I’ve escaped from his maze, and now my only wish is to escape from this fortress of nightmares. I’m a tunnel-runner, a survivor, a fugitive from Zahda’s law, but I fear my time has nearly run out.’</p>
<p>Drawing his sword, Tavig walks to the entrance and peers into the corridor outside. ‘Luck be on your side, stranger,’ he says, and hurries away. You call out for him to wait, to tell you more of what he has learnt of Kazan-Oud, but your pleas go unanswered as he disappears into the tunnel.</p>

<p>The shriek of metal on metal reverberates along the tunnel as great iron cogs grind into action.<sup><a href="#sect13-1-foot" name="sect13-1">3</a></sup> Slowly, the portcullis rises into the roof. Wasting no time, you duck beneath the pointed bars and hurry into the passage beyond.</p>
<p>Rats flee, squeaking, as you stalk along the slippery flagstones. You wince as their claws rasp on the wet rock and their hairless tails furrow the stinking green slime that covers the surface of the tunnel floor. The passage widens as it approaches a staircase that leads down. Halfway down the stairs you disturb a colony of bats nesting in the ceiling. They squeal angrily and whirl around your head, battering you with their wings and nipping at your face with their sharp, needle-like teeth.</p>

<p>The brick slides in and the secret door slides open. Before you stands an ugly, bearded dwarf, wearing a grimy black velvet jerkin. His pig-eyes twinkle malevolently as he raises a hollow brass tube and points it at your face.</p>
<p>‘Sweet dreams,’ he cackles, and a blast of icy cold vapour shoots from the tip, catching you squarely in the face. You reel back, coughing and choking as the bitter vapour fills your lungs.

<h3><a name="sect15">15</a></h3>

<p>You spin a screw-like handle set in the centre of the door, releasing the lock. You open the door and enter: inside, you discover a room of steel. The walls, ceiling, and floor are all constructed of metal plate, which is polished to give a mirror-like shine. Low, iron tables are set out with the implements and accessories of magic: crucibles, retorts, aludels, flasks, and all manner of twisting glass tubes, which bubble and seethe with multi-coloured liquids. Vellum-bound tomes and crumbling parchments litter the shelves, competing for space with repulsive-looking pink organs floating in glass jars of vile-smelling preservative. Quickly you scan the shelves in search of useful items and, to your delight, rediscover all your confiscated Weapons. (Re-enter on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> everything that was taken from you before you were sent to the maze.)</p>
<p>In addition to your Weapons, you discover a large jar of concentrated Laumspur (restores 8 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points) and a Kazan-Oud Platinum Amulet. If you wish to take the Amulet, mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item, which you wear on your wrist. It will protect you from injury due to exposure to high temperatures.</p>

<p>It takes a few minutes for you to get your bearings in the gloom of the narrow corridor. Outside, strange sounds echo across the beach, making you forget your natural caution and move deeper into the darkness. The uneven floor is coated with mud, and the warm, moist air reeks with a repugnant odour that reminds you of gutted fish. You press on, taking great pains not to slip and fall, but the light soon fades completely and you slow to a halt.</p>

<p>The passage leads to an enormous compound of cells that holds the slaves of Kazan-Oud. They are, in the main, a pitiful herd of gangling, black-skinned creatures, with sorrowful eyes and backs bent crooked by years of hard labour. These prisoners press their sad faces against the tiny grates of their cells, curious to see the fair-skinned warrior who walks upright among them.</p>
<p>They hiss as you pass until the entire complex echoes to the sound of their sibilant scorn. At the end of the block, there is a cell that resembles a cage, denying its prisoner even the small degree of privacy provided by the others. You stare through the bars at a dark-skinned man sleeping on the straw-covered floor. His blond hair and red and gold tunic are stained with blood and grime. A key to his cell hangs by a cord on a peg driven into the nearby wall.</p>

<p>A maniacal scream of anger echoes from behind the grating as the giant snake crashes lifelessly to the ground. Suddenly bolts of red fire are raining down all around you, splintering the stone floor and leaving nothing but molten cinders wherever they strike. You clamber across the snake and dive into the tunnel to avoid this rain of crimson death.</p>
<p>To your dismay, you discover the tunnel is no more than a shallow cave, a shelter for a clutch of eggs, each one no smaller than a barrel of ale. They rest upon a bed of packs and torn clothing, the last remains of adventurers who fell foul of the traps of Kazan-Oud.</p>

<p>The stone blocks of a fallen tower lie scattered in an uneven line across the beach, like the vertebrae of a long-dead giant.

<p>After what seems like an hour, but in reality is only a few minutes at the most, the scorching heat subsides and the tunnel air becomes painless to breathe. You press on and soon arrive at an archway, where the shiny steel tube enters a chamber gouged out of solid black iron. There a spiral staircase ascends to a portal. You climb the stairs and peer out through the portal. A sight greets you that sets your pulse racing. Before you stands a gleaming block of solid gold—the back of Lord Zahda’s throne. Above it, hovering motionless in the air, are two perfect crystals: one glows darkly with black fire; the other radiates a pure golden light that sends a shiver down your spine. It is the object of your quest—the Lorestone of Herdos.</p>

<p>A coldness probes your mind, like fingers of ice seeking to crush your will, but your Psi-screen melts the numbing grip of this psychic attack. You lash out with your foot and send the Sceptre spinning into the chasm. There is a silence, and then a dull boom, like distant thunder, reverberates in the abyss far below.</p>

<p>Stepping carefully through the slime-smeared rubble, you stop for a moment to catch your breath and survey the shattered keep of Kazan-Oud. It is a desolate sight. Only stone buildings remain intact, and everything is covered with creepers and mildew. A great fire must have ravaged the inner fortress to have resulted in such total devastation.</p>
<p>In the centre of the keep stands the Great Hall, still an imposing stronghold and made all the more frightening by the constant flash of green lightning. Beyond its burnt and fungus-covered wooden door, twisted tree forms, with sharp, barbed thorns, sprawl across the cracked flagstones like coils of steel wire. You are about to enter when a movement in the air around your head arrests you. A shape is taking form in the doorway, a shadowy figure with flaming red eyes. An icy chill grips your heart as it sweeps past you with a swirling rush of wind. You spin round to see it hovering in the sky, its shadowy hand now gripping a great spiked ball and chain. It shrieks an unearthly cry, and the ball whistles down towards your unprotected face.</p>

<p>The passage becomes hotter and noisier the deeper you explore it. Unless you have the Magnakai Discipline of Nexus and have reached the rank of Primate, you must now deduct 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points from your total due to the suffocating heat and choking, sulphurous fumes. Another tunnel looms out of the yellowish mist to your right. With watery eyes, you peer down it; a red glow fills a crack in the distance. The ground vibrates to an incessant screeching of metallic objects scraping against stone and steel, and this noise, together with the stinking atmosphere, conspires to numb your senses.</p>

<p>Your light flares brightly in the moist gloom of the passage. A cavern lies immediately ahead, its high-arched roof a mass of dripping stalactites, hanging like thick spears of pearly white stone. Cautiously, you step across the cavern floor, your skin prickling, as peculiar sounds emanate from the shadows.</p>
<p>You wind your way through the labyrinth of tunnels, slipping on moss-covered rocks, grazing your head on low ceilings, and scrambling up and down steep ridges and rockfalls until you arrive at a smooth-walled chamber carved with precision from the hard black rock. A staircase ascends through an archway to your left, and directly ahead stands a massive stone door.</p>

<p>The guard fires as you run at him, the sneer on his face boasting his confidence that you will soon be a dead man.

You attack and he attempts to parry your first blow with his empty crossbow; you knock it from his trembling fingers, leaving him without a weapon to hand.</p>

<div class="illustration">[Illustration IV]</div>
<p>You turn to see a mass of slimy, twisting serpents, each as long and as thick as your arm, hatching from one of the eggs. Instinctively, they slither towards you, attracted by your body heat and driven on by an insatiable desire for food.</p>

<p>You have walked less than ten feet along the corridor when you are knocked off your feet by a terrible numbing blow to your chest. The ghostly outline of a skeletal warrior shimmers in the air above you, a bloodied spear gripped in its fleshless hands. The wound is fatally deep, and the image soon fades into darkness as your life’s blood ebbs away.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>

<p>You have a strong feeling that the entrance is guarded by a trap. The sickening odour reminds you of your first hunting trip as a Kai Initiate to the foothills of the Durncrag Mountains of Sommerlund.

<p>Your Arrow sings through the smoky air and pierces the dog-like skull of the leading creature. It halts, as if frozen to the spot, and a sizzling sound emanates from its open jaws. Then, with a flash, it bursts into flames. The fire consumes the creature completely in a matter of seconds and its body disintegrates, dropping to the floor in glowing, sticky lumps like molten lava. The other creatures appear undaunted by this and quicken their unnatural gait. With a rasping <i>click</i>, curved talons shoot from their webbed fingers in preparation for attack.</p>

<p>The Zagothal is totally blind and completely deaf. By using your Kai Mastery to mask the scent and heat of your body, you manage to avoid the creature’s attack and make your escape towards the distant rock wall.

<p>The creature’s flaming fists scorch your tunic, but your Kai Mastery enables you to survive the worst of the searing heat.

<p>Taking hold of a crate, you pull open the lid as easily as if you were tearing the peel from an overripe orange. The damp timber crumbles in your hands, falling on the tarnished pewter plates lying within. Your boot staves in the side of another crate, and you hear the dull crunch of shattered porcelain. This one is full of old Kakushi vases, part of a cargo from a trading barge that sank on the reef over a decade ago.</p>
<p>You are about to leave when something unusual catches your eye: the tip of a cylindrical map case is jutting out from behind an empty cask. Unlike everything else in this foul room, it is both dry and quite new. Flipping the brass catch, you tip the contents into your palm: a small piece of parchment and a Diamond (you may keep this Special Item in your pocket). A snake with one large eye is drawn in red ink on the parchment. It is coiled around the number <strong>123</strong>. Make a note of this number in the margin of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>—it may be of use to you later in your adventure.</p>

<p>The tapestries are similar to others you have seen in the lower levels of Kazan-Oud; they are extremely beautiful and exceedingly valuable. However, it is what you discover behind them that is of greater interest, for they conceal a secret door. Your basic Kai senses alert you to a tiny button set into the wall. You press it and the door slides open to reveal a circular tunnel of gleaming steel. Quickly you enter and the door slides shut, moments before the hall is filled with Zahda’s guards.</p>

<p>The Lekhor twists and writhes in frustrated fury, for it cannot shake you free from its trunk. The head rears up and a droplet of venom splashes the back of your hand.

<p>Horror twists the warrior’s face as your Arrow whistles through the air. He opens his mouth to scream, but the cry dies in his throat as your shaft buries itself deep in his chest. He staggers, his arms outstretched as if to grab at a rail, and tumbles from the walkway into the smoky chasm.</p>
<p>A hungry shriek resounds from the arch. You draw another Arrow and take aim at the darkness as a murmur of low mutterings becomes audible. The sounds chill you. Gurgling and hissing through clenched teeth, three creatures, their skins as black as night, creep from the shadows and fix you with terrible fiery eyes.

<p>The warrior is halfway across the walkway when a hungry shriek resounds from the arch. He spins on his heel and crouches in readiness for combat. A murmur of low mutterings follows; the sound chills you. Then, gurgling and hissing through clenched teeth, three creatures, their shiny skins as black as night, creep from the shadows and fix you both with fiery stares. The warrior begins to shake, his sword wavering in his gloved hand. As the creatures stalk forward, his nerve breaks and he turns and flees towards you.</p>

<p>You enter a chamber where a tall bronze statue stands. You recognize its distinctive head-dress and robes immediately: it is a Zakhan, a ruler of the desert empire of Vassagonia. The statue looks most distressed: its arms are outstretched in a gesture of hopelessness, and the expression on its face is one of sorrow and despair. Beyond the statue, an oval-shaped door is set flush in the wall, but you discover that it is locked.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VI]</div>
<p>The mist grows brighter. Once more the skull appears and speaks, its voice as comforting as a raven’s croak:</p>
<blockquote>

        ‘Listen to the Zakhan,<br />
        Ponder what you hear;<br />
        Give the correct answer,<br />
        For fear he sheds a tear.’<br />
       </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The skull disappears into the misty ceiling, and you watch amazed as the dull bronze lips of the statue begin to move. A harsh voice echoes from deep within its hollow metal body:</p>
<p>‘My daughter has many sisters, as many sisters as she has brothers, but each of her brothers has twice as many sisters as brothers. So answer me this, wise warrior, how many sons and daughters do I have?’</p>
<p class="puzzle">Consider your answer carefully and, when you have decided, write down first the number of sons the Zakhan has and then, immediately next to it, the number of daughters.

<p>You race over to your companion’s side and discover that he is still conscious, although he has lost a lot of blood. Using your healing skill, you repair the wound as best you can, but it is deep and severe and you can only prolong his life for a few minutes at most. You tell him of your quest and the help the Elder Magi have given to enable you to enter Kazan-Oud. As you recount your air voyage to Herdos aboard Lord Paido’s skyship, you notice his eyes flicker in recognition of the name.</p>
<p>‘My name is Kasin,’ he says, painfully. ‘Lord Paido is my brother.’ You notice the resemblance in his cat-like eyes and square jaw. ‘I’m finished, Kai Lord,’ he says, his face bathed in sweat, ‘but I can and will help you in your quest. Listen carefully. Over there, behind the tapestry, is a secret passage. It leads to Zahda’s throne. Above the throne is the Lorestone of Herdos, but beware, Zahda has coupled its power to a Doomstone from the realm of Naaros. He draws his power from that accursed gem. If you are to succeed, you must first destroy the Doomstone or you will surely perish. Sadly, I cannot help you escape from Kazan-Oud, for I myself was captured long before I reached the surface, but if you can get to the beach, make your way to the old stone jetty. I hid my boat beneath the steps there.’ His grip tightens around your hand as a wave of pain washes over his body. ‘When you return to Elzian,’ he gasps, ‘tell my brother that my death was not in vain…May the gods protect you…Lone Wolf.’</p>
<p>As his eyes close for the last time, you promise that his bravery will live forever in the hearts of the Vakeros—his brave warrior kin.</p>

<p>Four warriors, dark and grim, march into the hall in single file. At once their black armour and skull-like helmets make you think they are Drakkarim—evil human warriors who serve the Darklords of Helgedad. But when they draw to a halt before the sarcophagus, you see that they cannot possibly be human. Their great sloping shoulders support unnaturally long arms, and the hands that grip their weapons are covered with bristling ginger hair. Yellowed talons curve from their fingers, and behind them hang long black tails, tufted at the end like the tails of lions.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VII]</div>

<p>Cautiously you walk along the passage, expecting the unexpected, until you arrive at a circular vault. There, upon a block of marble in the centre of the floor, lies a steel sword.

<p>You stare into the inky black eyes and command the creature to cease its attack. Instantly the slimy, worm-like thing rears up, its short, rubbery legs scrabbling the air in agony, as your command burns into its sensitive and vulnerable brain. As it twists back on itself, its head disappears into the mist. There is an ear-splitting crack as blue lightning engulfs the creature, crackling snake-like around its neck, and filling your nostrils with the stench of burning meat. The creature thrashes wildly for several minutes, and when its gruesome dance is finally done, the canopy of mist is no longer there. In the darkness above, you see a walkway with an observation platform.</p>

The bleeding stops and his heartbeat grows stronger, but you sense that it is only a temporary reprieve. His back is broken and, here, in this hostile fortress, there is no hope for his survival and recovery with so serious an injury. Briefly he regains consciousness and forces himself to speak. ‘Beware the maze, Northlander…green…is death.’</p>

The vibrations gather power from the hand itself, setting up an explosive reaction that cannot be reversed.

There is another flash of lightning, and a hundred tower windows glare at you like empty eyes edged with slivers of broken glass. A line of carved stone gargoyles adorns the black stone walls, overhanging the jetty. Rings of rusted iron are clamped in their snarling jaws, each wound round with slime-encrusted ropes that dangle in the water. At the jetty, it is deep enough to allow a large vessel to dock, but the current and the swell of the tide make it increasingly difficult for you to control your tiny boat.</p>

<p>With all your will, you command the snake to come no closer. Its great eye burns you with an icy stare, the black slit pupil shrinking and dilating with every beat of its evil heart. It sways above you, hesitating to attack, as your Kai Mastery plants seeds of doubt in its mind, blocking its primeval desire to savage and consume your warm-blooded being. As the monstrous head sways from side to side, you catch a glimpse of a small tunnel in the opposite wall, previously hidden by the snake and its nest. The sight of this possible means of escape momentarily breaks your concentration: the snake lunges forward to attack. Only the speed of your reactions saves you from its venomous fangs. Reluctantly, it retreats at your command and settles in the centre of the chamber, its head resting on its coils as it settles down to sleep.<sup><a href="#sect137-1-foot" name="sect137-1">7</a></sup></p>

<p>You unsheathe your weapon and strike a mighty blow at the black crystal. It splits clean in two, releasing its dark power and showering you with hot sparks in the wake of its destruction. The riven fragments hurtle into the fiery abyss that surrounds Zahda’s throne, quashing the roaring flames.</p>
<p>‘Curse you, Kai Lord!’ screams Lord Zahda, leaping out from behind the golden throne, brandishing a platinum rod. Defiantly, he points the rod at your head and spits an evocation, but the power he calls upon no longer heeds his cry. From the depths of the pit, a terrible roar begins to grow. The floor shakes and a column of flame lights the entire throne-hall as molten lava spews high into the air. Zahda staggers back, his face aghast with terror. Hurriedly he kneels before his throne, his crooked fingers stroking at a pentagram engraved in the gold. Above the din of destruction, another sound, like the ringing of a thousand tiny bells, can be heard, and in the blackness above the throne a speckled glow appears. It descends towards Lord Zahda until he is totally engulfed by a column of shimmering blue light. His body rises, lifted by unseen hands.</p>

<p>You inch your way along the tunnel until you reach a dead end. The red glow you saw earlier is pouring through a narrow portal, shaped like a large arrow slit. You look through it at an awesome sight. A cavernous crater, formed of black iron, drops in tiers to a blood-red floor far below. Hundreds of moving forms crowd every level, dragging wagons and pulling monstrous machines up long ramps and across connecting causeways. Other forms, dressed in black, beat and curse them; the heat and fumes that are wafting through the portal prevent you from seeing them more clearly.</p>
<p>Suddenly a solid sheet of iron descends from the ceiling and seals off the portal. You step back and turn to leave, but in the smoky distance you see another wall of iron closing off the exit.</p>

If it were not for the unmistakable smell of death, you could be forgiven for thinking that he was asleep. You turn the body over to take a look at his face and recoil in shock at the sight before you.

It flickers and, for a second, you catch a glimpse of a skull-like face through the iron bars. Fear wells up inside you as a chilling laugh pierces the silence. But it is not the sound of the cruel, inhuman laughter that freezes your blood, it is the sight of the colossal, wedge-shaped head that is rearing up through the mound on which you sit; it is the head of a gigantic snake.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration IX]</div>
<p>You leap to your feet and run to the far corner of the chamber, your heart pounding loudly in your ears. The snake rises up almost to the ceiling, its forked tongue flickering angrily below a single yellow eye which is set deep in the centre of its green scaly head. Once more the chamber echoes to cruel laughter as the monster shakes off its rotting nest and slithers forward.</p>

<p>You awake to such an astounding sight that you feel sure you must be dreaming. Before you lies a titanic, circular hall of glittering marble, rising tier on tier like a gigantic amphitheatre. A vast pit fills the centre, from which arises a pinnacle of black iron, which is licked by sheets of flame that roar up from the depths below. Scores of seated creatures crowd the tiers, every one of them staring at you, their eyes like pinpoints of fire gleaming coldly from the shadows of their hooded robes. You hear the rustle of their mocking laughter, and your skin prickles with eerie premonition. A great gong booms in the distance, and a doleful chant arises from the crowded tiers. An urge to run from this evil place grips you like a fever, but your wrists are manacled securely to a bronze ring fixed to the wall above your head.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration X]</div>
<p>‘Let the trial commence!’ commands a mighty voice, filling the hall with clamouring echoes. As one, the robed spectators rise from their seats as a shaft of light pours down upon the pinnacle, illuminating the outline of a man, white-haired and gaunt, seated on a massive throne of solid, gleaming gold. Suspended in the air above his head are two crystals: one as clear as a polished diamond; the other as black as the grave. A crackling arc of energy travels between the two, and its flickering blue light sheds a ghostly shadow on the face of the seated lord.</p>
<p>‘Intruder,’ he says, his voice soft yet chilling, ‘you have come to Kazan-Oud with murder in your heart. Have not the cowards of Elzian promised to reward you for my destruction?’</p>
<p>A drone of dissent surges from the crowded tiers, drowning any answer that you offer in your defence. The lord rises slowly from the throne and turns to his baying minions, his hands outstretched as if to receive the adulation. As their ghastly drone grows louder, your eye is drawn to the clear crystal that hovers above the throne. A golden light now glows at its core. In a flash of understanding you recognize the object of your quest: here is the Lorestone of Herdos.</p>
<p>‘Your verdict, my children?’ cries the wild-eyed man, his voice now harsh and angry.</p>
<p>‘Guilty, Lord Zahda,’ the crowd howls in reply.</p>
<p>‘The sentence?’ retorts their master.</p>
<p>‘The maze!’ they scream. ‘The maze!’</p>

The walls of the corridor, festooned with what appear to be gigantic cocoons, stretch into the distance as far as you can see. The oval door clicks shut and the <i>click</i> reverberates down the corridor, growing louder and louder. In the gloomy corridor ahead you see that something is moving.</p>

Beyond an outcrop of pitted stone, a stream cascades down the sheer rock wall, cutting a deep gully across the beach as it flows into the lake. Spanning this gully is a natural bridge of stone.

His eyes, now glazed and lifeless, are cat-like in structure; his fingers are short and tipped with claws; and his lower jaw protrudes several inches below his upper jaw. The skin is badly scarred but not by battle-wounds; they are the scars of crude surgery.</p>
<p>There is no sign of the whip with which he attacked you, but you find a Spear slung by a cord over his shoulder, and a Silver Whistle (mark this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item) on a chain around his blood-spattered neck.

There it meets another path running from east to west. Cautiously you advance along the walkway, your stomach unsettled by the stench of the sulphurous smoke and the sight of the dark, yawning void on either side.</p>
<p>At the junction, you hear the sound of running feet echoing from an archway to your right. The footfalls grow louder and, suddenly, a man in leather armour bursts out of the darkness, his studded boots striking sparks on the stone pathway as he skids to a halt. Sweat pours down his lean and leathery face, and his eyes flash with fear. He casts an anxious glance over his shoulder before unsheathing his sword and advancing towards you.</p>

Wearily, you get to your feet and press on along the tunnel, which is now noticeably cooler and clearer than before. You soon emerge into a hall that is filled with a strong, earthy smell. Two rows of great stone pillars support the roof, and a huge granite sarcophagus stands in the centre of the floor.

<p>Chunks of stone and iron are blasted into the upper reaches of the throne-hall by the increasing power of the eruptions. Boulders, some the size of horses, seem to tumble in slow motion all around the beam as you are drawn irresistibly nearer to the roof. Suddenly the beam fades and you find yourself standing on a circular plinth in the centre of a ruined temple near to the gatehouse of the castle keep. The glare of daylight blinds you, but as you gradually become accustomed to it you cast your eyes over the shimmering waters of Lake Khor to the town of Herdos, perched on the horizon.

<p>A howling blue fire leaps from Zahda’s staff and instinctively you hurl yourself to the floor to evade its searing heat. The bolt screams past into the darkness of the hall, where it explodes in a splash of vivid sparks.</p>
<p>Zahda screams with anger and frustration and attempts to crush your head with one vicious blow, but you save yourself by rolling aside, and the staff cleaves open the black iron floor. A gout of flame rises from the split and blisters the mad lord’s hand; he shrieks like a wounded crow, and the staff drops from his fire-blackened fingers.</p>
<p>You see your chance to attack and lash out, but Zahda is quick to react. He leaps backwards, unsheathing a glowing dagger as he steadies himself on the brink of the abyss. Lord Zahda is immune to Mindblast but not Psi-surge.</p>

It dips and swerves upwards, opening its jaws, set with fangs like long yellow knives, and fixing you with its blind white eyes. You are clinging to the body of a deadly Lekhor that is poised to strike.</p>

<p>As you reach the centre of the bridge, the leading rats are flowing up the slope of the arch. You turn and confront them, drawing a weapon in preparation for a fight to the death, if necessary. As they swarm nearer, you lash out, cleaving them from the narrow apex to fall, splashing, into the torrent of water below.</p>
<p>With your third blow, a shudder runs through the stone, causing you to stagger and fall. You land on the opposite bank, winded but otherwise unharmed. A loud crack fills the night and the whole centre section of the bridge collapses into the gully with a tremendous splash. Safe now from the ravenous rats, you can afford to continue along the beach at a less punishing pace.</p>

<p>An escort of armoured guards forces you along a steel passageway lined by a crowd of jeering minions. They punch and spit as you pass between them, and their foul curses ring in your ears. The guards halt before a huge door of iron and unlock the manacles that encase your bruised and bloodied wrists. The points of their spears never wander far from your throat, discouraging any attempt at escape. The door rumbles open, and a cheer goes up as you are pushed head-first into a foul-smelling pit.</p>
<p>‘Welcome to the maze,’ sneers the chilling voice of Lord Zahda from somewhere high above your head. You struggle to your feet and peer up at a ceiling of swirling mist. A faint glow is gradually taking shape, condensing and forming into the likeness of a human skull. Baleful green eyes stare down at you from bony sockets, and a powdered wig, like that of a high court judge, sits squarely upon its fleshless head.</p>
<p>‘You came here to kill but your plans have been foiled and now you must face the consequence,’ echoes a voice in the skull. ‘You have been sentenced to enter the Maze of Zahda. If you escape, your life may be spared; if you fail then you will surely die—a fitting end for one who came here in search of death.’</p>
<p>The skull retreats into the mist, and a deathly silence fills the pit. A semicircular shadow forms on the wall ahead; it grows larger and darker until it resembles the mouth of a cave or tunnel. Suddenly a gust of chill air whistles from out of this darkness, and you realize that you are staring at the entrance to the maze.</p>
<p>‘Enter!’ orders the voice. ‘Enter or die where you stand!’ It is no idle threat. A crossbow bolt slams into the sand barely inches from your feet, and the <i>click</i> of a steel drawstring warns that another could follow if you disobey the command. Reluctantly, you step forward and enter the Maze of Zahda.</p>

<p>Mustering all your reserves of strength, you spring along the passage, spurred on by the sound of gnashing fangs. There is a dead end ahead, but a passage leads off to the right. You turn the corner as fast as you can, scraping the wall painfully with your shoulder as you fight to keep on your feet, but you are soon forced to a halt—the passage is blocked. Glinting in the dim light is a cluster of huge bubbles, floating languidly up and down between the misty ceiling and the polished floor. A slight breeze lifts them and they bounce towards you.</p>

<p>As you approach the tiny bay, which is tucked inside the shelter of a horseshoe reef of jagged black rocks, your eye is caught by the glow of tiny red lights, moving in the shadows at the base of the fortress wall. You notice a dry hollow among a group of rocks close to the shore that offers an ideal hiding place for your little boat. Silently, you disembark and drag the coracle up the beach towards the rocks. Seconds later you are halted dead in your tracks by the sound of muffled squealing. Sweat breaks out on your brow when a flash of lightning reveals scores of small red eyes close to the sand. A seething flood of rats, each as large as a puppy but gaunt and half-starved, is scurrying down the beach towards you like a torrent of black water.</p>

<p>You wind your way through a labyrinth of tunnels, slipping on moss-covered rocks, grazing your head on low ceilings and scrambling up and down steep ridges and rockfalls until you arrive at a smooth-walled chamber carved with precision from the hard black rock.

A thorny jungle of briars climbs the walls with greedy claws, coiling around the rotten frames of paintings and weaving through damp and mouldering tapestries.</p>
<p>Suspended above the fireplace is a great Anarian broadsword, its pitted steel blade pointing to one side. Your eyes travel along the blade to the shadows of the fireplace, and you notice something lying in the grate. Moving nearer, you see that it is the body of a dead man. Behind it is a panel, wedged open by the corpse, and, peering into the gloomy opening, you can just make out some stairs disappearing down into the darkness.</p>

A criss-cross of interconnecting walkways is suspended above the maze by gigantic chains that vanish into blackness. You hurry along the iron path towards a staircase that descends to an arch beyond the boundary wall of the maze.

As you launch your attack, you see their features and realize that they cannot possibly be human. Great sloping shoulders support their unnaturally long arms; yellow-clawed hairy hands grip axes and spears of rough-wrought iron; and behind them swing long, tufted tails, like those of lions.</p>
<p>Your first blow shears through the backplate of the last warrior in the line, causing him to howl like a demon and collapse in a crumpled heap at your feet.

<p>You thread your way through a network of empty passages and chambers. Twice you are forced to hide when groups of black-armoured warriors appear unexpectedly. At first you think that they are Drakkarim, evil humans who serve the Darklords of Helgedad, but their unnaturally long arms and the tails that swing behind them soon dispel that fear, replacing it with a far greater one.</p>
<p>At the bottom of a narrow winding stairway, you arrive at a small but opulently furnished chamber, its walls hung with beautiful tapestries, undamaged by the damp that pervades the upper levels of the fortress. It looks as if you have reached a dead end, and you are about to turn back when you notice a small door tucked away in one corner of the room.</p>

<p>You strike the seething water with a mighty splash and sink like a stone. The sharp tang of the lake fills your mouth, and its icy cold embrace numbs your muscles. Your first impulse on hitting the water is to lash out with your arms and swim, but you are hampered by a mass of plant life that coils around your flailing limbs. Desperate for air, you hack blindly at the weeds that now threaten to drag you to a watery grave.</p>
<p>Fight the combat as normal. However, due to your lack of air, you must automatically deduct 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points for every round that you fight.</p>

<p>You leap forward and strike left and right, ripping through the startled guards and meeting little resistance. Two fall and a third steps forward, his sword yet to clear his scabbard. You hit him below the chin and see his beast-like eyes roll up in sudden agony as blood gushes from under his helmet.

There is a soft noise like rushing wind, and then, suddenly, the key vanishes from your grip (erase this Special Item from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>). Soundlessly, the great door swings open to reveal a plain stone room. You enter and, as the door closes, you notice a coiled snake etched deep into its surface.</p>

<p>‘Good!’ booms the voice of Zahda as you enter the passage; ‘the cowards of Elzian have at last sent a warrior worthy of my maze.’</p>
<p>The words conjure up a picture of Lord Zahda seated on his golden throne, with the object of your quest, the Lorestone of Herdos, suspended above it. The image strengthens your resolve to survive this accursed maze and escape. If you can then find your way back to Zahda’s throne-hall, the success of your quest will be within your grasp.</p>

<p>A rickety, hunchbacked creature, swathed in a hooded robe, approaches the platform on which you stand manacled to the wall. With an efficiency born of practice, quickly he strips you of all your weapons and hands them to an ugly-faced dwarf, hovering at his side. The dwarf looks at the Sommerswerd with an appraising eye, and then raises it above his head to show it to his master. Before he can speak, there is a sudden roar, as a bolt of golden energy engulfs the hilt. Screaming with pain, the dwarf drops the sword and cradles his smoking hand, his fingers now missing half their length. You are unable to hide your smile and are quickly punished for your insolence. The robed creature strikes you across the face, gashing your cheek with its rough, warty fist (lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point).</p>
<p>‘Take him to the maze,’ commands white-haired Lord Zahda, ‘and leave the sword for me.’</p>
<p>The Sommerswerd rises into the air and floats towards the golden throne on a cushion of blue mist.<sup><a href="#sect335-1-foot" name="sect335-1">13</a></sup> As you are dragged from the hall in chains, you are taunted by Zahda’s cruel laugh and the fear that your quest is now doomed to failure.</p>

<p>A new sound is added to the terrible squeals of the hungry rats: the sound of splintering wood. In less than a minute, your small boat is completely devoured, leaving no trace of its ever having existed. The jagged rocks cut into your hands and knees, but you are oblivious to the pain as you clamber across them to the beach beyond. You set off at a run, but the fine, black sand closes around your ankles, and your legs ache violently with every desperate step.</p>
<p>A glance over your shoulder warns you that the pack is gaining ground rapidly; they will be on you before you reach the rocky base of Kazan-Oud. Then suddenly the squealing stops; the black tide has halted at the edge of the beach. Their white teeth snap on empty air, and hungry eyes watch your every movement, but every single one of them is rooted to the rocks.</p>
<p>As you turn to make your escape, you wonder why the rats no longer pursue you. Less than ten feet ahead lies the horrific answer to your question.</p>

<p>Wisps of smoke are beginning to rise from the dead bodies; suddenly one bursts into flames. Quickly you leap across the slab, away from the heat and choking black fumes, as the others are swallowed by a fire that crackles and spits like an angry demon.</p>
<p>Further along the tunnel, you see the warrior. He is crouching on his heels, his hands resting on the hilt of his sword. A smile spreads across his unshaven face as he sees your approach. ‘You’re brave, I’ll grant you that. There’s none I know who’d stand against three hungry Dhax.’ He jumps to his feet, sheathes his sword, and offers his hand in friendship.</p>

<p>You tell him of your quest and the help the Elder Magi have given to enable you to enter Kazan-Oud. When you recount your air voyage to Herdos aboard Lord Paido’s skyship, you notice a tear trickle from the blind man’s eye. ‘My name is Kasin,’ he says, sorrowfully. ‘Lord Paido is my brother.’</p>
<p>Pity fills your heart for this unfortunate warrior, for you know that he is doomed to die. Blindness occurs in the final stage of takadea, the disease that is ravaging his body. ‘I am beyond help,’ he says, his face lined with pain, ‘but I can and will help your quest, Kai Lord. Listen to me carefully. There are stairs at the end of the corridor that lead down to the throne-hall of Zahda. At the entrance to the hall there is a tapestry behind which there is a secret passage. It leads to Zahda’s throne. Above the throne is the Lorestone you seek, but beware. Zahda has coupled its power to a Doomstone from the realm of Naaros—Zahda draws all his power from this accursed gem. If you are to succeed, you must first destroy the gem or you will surely perish. Sadly I cannot help you escape from Kazan-Oud, for I myself was captured long before I reached the surface, but if you reach the beach, make your way to the old stone jetty. Beneath the steps is the place where I hid my boat.’</p>
<p>He grips your hand in friendship, his face now calm and peaceful. ‘When you return to Elzian, tell my brother that my death was not in vain. May the gods protect you, Lone Wolf.’</p>
<p>The sound of approaching guards forces you to leave the cell. As you close the door, you promise that his bravery will live forever in the legends of the Vakeros—his warrior kin.</p>

<p>The blood of the dead wolf stains you from head to foot, filling your nose with an acrid smell.

A whistle, soft but chilling, gradually rises in pitch until it fills your head with agonizing pain. Your fingers tremble and, as your weapon slips from your grasp, a slit opens in the side of the brain. It is a mouth, broad and puffy, with an upper lip that hangs over the lower jaw like milk boiling over the pan. A long tendril of flesh emerges from the mouth and snakes through the air towards your throat.</p>

<p>Your hand strikes something invisible set close to the edge of the pit—the beginning of a magically hidden bridge. Your fingers tell you that it is a plank, for it feels very thin and narrow. Suddenly the footsteps halt. There is a piercing crack, like that of a whip, and an angry red weal opens across the back of your hand (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).

<p>The warrior makes no attempt to parry your attack, and your blow rips deeply into his unguarded chest. He stares at you in disbelief as he clutches at his wound and drops heavily to his knees. ‘Why?’ he croaks, as his eyelids flicker and close.</p>
<p>A howl of maniacal glee arises from the black creatures. As the warrior falls into the smoky abyss, they slink towards you with long, loping strides.</p>

<p>Desperately you tap the wall with the hilt of your weapon, praying for the dull, tell-tale thud of a thin or hollow partition through which you might effect an escape. The walls yield no such sound, but in the roof you discover an old trap-door hatch sealed off with bricks and mortar. The faint glimmer of light seeping through a hairline crack fills you with renewed hope.</p>
<p>With a flurry of blows the mortar crumbles and the bricks split and fall. Without waiting for the dust to settle, you climb through the jagged hole and emerge into a hall that is filled with a damp and earthy smell. Two rows of great stone pillars support the roof and a huge, granite sarcophagus stands in the centre of the floor. From within a black tunnel to your right, you hear the clanking of armour and the sound of approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>You snatch the Whistle to your lips and blow. Instantly, the slimy creature rears up, its short rubbery legs scrabbling the air in agony as the ultra high-pitched sound destroys its sensitive nervous system.</p>
<p>As it twists back on itself, its head disappears into the misty ceiling. There is an ear-splitting crack and blue lightning engulfs the creature, crackling snake-like around its neck, and filling the corridor with the stench of burning meat. The creature thrashes wildly for several minutes, and when its gruesome dance finally ends the canopy of mist is no longer there. In the darkness above, you see a walkway and an observation platform.</p>

<p>Shortly you arrive at another stone staircase. This one is intact, however, and ascends to a cave-like entrance in the sheer rock wall. You cannot follow the beach any further, for a salient of the wall blocks your way. Moreover, the weather is getting worse with every passing minute and you need to seek shelter from the coming storm.</p>
<p>By the time you have climbed all the way to the cave, the storm has broken. As you stand in the entrance, the rain-filled wind lashes you mercilessly and the ground shudders with every clap of thunder. The faint green glow of the power-shield is the only source of light, and you enter cautiously. You are soon swallowed up by darkness and your progress becomes painfully slow.</p>

<p>As soon as you step into the ruby corridor, the horseshoe arch turns completely opaque. You try to go back, but the milky-white barrier will not let you pass. Soon, the skull appears once more, but this time its message chills you to the core:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
        ‘The path you have chosen leads to the heart of the maze,<br />
        And there you are doomed to eke out your days.’<br />
       </p>

</blockquote>
<p>It is a prophecy that will be fulfilled. You have ventured too deep into Zahda’s maze, and the exits are now closed off forever. It may interest you to learn that you survived at the core of the maze for three weeks, a feat that earned you the respect of Lord Zahda, but one that did not persuade him to spare you your life.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect350">350</a></h3>

<p>As soon as you have passed through the power-shield, you are greeted like a hero by a huge flotilla of fishing vessels and trading barges. An hour ago, upon seeing the eruption of Kazan-Oud, every boat in Herdos set sail for the shield, for the eruption signalled the end of the bane that had haunted Dessi for hundreds of years. Now they cheer the Sommlending warrior who has delivered them from Dessi’s evil shadow. Eager hands pull you aboard Lord Ardan’s caravel, and a fanfare salute is sounded by the trumpeters of his Vakeros guards.</p>
<p>‘We are forever in your debt, Lone Wolf,’ says Lord Ardan, as he shakes your hand warmly in gratitude and friendship. ‘You have achieved what we feared to be impossible, and you live to tell the tale. Your bravery is an inspiration to us all.’ His words are reinforced by the delirious cheers of his people. He asks of your own quest, and, when you remove the Lorestone of Herdos from the pocket of your tattered and scorched tunic, his eyes widen with amazement.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XX]</div>
<p>He bows his head and says in a solemn and respectful voice, ‘My lord, you stand upon the threshold of greatness. Your purpose and your destiny are known to the Elder Magi, for we have awaited your coming for many thousands of years. Our survival and the survival of all we cherish rests on the success of your Magnakai quest. The time has come, Lone Wolf, for you to learn our wisdom, for we are of the same blood, you and I, and our fate is bound together. We will prepare you for your next quest, for the Lorestone you must find next exists in the land that was once our home, in the temple that was once our most sacred place of worship, in the chamber where our master first appeared to us.’</p>
<p>Your quest has succeeded, for the strength and wisdom of the Lorestone of Herdos is now a part of your body and spirit. But there is much for you to learn from the Elder Magi as they prepare you for the most challenging of the Magnakai quests you have yet to attempt, a quest that will take you deep into the hostile swamps of the Danarg, where the evil creatures of Agarash the Damned still thrive and dominate the land.</p>
<p>If you have the courage of a true Kai Master, the secrets of the Elder Magi and the perils of the Danarg await you in Book 8 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series entitled:</p>

A regular hexagon (i.e. a six-sided shape with all sides of equal length and all angles equal) is divided into six equal triangles by three lines which extend from each corner to its opposite (i.e. one line for each of three pairs of opposite corners). A larger triangle is formed from the hexagon by placing three triangles (of the same size and shape as the triangles in the hexagon) next to three alternating sides of the hexagon (i.e. if the sides of the hexagon are numbered 1–6, then the sides of the triangles should be attached to sides 2, 4, and 6).</p>
<p>Alternately, the plaque could be formed from equilateral triangles (i.e. triangles with three equal sides) in the following way. A single triangle is placed on the plaque with one of its corners pointing down. Three new triangles are attached to the sides of the first triangle. The result so far should resemble a large triangle with one corner pointing up. Two more small triangles (pointing down) are attached to the bottom of this large triangle. Finally, three new triangles (pointing up) are attached to the latest two so that, all together, the plaque forms one large triangle.</p>
<p>The final, triangular plaque has five interlocking rows of small triangles. Starting from the top, it has a row of one triangle pointing up, a row of one triangle pointing down, a row of two triangles pointing up, a row of two triangles pointing down, and a row of three triangles pointing up.</p>
