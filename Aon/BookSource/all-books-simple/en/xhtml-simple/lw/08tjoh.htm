<div class="frontmatter">

  <p>You are Lone Wolf—the last Kai Master of Sommerlund—sworn avenger of your forefathers, the Kai Lords. To achieve your vow you must find the Lorestone of Ohrido, known to be hidden in the jungle-swamps of the Danarg. Guided by Lord Paido, warrior-magician of Dessi, you set off across the war-torn lands of Talestria on your vital secret mission. But your quest is soon endangered when your identity is discovered by agents of your mortal enemies—the Darklords of Helgedad. Can you survive the assassins of Gnaag, the armies of Warlord Zegron, and the Chaos-creatures of Agarash the Damned? Will you fall foul of their evil schemes, or will you defeat them and fulfil your destiny?</p>

 
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


     <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power, known as the Lorestones of Nyxator. On discovering them he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and experiences in a great tome entitled The Book of the Magnakai. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over one thousand years ago and find the Lorestones of Nyxator. By doing so, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai, which is held within the Lorestones’ crystal forms.</p>
<p>Already your quest has taken you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master, you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians who aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that one of the seven Lorestones was still present in their land, hidden deep within the island stronghold known as Kazan-Oud—Castle Death. In the years since Sun Eagle first came to Dessi, the fortress of Kazan-Oud had become the abode of a great but evil sorcerer called Zahda. The Elder Magi, realizing the danger of Zahda’s increasing power, attempted to destroy Kazan-Oud, but they failed. In desperation they constructed a prison of energy around the fortress to prevent Zahda from ever escaping. Steadily, however, his power grew and the people of Dessi lived in fear of the day when he would break free and wreak his vengeance upon them. When you resolved to enter Kazan-Oud to retrieve the Lorestone, the Elder Magi rejoiced, for the success of your quest would bring about the destruction of Zahda and put an end to the bane that had haunted Dessi for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>You survived the perils of Castle Death and emerged triumphant, achieving that which the Elder Magi had believed to be impossible. During the victory celebrations held in your honour you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had been expecting your coming. An ancient Dessi legend tells of the birth and rise to greatness of two <i xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</i>—‘sons of the sun’. One was named <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</i>, which means ‘eagle’; the other was called <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</i>, which means ‘wolf’. A prophecy foretold that the <i xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</i> would come from the north to seek the council of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose, and one destiny—to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril.</p>
<p>At the Temple of Truth in Elzian, the magnificent capital city of Dessi, the Elder Magi prepared you for the next stage of the Magnakai quest. Lord Rimoah, the speaker of the High Council, tutored you in the ancient histories of Magnamund, and you received lessons in lore that you would have learned from the Kai Masters if only they had survived the attack by the murderous Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>The Lorestone you must find now lies hidden in a temple in the centre of a jungle-swamp known as the Danarg. In ancient times this huge area, once the crater of a massive volcano, was controlled by a powerful lord of evil called Agarash the Damned. The Elder Magi defeated him in a war that lasted one thousand years and, in the wake of his destruction, they turned the Danarg crater into a rich and fertile paradise, the perfect setting for their most sacred place of worship—the Temple of Ohrido. The Danarg flourished until a great plague befell the Elder Magi and decimated their race. They were forced to abandon the Danarg and seek refuge in Dessi. Slowly the Danarg was consumed by a creeping mire, which swallowed or poisoned all healthy forms of life. The crater became a sanctuary for a host of evil creatures who thrived in the fetid waters and fought for control of the treacherous shifting mud flats. Many came from the barren hills of Ogia, but many more awoke from lairs deep beneath the crater where they had lain dormant since the defeat of their master, Agarash the Damned, eight thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Now the time for study has passed and the time for swift action has arrived. Grim news from the west prompts the Elder Magi to cease their counselling and arrange for your immediate passage to the Danarg. In the Darklord city of Helgedad a civil war has raged for five years following your defeat of Haakon, Archlord of the Black City. Now, a new lord sits upon the throne of Helgedad—Darklord Gnaag of Mozgôar.</p>
<p>‘The Darklords are united behind their new leader,’ reports Lord Rimoah solemnly to his fellow elders of the High Council. ‘And they are hungry for conquest and revenge. Their strength grows with each passing day. We dare delay no longer.’</p>
<p>Silently the members of the High Council rise from their seats and turn to face you. No sounds reach your ears, yet the words of their blessing fill your mind.</p>
<p>‘May the Gods Ishir and Kai protect you on your journey into darkness, <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Kor-Skarn</i>,’ they intone.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to Book 8. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You may choose one bonus <a href="#discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> adventure you successfully complete (books 6–12).</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Magnakai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
<p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called ‘Lore-circles’. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. (See the section ‘<a href="#lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a>’ for details of these bonuses.)</p>
<p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wpnmstry">Weaponmastery</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 3 to any number that you choose from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Short Sword</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>Axe</li>
<li>Sword</li>
<li>Quarterstaff</li>
<li>Broadsword</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that you are skilled with three weapons does not mean that you begin the adventure carrying any of them. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons during your adventure. For every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> book that you complete in the Magnakai series, you may add an additional weapon to your <a href="#action">Weaponmastery Checklist</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponmastery: +3 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, and tick your chosen weapons on the <a href="#action">Weapons List</a>. You cannot carry more than two Weapons.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlctrl">Animal Control</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to communicate with most animals and to determine their purpose and intentions. It also enables a Kai Master to fight from the saddle with great advantage.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Control’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="curing">Curing</a></h4>

<p>The possessor of this skill can restore 1 lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to his total for every numbered section of the book through which he passes, provided he is not involved in combat. (This can only be done after his <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) This Magnakai Discipline also enables a Kai Master to cure disease, blindness, and any combat wounds sustained by others, as well as himself. Using the knowledge that mastery of this skill provides will also allow a Kai Master to identify the properties of any herbs, roots, and potions that may be encountered during the adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Curing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="invsblty">Invisibility</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai skill allows a Kai Master to blend in with his surroundings, even in the most exposed terrain. It will enable him to mask his body heat and scent and to adopt the dialect and mannerisms of any town or city that he visits.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Invisibility’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hntmstry">Huntmastery</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Master will never starve in the wild; he will always be able to hunt for food, even in areas of wasteland and desert. It also enables a Kai Master to move with great speed and dexterity and will allow him to ignore any extra loss of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points due to a surprise attack or ambush.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Huntmastery’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="pthmnshp">Pathsmanship</a></h4>

<p>In addition to the basic skill of being able to recognize the correct path in unknown territory, the Magnakai skill of Pathsmanship will enable a Kai Master to read foreign languages, decipher symbols, read footprints and tracks (even if they have been disturbed), and detect the presence of most traps. It also grants him the gift of always knowing intuitively the direction in which north lies.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Pathsmanship’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psisurge">Psi-surge</a></h4>

<p>This psychic skill enables a Kai Master to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used as well as normal combat weapons and adds 4 extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. A weaker form of Psi-surge called <cite>Mindblast</cite> can be used against an enemy without losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, but it will add only 2 extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. (Psi-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.) Psi-surge cannot be used if your <small>ENDURANCE</small> falls to 6 points or below, and not all of the creatures encountered on your adventure will be affected by it; you will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Psi-surge: +4 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points but −2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points per round’ and ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psiscrn">Psi-screen</a></h4>

<p>Many of the hostile creatures that inhabit Magnamund have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack and greatly increases your defence against supernatural illusions and hypnosis.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Psi-screen: no points lost when attacked by Mindforce’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="nexus">Nexus</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Magnakai skill will enable you to withstand extremes of heat and cold without losing <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and to move items by your powers of concentration alone.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Nexus’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="dvnation">Divination</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Master of imminent or unseen danger, or enable him to detect an invisible or hidden enemy. It may also reveal the true purpose or intent of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure. Divination may enable you to communicate telepathically with another person and to sense if a creature possesses psychic abilities.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Divination’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 8 of the <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> series</strong>, you may add a further Magnakai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="../lw/09tcof.htm#title">Book 9</a>. This additional skill, together with your other Magnakai skills and any Special Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be used in the next adventure, which is called <a href="../lw/09tcof.htm#title"><cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before leaving Dessi on your journey to the Danarg, the Elder Magi give you a <a href="#map">map of the jungle-swamp</a> and its surrounding lands, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed books 1–7 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. You can carry a maximum of only fifty Crowns, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.</p>
<p>The Elder Magi offer you a choice of equipment to aid you on your perilous mission. You can take five items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess. However, remember that you can carry a maximum of two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bow (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows. Tick them off as they are used.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Rope (Backpack Items)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Items) This potion restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for only one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Lantern (Backpack Items)<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">1</a></sup><br /><br />
</li>
<li>Mace (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>3 Meals (Meals) Each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>3 Fireseeds (Special Items) When thrown against a hard surface, these Fireseeds explode and burn fiercely.<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>List the five items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You do not need to make notes but you can refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Bow—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Quiver—slung over your shoulder.</li>

<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember that you can only carry two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bow and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is strongly recommended that you also equip yourself with a close combat weapon, like a Sword or Mace.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
If you enter combat armed only with a Bow, you must deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at anytime.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, you may already possess Special Items.<br /><br />
The maximum number of Special Items that a Kai Master can carry during an adventure is twelve. Any additional items may be left for safekeeping at the Kai Monastery.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>No form of currency is used in the Danarg. However, you will be able to use Gold Crowns during your journey through the land of Talestria. There the unit of currency is the Lune, but Gold Crowns are readily accepted at an exchange rate of four Lune for every one Gold Crown.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 19.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Nightstalker’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (19 − 22 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as −3. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
<li>Nightstalker loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Magnakai Training</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles that are achieved by Kai Masters at each stage of their training. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> series, you will gain an additional Magnakai Discipline and progress towards the ultimate distinction of a Kai Warrior—Kai Grand Mastership.</p>

<h3><a name="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></h3>

<p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called ‘Lore-circles’. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>), and their physical and mental stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
<p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
<dd>Weaponmastery &amp; Huntmastery</dd>
<dt>Circle of Light</dt>
<dd>Animal Control &amp; Curing</dd>
<dt>Circle of Solaris</dt>
<dd>Invisibility, Huntmastery &amp; Pathsmanship</dd>
<dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
<dd>Psi-surge, Psi-screen, Nexus &amp; Divination</dd>
</dl>
<p>By completing a Lore-circle, you may add to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> the extra bonus points that are shown below.</p>
<h4><a name="lcbonus">Lore-circle Bonuses</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
<dd>+1 <small>CS</small>+2 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of Light</dt>
<dd>0 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of Solaris</dt>
<dd>+1 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
<dd>+3 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>All bonus points that you acquire by completing a Lore-circle are additions to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores.</p>
<h3><a name="imprvdsc">Improved Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>As you rise through the levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills) or Tutelary (five skills) you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>
<h4><a name="primate">Primate</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Primates with this Magnakai Discipline will be able to repel an animal that is intent on harming them by blocking its sense of taste and smell. The level of success is dependent on the size and ferocity of the animal.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill will have the ability to delay the effect of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison, he will be able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and are able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Primates with the skill of Nexus will be able to offer a far greater resistance than before to the effects of noxious gases and fumes.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="tutelary">Tutelary</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to use defensive combat skills to great effect when fighting unarmed. When entering combat without a weapon, you will lose only 2 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, instead of the usual 4 points.</dd>
<dt>Invisibility</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to increase the effectiveness of their skill by drawing the enemy’s attention to a place other than that in which they are hiding. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill can detect an enemy ambush within 500 yards of their position unless their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score is low due to wounds sustained or lack of food.</dd>
<dt>Psi-screen</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill develop mental defences against magical charms and hostile telepathy. These defences increase in strength as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Divination</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries who possess this Magnakai Discipline are able to recognize objects or creatures with magical skills or abilities, although they may not be able to if the creature or object is shielded from detection.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Magnakai Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Magnakai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>The quest for the Lorestone of Ohrido will be fraught with danger, for the temple in which it lies is situated deep within the Danarg. Make notes as you progress through the story—they will be of great help in this and future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will help you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>Choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak his initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.</p>
<p>May the spirit of your ancestors guide you on the path of the Magnakai.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>You leave Elzian under cover of darkness on a trading ship bound for Garthen. It is a trim vessel, lean-prowed and simple in design—one of a thousand such ships that sail the chain of land-locked seas and lakes dividing the northern and southern continents of Magnamund. Its passage along this great waterway called the Tentarias is unlikely to invite undue attention, and it is for this reason that the Elder Magi have placed you aboard. The nature of your voyage is secret, but you are not alone, for a guide has been chosen to accompany you on your dangerous mission. His name is Paido, a tall, ebony-skinned Vakeros, who is a master of the art of battle-magic. Among his fellow warriors he is a high-ranking lord, respected and honoured for his bravery and skill on the field of battle. Now, for the mission that lies ahead, he has exchanged his gold and scarlet robes for the clothes of a commoner, a roving adventurer with a sword for hire. It is a disguise you too have adopted to veil your true identity on the long voyage to the land of Talestria, where a rendezvous with royalty awaits you.</p>
<p>You sail westwards, a benevolent wind filling the triangular sail and skimming the ship across the still, blue waters. The hull seems to slide over the surface of the water rather than cut its way through, and you cannot help but wonder if Paido has conjured some magic to speed your passage. Your first port of call is the city of Talon, where food stocks and fresh water are replenished. Then the voyage continues along the Tentarias to the port of Orello, the last stopping place before your ship-bound journey ends at Garthen—crown capital of Talestria.</p>
<p>It is an hour past midnight when you dock at Varnos Harbour in Garthen, a sprawling network of quays and cracked stone jetties that shelter great fleets of merchants, traders, and dhows. Silently like a shadow, you disembark and follow Paido through the twisting harbour streets, slowly climbing the steep stairs that connect one level of Garthen to the next. Rusty lanterns cast pools of yellow light beneath the timbered balconies, illuminating the stalls of merchants and vendors who will haggle, brag, and barter in the crowded streets till dawn. Paido halts at an iron-shod door and raps the grille with the hilt of his blue-steel sword. A man’s face appears, stern and handsome, with smooth dark hair and keen, intelligent eyes. A smile of recognition softens his lordly features when he sees Paido. In an instant the door swings open and you are ushered inside.</p>
<p>The man’s name is Adamas, Lord Constable of the Royal Citadel, protector and cousin of Queen Evaine of Talestria. For centuries a strong bond of friendship has existed between the royal household and the magicians of Dessi, and when called upon by the Elder Magi to help you in your quest, Queen Evaine pledged her support without hesitation. She has volunteered the services of Lord Adamas, who is to ensure your safe and unhindered passage through Talestria to the borders of the Danarg. At dawn, after snatching a few hours’ sleep, you are taken by coach to the east city wharf, where an empty corn barge is waiting to ferry you up-river. Haulage is provided by eight large ghorkas—hairy, ox-like creatures from the plains of Slovia—which are harnessed to the barge by chains. They lumber along the cobbled towpath, continually kept in line by the stinging lash of the barge owner’s zull-hide whip. The next day the barge arrives at a small river village called Lona, where a detachment of Lord Adamas’ cavalry, resplendent in surcoats of scarlet and grey, provide you with horses for the cross-country journey to the fortified city of Phoena.</p>
<p>Ill news greets you in Phoena, the city of triple towers. Zegron, warlord of Xanar, ruler of the barren highlands of Ogia, has amassed an army of Drakkarim warriors. Three days ago they attacked the border town of Luukos to the north. The Talestrian garrison put up a brave and spirited defence, but they were hopelessly outnumbered by the bloodthirsty Ogian horde that drove through the perimeter walls with battering rams and engines of war. The Drakkarim razed Luukos to the ground, and only a handful of survivors escaped to tell of the dreadful battle.</p>
<p>‘The situation is grave,’ reports Lord Adamas, on returning from an emergency conclave of his fellow Talestrian knights. ‘For decades Zegron and his minions have raided our northern territories, but never before with such determination and strength. We must mobilize our army for war, for it is war that Ogia has invited by its unforgivable attack on Luukos. I must return to Garthen to muster my retainers in preparation for battle and inform the Queen of the evil that threatens her realm. I can no longer escort you to the Danarg, though your quest must proceed in spite of all that conspires against it.’</p>
<p>He sends for his scribe, who arrives with helpers laden with the paraphernalia of his craft. He dictates an order of safe conduct and sets the impression of his signet ring into the hot wax seal before passing the parchment to you.</p>
<p>‘Our northern people are a frontier breed, wary and suspicious of strangers. If challenged, show this Pass and your safe passage will be assured by all who are loyal to Queen Evaine.’ (Mark this Pass<sup><a href="#sect1-1-foot" name="sect1-1">2</a></sup> on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry tucked inside your tunic.)</p>
<p>Early next morning Lord Adamas accompanies you and Paido to the main square of Phoena; it is from here that your quest begins. The first leg of your journey to the Danarg will take you north to the town of Tharro which nestles in the fertile uplands of Talestria. There are two ways of reaching the town: you can travel by road or you can take a barge along the River Phoen. Consult the <a href="#map">map</a> before deciding which route to take.</p>

<p>‘Well done,’ he says, ‘you are right. If the brick counterbalances three-quarters of a brick plus three-quarters of a pound, then a quarter of a brick must weigh three-quarters of a pound. The whole brick must weigh four times as much as this, which is, of course, three pounds.’</p>

<p>For little more than a second the space between you and your target clears. You release your Arrow and it hurtles towards the necromancer’s head. His death looks imminent, but he has escaped far greater threats than this. With a sudden sweep of his arm he parries the Arrow with the hilt of his rapier, and the Arrow disintegrates in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>As you unsheathe the sun-sword, a shimmering pulse of golden flame engulfs the blade from hilt to tip. Your attackers hesitate as the pure light washes over their hellish faces.

<p>A stronger pulse and the appearance of sweat on his brow are the first two outward signs of Paido’s recovery. Slowly he stirs to consciousness, waking from a sleep that was so nearly his last. He can remember nothing of the ordeal, and when you tell him what has happened he shakes his head in disbelief. ‘A Helghast?’ he says, incredulous. ‘How can that be?’</p>
<p>‘The servants of Darklord Gnaag have infiltrated this monastery,’ you reply. ‘They have kept themselves hidden, but I fear the day fast approaches when they will rise up and wreak their havoc. Already they know our true identities, and I wager they know why we’re here.’</p>
<p>‘This is bitter news, Lone Wolf,’ says Paido, his face etched with worry. ‘We can afford to delay no longer. If Talestria falls to Darklord Gnaag before we reach the Danarg, then the quest is lost.’</p>
<p>It is a sobering thought, but you do not dwell on it. Quickly you help Paido to his feet and cast your eyes around the cellar in search of another exit.</p>

<p>The liquid fire tears into the Levitron’s rail, twisting and melting the shiny alloy as it cuts into the hull. Two more of the Kraan swoop in and hover above the prow.

<p>‘What business have you here after sundown?’ growls one, the shorter and fatter of the two.</p>
<p>‘We would like to see your commanding officer,’ replies Paido, in a tone befitting his lordly rank. Unfortunately, neither his tone nor his travel-stained tunic impresses the surly soldiers. They refuse to grant his request out of hand.</p>

<p>‘A lucky guess,’ he says, a little flustered at the thought of losing 20 Lune. ‘Perhaps our friend can explain how he arrived at his answer.’ You reply that the answer is simple: if one and a half geese lay one and a half eggs in one and a half days, it therefore follows that three geese would lay three eggs in one and a half days, or two eggs in one day. Thus, in eight days, three geese would lay sixteen eggs.</p>
<p>The crowd applaud your display of logic, much to the chagrin of Count Conundrum, who parts reluctantly with 20 Lune. (Record the Lune in the Belt Pouch section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>—20 Lune take up the same space as 5 Gold Crowns.)</p>

<p>In the distance you see a pall of dense, black smoke rising into the sky. At its base a fortress wall and a cluster of cottages are feeding the greedy flames. Syada burns. To the north of the doomed town an army of black-clad troops covers the hills. The black wolf-head banners of Ogia sway on long poles, fluttering grimly above the ranks of the merciless horde.</p>

<p>Many years ago, this craft sailed the Tentarias, carrying cargoes of corn and linen to markets in the east. Now, old and leaky, it serves in retirement as a ferry for the farmers and settlers in the north.</p>
<p>The cabin was once luxurious, but it is now a cluttered mess of decaying junk. The sweet smell of pitch and damp timber hangs in the air, and patches of mould colour the walls.</p>

<p>The stable is full of fine horses, all of them as sound and sturdy as the mounts given to you by Lord Adamas. Paido acts as lookout while you saddle up two black stallions. You are making the final adjustments to their bridles when Paido hisses a warning. ‘Four monks coming this way!’</p>
<p>You mount your fresh steeds and gallop out of the stables, scattering the startled monks, who had just reached the door. In an act of desperation, one of the monks unsheathes his sword and hurls it at your back. The deadly blade spins through the air with alarming accuracy.</p>

<p>Shafts of sunlight break through the slate-grey cloud, and the rain eases off and finally stops. You ride across the rolling valley floor towards the River Phoen until the track stops at a ramshackle house perched precariously on the river bank. An old wooden jetty juts out from the side of the house, its platform almost submerged in the rain-swollen river. A notice board standing in front of the house reads:</p>

<p>You arrive at a mound where a tree bearing blood-red fruit overhangs a pool of crystal-clear water. You stop to rest and to dislodge the tiny leeches that are feasting on your legs.</p>
<p>Paido climbs the tree to scan the horizon. He carries with him a starguider, a homing device invented by the Elder Magi to enable their flying ships to navigate in the dark. It is sensitive to the vibrations given off by korlinium crystals. The spire of the Temple of Ohrido is solid korlinium, and the Elder Magi have set Paido’s starguider to home in on the vibrations emitted by the spire. By following the direction of the signals, it is hoped that you will be able to find the lost temple.</p>

<p>A breathtaking agony engulfs you as three sharpened spearheads penetrate your rib cage. You turn to Paido, your hands outstretched, your eyes wide with pain. He lunges forward in a desperate bid to catch you as you fall but he too is struck down by thrusting spears. Amid the sounds of chaos and confusion, you slip unwillingly into the waiting arms of death.</p>

<p>Long streamers of moss-covered vines hang down the red rock wall in huge numbers, inviting you to climb onto the plateau above. After the uncertain ground of the swamp, the hard, jagged rock is a welcome relief. You make good progress, reaching the top just as the sun is sinking into a sea of scarlet mist that shrouds the eastern Danarg. In the failing light, you discover a trail that winds northwards through the knee-high foliage.</p>

<p>A ghastly transformation is taking place before your eyes. The monk’s face is writhing and contorting as the skin tightens and grows darker. Tattered flesh drops from his sunken cheeks to hang in festoons beneath the exposed jawbone. A sickening dread fills your heart as you recognize the creature standing before you. It is a Helghast, a nightmarish agent of the Darklords. Its demonic eyes glow like red-hot coals as it shrieks and raises its long black staff.</p>

<p>Paido dismounts and peers through a cracked window set into the rough stone base of the mill. ‘Looks deserted,’ he comments, his sharp eyes probing the gloomy interior.</p>
<p>‘How about up there,’ you suggest, pointing to a platform that juts out from the side. Paido climbs a rickety wooden staircase that clings precariously to the mouldering stonework. Just as he reaches the top, he halts in mid-step. Slowly he raises his hands above his head: he must be in danger.</p>

<p>The arrival of the swamp python frightened away the crawling denizens of the mire, but now they are returning to satisfy their curiosity. Hordes of slithering lizard-beasts gather at the edge of the floating morass, inching their way nearer as they assess your strengths and weaknesses.

<p>Seconds later you hear the crash of broken furniture as a fight breaks out inside the cabin. Paido has surprised your would-be assailant, and the two of them are now locked in hand-to-hand combat. Abruptly the noise ceases, and Paido appears at the front door, sweating and dishevelled, his sword bloodied in his hand.</p>
<p>‘Where have you been?’ he asks, stepping aside to allow you to enter. A scar-faced man lies dead on the floor, a wooden stave lying across his chest. ‘Come and see what I’ve found in the back room,’ says Paido, leading the way.</p>
<p>Small sacks, each filled with nuggets of silver, are stacked in a huge mound that reaches almost to the ceiling. ‘No wonder he fought so desperately,’ you say, staring at this treasure hoard. ‘There’s enough silver here to pay a king’s ransom.’</p>

<p>Quietly you agree upon a plan of action. Paido and Trost will approach the necromancer while you guard the stairs. If he should evade your companions, he’ll have you to contend with before he can escape from the hold.</p>
<p>Unhurriedly, you leave your seat and walk to the tap-room stairs. When you are in position your companions rise and advance towards the stranger who remains motionless, seemingly engrossed in his black book. Trost draws his sword and challenges the man, demanding that he state his name and the purpose of his journey. It is a fatal mistake. The man looks up from his book, his grey eyes suddenly aglow with a terrible red fire. Trost screams. His face has become a mass of horrible, erupting boils. As he falls to the floor, Paido strikes, his sword a shimmering lance of blue steel forged by the Elder Magi. His attack is lightning fast, but the necromancer counters his blow on the edge of his blade. Sparks explode, showering the tap-room with glowing fragments. The crowd begins to cheer, but their cheers turn to screams of terror when the necromancer summons a new defence.</p>

<p>Paido opens his palm to reveal the small gold coin: it shows heads. ‘Bad luck!’ he exclaims with a grin. ‘You take the first watch.’ He settles himself down on the mound of spongy earth and is soon asleep, snoring softly. You sit beside him, your eyes scouring the black spaces between the ghostly grey trees.</p>
<p>The first half of the night passes uneventfully. In need of rest, you are about to awaken Paido when you sense something moving in the shadows off to your right. Two tiny pinpoints of yellow light blink in the darkness. You draw your weapon, expecting an attack, but you can no longer see the eyes of the shadow creature. Paido wakes and takes over the watch, but the lingering feeling that you are being observed makes you uneasy and disturbs your rest (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). Four hours later, you wake to the gloomy grey of dawn and prepare to set off once more.</p>

<p>You take cover behind the pulpit and focus your skill on a corner at the far end of the hall. Two hunting dogs run through the curtained archway and stop in the middle of the aisle, as if waiting for their handlers to catch up. Seconds later a group of monks appear, each armed with a sword. They approach the far corner and search it thoroughly, certain that the pews harbour you and your companion. When they discover them empty, they quickly leave the hall and descend the stairs, their baying hounds in tow.</p>

<p>Suddenly you are hit in the back and propelled into the yawning chasm. Paido, who was following closely on your heels, has rammed into you and sent you tumbling over the edge. As you plummet to your doom, you hear his scream of anguish, echoing in the void.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect70">70</a></h3>

<p>Paido kicks open the side door and rushes out into the storm with you close on his heels. A grimy-faced farmer blocks the passage beyond, a pitchfork wobbling in his clumsy hands. Paido emits a shout far louder than you ever imagined could be made by a human voice. The force of the shout hits the man in the chest and slams him to the muddy ground like a limp rag doll.</p>
<p>‘Vakeros power-word,’ explains Paido, in answer to your unspoken question. ‘Someday I’ll teach you the technique, Kai Lord.’</p>
<p>A handful of plains folk, clutching rakes and hoes, are waiting for you at the stable door. But, after seeing the fate that befell their leader, they throw down their improvised weapons and melt into the storm.</p>

<p>Waiting on the other corner is a small wagon. Its canvas cover is threadbare and patched in a score of places. It is harnessed to a pair of moth-eaten old mules and a driver sits holding their reins, his features hidden by a hooded black robe.

<p>Stepping through the door is like stepping into another world. The air is sweet with incense and the flickering light, cast by a long row of squat red candles, does little to illuminate the interior. You follow the old man along a vaulted corridor, down several flights of stairs, and finally into a torchlit refectory. A delicious smell of cooking wafts from an open hatch in the wall together with the sounds of people in the kitchen beyond.</p>

<p>‘In the name of the gods, what’s happened here?’ thunders the captain as he hurries down the tap-room stairs. A crowd of passengers huddle in his wake, frightened but curious to discover the outcome of the fight that has devastated the hold. ‘I’ll see you pay for this,’ he blusters. ‘It’ll cost hundreds of Lune to fix this damage. Pay up now or I’ll take it out of your hides!’</p>
<p>Paido snatches the cloth from a nearby table and scoops up the head of Kezoor, wrapping and tying it tightly with cord. He tosses this gruesome package to the captain, together with the notice of death that lies beside Trost’s scorched body. ‘That’ll pay for the damage, captain,’ says Paido, ‘and be sure that the balance goes to the family of this brave soldier or we’ll take it out of <em>your</em> hide!’</p>
<p>As the captain reads the scroll a wry grin spreads slowly across his weather-worn face. ‘So, Kezoor met his doom aboard my barge,’ he says, thoughtfully. ‘Maybe I’ll leave the hold just as it is. There’s plenty o’ folk who’d pay to see the place where this rogue ended his days.’</p>

<p>The blood pounds in your ears as you gallop towards the onrushing warriors. There is a mighty crash, and suddenly you are in the thick of the battle. Steel bites steel and the curses and cries of the enemy ring loudly in your ears as you fight desperately to survive. You swing in the saddle and fell a warrior with a crushing blow to his chest, ducking an instant later as a spiked mace whistles past your head. Paido dispatches its wielder, running him through with his blue-steel blade. Their leader bellows an order and they pull away, standing off a dozen paces to regroup and recover. Paido reins his horse to your side as the bronze-helmed warrior lord yells his battle-cry: <i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Shaag Drakkarim!’</i></p>

<p>As you descend the steps of the Ferry House, Paido catches sight of something glinting in the distance.</p>
<p>‘It’s the barge,’ he says, shielding his eyes from the sun which is shining at last. A team of bedraggled ghorkas are hauling the vessel upstream, seemingly unaffected by the storm-strengthened flow. Eventually the barge arrives at the jetty and stops to allow a motley assortment of peasants and travellers to disembark.</p>

<p>Twilight is approaching. As the sky above darkens, a black bird flies among the upper branches, emitting a shrill cry, which sounds unnaturally loud in the silent forest. It settles, stares at you for a few minutes, and then flaps away. A little later you stumble upon a clearing. Shafts of ghostly moonlight pour through a gap in the black canopy of leaves, revealing a mound of earth, rising out of the forest mist. You are both exhausted after the day’s events and agree to stop here to rest. Paido takes a Gold Crown from his pocket and tosses it in the air to decide who should take the first watch. ‘Heads or tails?’ he asks, the Crown clenched in his fist.</p>

<p>You sense that the guard has taken a dislike to you.

<p>You climb the steps to the pulpit as swiftly as you are able and rest Paido in the recess behind its sword-shaped facia. By chance his tunic snags on a hidden lever and, as his body slumps over, the lever is pulled to one side. Suddenly the floor of the pulpit shudders and begins to descend into a secret passage beneath the hall.</p>
<p>Carefully you pull Paido off the platform and raise him into a sitting position, his back against the passage wall. Slowly the platform rises back into the pulpit. In the silence of this secret passage all you can hear is the shallow breathing of your unconscious companion. You lift one of his eyelids and note that the almond-shaped iris is fully dilated.

<p>The cloying smell in the cabin is unbearable and soon forces you to return to the deck to clear your lungs. From there you see the captain walking along the river bank inspecting his team of long-haired ghorkas. Stoically they haul the barge upstream, rarely faltering as they tread the rutted and pot-holed towpath. Beyond the bank lies an incredible array of colourful wild flowers—scarlet lankpetal, yellow podlumes, and violet mellowroots of towering proportions. Their perfume soon dispels the lingering odour in the cabin.</p>
<p>The colourful fields suddenly give way to rolling acres of grassy plain, and gradually the sky grows darker until just a slender streak of light fringes the horizon. It is not long before a roll of thunder echoes across the plain.</p>
<p>‘Storm brewing,’ shouts the captain, as the first drops of rain splash the deck. ‘You two best take shelter below.’ You baulk at the thought of returning to the dank and dismal cabin. Paido suggests a visit to the tap-room and offers to buy you ale. It is an offer that sounds too good to refuse.</p>

<p>The monk utters a thin but chilling laugh in reply to your demand.</p>
<p>‘What do you want with us?’ shouts Paido, his voice sharp and threatening. But the monk offers no reply. Instead he stands motionless and silent, his eyes fixed firmly on you. Paido repeats his demand, but his voice is weaker. The sword is now trembling in his hand. With a groan he collapses scattering plates and cutlery as he hits the table and crashes to the floor.</p>

<p>The great doors close with a whisper. You follow Paido along a corridor of gleaming silvery metal that dazzles your eyes to a hall carved from solid crystal. Icicles of diamond hang from its ceiling and reflect in a floor set with mosaics of a thousand shimmering squares.</p>
<p>‘Approach the crystal dais, Lone Wolf,’ instructs Paido, pointing to a radiant circular plateau of pure quartz.</p>
<p>But even as his words leave his lips you are already walking towards the plinth, drawn by a strange compulsion. You mount the dais and a flood of golden light pours down from above, bathing you in its warm, cleansing rays. You raise your cupped hands, as if offering up an invisible gift, and a tingling sensation runs the length of your arms and spreads through your body, giving you an incredible sense of well-being. A ball of sparkling light is taking shape in your hands. It condenses into a radiant crystal filled with golden fire: it is the Lorestone of Ohrido.</p>

<p>Day breaks and the view it brings fills you with awe. Perched on this rocky peak, you can see the sheer vastness of the swamp in all its frightening glory for the first time. Paido activates the starguider and scans the horizon, but even before its tell-tale clicks are heard, your eagle eyes have spotted the glint of the temple’s korlinium spire. To the west, beyond a sea of sickly green-black vegetation, stands the Temple of Ohrido, imprisoned but unaffected by the swamp.</p>
<p>The howl of the Ghagrim echoes across the island as you make your descent, by rope and vine, to the wetlands below. You reach the rocky base and set off across the mud flats, following the starguider’s signal now that the spire is hidden by swamp mist.</p>

<p>A bead of sweat on Paido’s forehead is the first sign of his recovery. Slowly he stirs to consciousness, waking from a sleep that was so nearly his last. He can remember nothing of the ordeal, and when you tell him what has happened he shakes his head in disbelief. ‘A Helghast?’ he says, incredulously. ‘How can it be?’</p>
<p>‘The servants of Darklord Gnaag have infiltrated this monastery,’ you reply. ‘They have kept themselves hidden, but I fear the day is fast approaching when they will rise up and wreak their havoc. Already they know our true identities, and I wager they know why we’re here.’</p>
<p>‘This is bitter news, Lone Wolf,’ replies Paido, his face etched with worry. ‘We can afford to delay no longer. If Talestria falls to Darklord Gnaag before we reach the Danarg, then the quest is lost.’ You nod in agreement, and as you cast your eyes along the gloomy passageway, you cannot help but wonder if the quest is already lost. With a shake of your head you dismiss the thought and help Paido to his feet.</p>
<p>The passage follows a tortuous path that leads eventually to a panelled door. A raised button activates the lock, and the door slides into the wall to reveal a strange room. Domed and hexagonal, its walls are hung with tapestries depicting strange and grotesque creatures. Numerous plinths stand upon the richly carpeted floor, each supporting a large bowl filled to the brim with a silvery liquid. Cautiously you step through the secret portal and into this sumptuous chamber.</p>

Strong hands lift you off the floor and steer you towards a quiet corner of the tap-room where Paido sits, grinning broadly. ‘That Bor Brew packs a vicious punch,’ he says, blithely, barely able to conceal his amusement at the effect the ale has had on you.</p>
<p>‘It’s got a taste like nectar but the kick of an angry mule!’ replies the man in red, who has helped you across the floor. As your vision and the pain in your head begin to clear, you notice that he is a soldier. He wears the scarlet tunic of the Tharro garrison, emblazoned with their insignia of a castle and an open hand. You apologize for the trouble you have caused and offer to buy him a drink to make amends. He accepts but on one condition—that you do not have another Bor Brew!</p>

Sheep and cattle graze by the roadside, and the air is rich with the scents of the farmyard, flowers, and damp grass.</p>

<p>By noon you have put thirty miles behind you but still have thirty more to ride before you reach the town of Tharro. Steadily the sky is darkening, and what began as fine drizzle has now developed into sheets of heavy rain. Both of you are drenched, and your horses are beginning to steam as they splash through the ankle-deep puddles that punctuate the muddy highway.</p>

Grief fills your senses and you mourn the loss of your brave companion, but your grief soon turns to anger as you remember the foul trickery that ended his life and so nearly put an end to yours.</p>
<p>A rage grows within you. You take Paido’s sword and vow to avenge his death by washing it in the blood of his murderers. Heedless of caution and the warning cry of your senses, you throw open the cellar door and go in search of vengeance.</p>
<p>You have taken only a few paces along the corridor when a terrific explosion lifts you off your feet. The monks followed your trail to the cellar and prepared a surprise for you. You have tripped a wire and activated an explosive charge set into the floor. When the monks come to inspect their handiwork, they will discover your remains lying in the rubble.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>

<p>The sudden thud of metal on wood makes you spin round on your heel. Nestling between two kegs of ale on the tavern counter you glimpse the face of the innkeeper, the stock of a heavy crossbow pressed close to his bearded cheek. He growls a curse and tightens his finger around the trigger.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards along this jetty of volcanic rock, you encounter a cloud of choking marsh gas. A pair of green, spindly-limbed creatures sits on the causeway, dangling their legs over the side and sniffing the stinking cloud with apparent delight.

The mood soon becomes much friendlier and you learn that the soldier, whose name is Trost, is on his way back to his post at the Tharro garrison after enjoying a week’s leave with his family in Phoena.</p>
<p>As you drink your ale, the sound of applause rises above the hubbub of conversation. An elderly man, tall and distinguished-looking, walks slowly to the centre of the floor and bows to his audience. His pale face and silver-grey hair are a stark contrast to his richly embroidered robes of crimson and gold. He smiles warmly and introduces himself as Count Conundrum, the prince of puzzles. For your amusement, he will pose some brain-twisting conundrums. So confident is he that none will be able to answer his riddles correctly that he is offering 20 Lune to anyone who can prove him wrong. A hush descends as the passengers await his first puzzle.</p>

<p>The refectory door slams shut, and you hear the sound of a metal bar being drawn. There is a hiss of steel against leather as Paido unsheathes his sword. He levels the blue blade at the sinister monk and narrows his cat-like eyes. ‘What do you want with us?’ he says, his voice sharp and threatening. But the monk offers no reply. He stands motionless, his eyes fixed firmly on you. Paido repeats his demand, but his voice sounds weaker. The sword trembles in his hand and, with a groan, he collapses, scattering plates and cutlery as he hits the table and rolls to the floor.</p>

After staring at it for a few moments, you realize with disbelief that the ill-smelling mound before you is alive.

<p>Once more the Count repeats his conundrum. He allows his audience to ponder on it for a few more minutes, but still no answer is offered. Finally he pockets the silver box and declares his puzzling at an end. At first the crowd groan in disappointment, but they are quick to show their appreciation by applauding loudly when the Count leaves the hold. ‘Honey Lodge!’ shouts the bargee. ‘Five minutes to Honey Lodge.’ A group of farmers gather up their belongings, say farewell to their travelling companions and begin to climb the tap-room stairs as the barge slows to a halt.</p>

<p>The sword strikes you squarely between the shoulder blades, sending you tumbling from the saddle. You fall awkwardly, driving the blade deeper into your back.

<p>The sun is setting as you catch your first glimpse of Tharro on the road ahead. Mud-coloured walls, tall and fortified, surround the houses which sit atop a broad grassy rise known as Fortress Hill. Soldiers in tunics of scarlet and grey patrol the walls and stand guard at the huge wooden doors that grant access to the town’s south quarter.</p>
<p>You ride along the straight dirt road towards a stone bridge, which arches across a man-made canal encircling the hill. Once over the bridge, you pass up a ramp leading to the gatehouse. At the gate, a square-jawed soldier in silver chainmail demands to know your business before he will allow you entry to the town.</p>

<p>You follow the stream until it enters a long corridor of towering trees that descend towards the bank of a swift-flowing brook, a tributary of the River Syad. You stop here briefly to bathe your faces in the icy water and to stare at the mass of blue-green giant trees that fill the western horizon.</p>
<p>‘The Mordril Forest,’ says Paido, a note of trepidation in his voice. ‘It was once a wondrous forest, a place of light and goodness. The trees grew strong and the birds and beasts were the fairest of any forest breed. But the Mordril has grown dark and dismal of late. The Danarg encroaches, feeding its sickness to the soil and poisoning the saplings and the creatures that dwell there still. It is a doomed forest, doomed to become part of the Danarg swamp.’</p>
<p>You remount your horse and cross the brook. As you climb the opposite bank you notice a set of freshly made tracks in the soft earth.</p>

<p>The man spins around in shocked alarm at the sound of your voice. An instant later Paido appears at his back and hits him at the base of the skull with the edge of his open hand. The man grunts and drops heavily to his knees before keeling over the edge of the platform. With a dull splash, he lands face down atop a mound of manure and rotting vegetation.</p>

<p>Your sense of time slips away as you trek through the seemingly endless expanse of bleak grey trees. Slowly you become aware that you are on an incline, and as your passage becomes steeper, you notice large outcrops of pitted volcanic rock.</p>
<p>‘We’re approaching the Danarg crater,’ says Paido, his quietly spoken words echoing loudly through the eerie forest. Suddenly you recall the words of Lord Rimoah during your period of preparation in Elzian: ‘The Danarg occupies the crater of an ancient and massive volcano. Once it was a lush jungle of fertile vegetation, but now it is a cancerous wound that poisons all who dwell there…’</p>
<p>By noon you have climbed to the lip of the crater and begun your descent. Gradually the tall, straight trees of the Mordril Forest thin out giving way to twisted trunks and stunted saplings as the land sinks deeper and deeper. Imperceptibly the forest ends and the swamp begins. The ground is softer, and tall, black rushes appear in clumps around misty pools of stagnant water. From tortured husks of trees hang thorny vines, as tough and as cruel as sharpened steel wire. So thickly are they entwined around some trees that they have strangled them, leaving empty coils where the trunks have rotted away. The stench of decay fills your nostrils in the humid yet cold air.</p>
<p>You wade through ankle-deep slime for nearly an hour before reaching the edge of a huge, murky pool. Whirls and eddies disturb its surface, warning of the creatures that lurk below.</p>

<p>‘This should cover it,’ you say, sliding the gold coins across the bar. He tests them between his teeth before nodding his approval.</p>
<p>‘No offence t’you two gentlemen, y’understand, but I’ve been caught with snide coinage afore an’ it’s made me a might careful like. These be Dessi mint, if I’m not mistaken?’ he enquires, his eye twinkling at the thought of hearing tales of that distant magical land.</p>
<p>‘Could be,’ says Paido, guardedly. ‘The coins of Magnamund mix freely in Garthen’s markets—there’s no telling when those four last saw their birthplace.’</p>
<p>‘How about you, innkeeper?’ you interrupt, steering conversation away from Dessi. ‘You’re no native Talestrian. When did you last see your homeland?’ The dwarf’s face beams as he prepares to talk on his favourite subject—himself. By the time you have finished your food and ale you have heard the life story of Lardin, son of Kardon of Bor.</p>

<p>‘News of a kind that’s becomin’ only too familiar round these parts,’ he replies in a disgruntled tone. ‘But that Zegron’s bitten off more than he can chew this time. Once Lord Adamas an’ the army boys come down on ’im he’ll wish he’d stayed in his stinkin’ city o’ Xanar, mark my words.’</p>
<p>‘Don’t be too sure o’ that, Lardin,’ says a rosy-faced farmer, who has sidled along the bar to within earshot of your conversation. ‘My sister reckons that this time Zegron won’t stop till he’s flattened everything between Luukos and the Tentarias.’</p>
<p>‘That star-gazin’ sister o’ yours is full o’ good news,’ retorts the dwarf. ‘When ’as she ever seen anything cheerful with ’er telescopes an’ charts an’ crystal balls, eh? Answer me that!’ Agreement rumbles from the tavern crowd, now openly listening to the discussion.</p>

She is dressed in a green suede-cloth tunic, similar to your own, and wears soft, calf-skin gloves. In addition to the maps, which she researches and draws herself, she also sells all manner of hunting and scouting equipment. She takes an obvious delight in her work and shows you samples of her maps, which are excellent for their accuracy and attention to detail. You ask her if she has ever prepared a map of the Danarg and she turns strangely silent. Tears begin to fill her dark eyes as she recalls how she and her father once explored beyond the fringes of that fearsome domain. They had planned to map its internal waterways and, if luck was with them, discover the lost temple of the Elder Magi. With sadness she tells of her father’s death in the jaws of a monster that had stalked them from the moment they had entered the jungle-swamp. She escaped but not unscathed. As she fought to free her father from the mouth of the beast she was badly burned by its caustic saliva. Carefully she removes one of her calf-skin gloves and reveals an injured hand.

<p>At the top of the stairs you pass through a curtained archway and step into a large prayer hall. A central aisle separates the pews of white wood, which face a golden pulpit with a facia shaped to resemble a flaming sword. Carefully you rest Paido on a pew and examine the glass vial you found in the kitchen. Your fears and suspicions are soon confirmed—it contains poison. The clear, sticky fluid is sap from the gnadurn tree, a substance used frequently by assassins because of its lack of flavour or scent. The monks must have put some of this poison in the food that Paido unwittingly consumed. The sap is deadly, and you must act quickly if you are to save your companion’s life.</p>
<p>You hear the sound of running feet and the growl of dogs off the leash at the bottom of the stairs. Once more you shoulder your burden, carrying Paido towards the far end of the hall in search of an exit. Behind a drawn curtain you discover a door, but it is locked and bolted from the other side. The noise of your pursuers grows louder as they climb the stairs to the hall.</p>

<p>As you fight, the Vordak succeeds in driving its black steel sword through the side of the ship’s pressure tank. A blast of liquid gas hisses from the hole, freezing the Vordak in its petrifying spray. From above comes a stream of blue fire that ignites the escaping gas. There is a flash, and in a fraction of a second, the Levitron is transformed into a colossal ball of flame.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wave of heat awakens your senses. Paido has summoned fire to his aid, wafting a sheet of flame down upon the spiders that are closing in for the kill. They flare brightly, their legs withering in the flames, their crackling black bodies dropping to the floor and crumbling to dust. Kezoor shrieks in frustration. He draws his sword before his face and mouths a silent spell of protection before lowering his blade and pointing it towards your chest.</p>

<p>You leave the pool and press on along the muddy trail, glancing back once. No sign remains of the dead Xlorg; their bodies have already been claimed by the creatures of the pool.</p>

<p>The dwarf stops hammering. ‘Is that you, Filcher?’ he asks, squinting along the tunnel. When he realizes you are not Filcher, he curses and hurls his mattock at your head. You duck aside, but the pick-like weapon spins past and catches Paido full in the chest. He screams and falls, dying, at your feet. Desperately you try to save him, but the wound is fatal. Anger wells up inside, and you turn to confront his killer, only to find yourself staring into the muzzle of a Bor musket. The dwarf pulls the trigger, and you are decapitated by the blast.</p>
<p>It may be some consolation to learn that your killer did not escape unpunished. The shock wave of the blast brought down the tunnel ceiling and buried him alive.</p>

<p>‘By the stars!’ he hisses. ‘It’s him…it’s Kezoor the Necromancer!’ He pulls a crumpled scroll from within his tunic and unfurls it on the table. On it is a picture of a man’s face—the cruel features bear an uncanny resemblance to those of the stranger. Beneath the picture you read:</p>

<p>When Paido finally climbs down from the tree, his face betrays his anxiety. ‘What is wrong?’ you ask impatiently.</p>
<p>‘There is no signal,’ he replies. ‘I have scanned every direction with the starguider, but it can detect no korlinium signal. It isn’t damaged, of that I’m sure. It’s simply as if the temple has disappeared.’</p>
<p>You take the device from Paido’s hand and climb the twisted tree trunk. He shouts instructions and you set the starguider into operation, scanning the distant horizon and waiting for the tell-tale <i>click</i> that will reveal the direction of the lost temple of the Elder Magi. But Paido is right—there is no signal; and without a signal there is no hope of finding the Lorestone of Ohrido.</p>
<p>You are about to abandon the search and jump down from the tree when you see something on the northern horizon that you hadn’t noticed before. An island of red volcanic rock rises out of the mire, one of four flat-topped islands grouped in a diamond close to the eastern edge of the crater. Perhaps the temple is on the other side of that island. Perhaps that is why the starguider will emit no signal?</p>
<p>You climb down and ask Paido what he thinks. He stares to the north and ponders the problem. ‘Yes, it is possible,’ he says thoughtfully, ‘it is just possible.’</p>

It is sensitive to the vibrations of korlinium crystals.

<p>The Helghast vents a cry of rage and despair as you strike the blow that seals its doom. It crumples and falls, its flesh transforming into a vile green gas. All that remains is the torn and shredded robe that once concealed its identity.</p>
<p>Your mind reels at what has just occurred, but you dare not dwell on the fearful implications, for you can make out the sound of feet running down the stairs beyond the locked refectory door. You rush to Paido’s side and shake him, trying desperately to revive him. He groans, his head lolling from side to side as you drag him to his feet. There is now only one escape route from the refectory—the hatch in the wall that leads to the kitchens. You lift Paido across your shoulder and bundle him through the narrow opening. But, before you can pull yourself through, the door slams open and a rush of monks pour into the refectory.</p>

From the tip of his sword a sheet of flame wafts down upon the spiders now closing in for the kill. They flare brightly, their legs withering in the flames, their crackling black bodies dropping to the floor and crumbling away to dust. ‘Attack!’ shouts Paido, and together you advance against your foe.

<p>One of the bowls begins to emit a faint humming sound. The surface of its silvery liquid swirls and glows brighter, casting a phosphorescent light onto the domed ceiling. The sparkling mist slowly clears and a strange image takes shape, condensing and forming into something wholly alien, something that resembles the head of a monstrous fly. Its great multi-faceted eyes stare down at you, gleaming darkly with black fire, like two huge clusters of evil jewels.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration IX]</div>
<p>‘<i xml:lang="x-giak">Tan-ash-okja Nadoknar Gnaag!</i>’ booms a ghastly, rasping voice. Then, with a stifled cry of rage and recognition, the image clouds over and the light fades to a dull glow. The terrible visage of Darklord Gnaag has disappeared.</p>
<p>‘By the gods!’ gasps Paido, shocked to the core by what he has seen. ‘What manner of beast was that?’ But you do not reply, for you sense that he already knows the dreadful answer.</p>
<p>Swiftly you search the chamber. Behind a throne-like chair of chiselled stone you discover several useful items: a Sword, a Bow, 3 Arrows and enough food for 2 Meals. Also, set into the back of the chair, is a lever. It activates a portal in the opposite wall. The tapestry that conceals it is drawn aside, and you can see a stairway, flanked by torches, descending to a passage far below.</p>
<p>‘Come,’ says Paido. ‘This room chills my blood.’ You move to follow him as he descends the stairs, stopping briefly to kick over the bowl of glowing, silvery liquid that projected the image of Darklord Gnaag.</p>

<p>Your ears are filled with a loathsome hissing as the bodies of your slain enemies dissolve into the mud. You stare at their smouldering remains, and a cold chill grips your heart as you speculate on why these foul servants of the Darklords came to this sleepy Talestrian hamlet.</p>
<p>Inside the abbey you discover the grisly answer. Scattered throughout the chambers and corridors are the bodies of dead monks, their lifeless faces frozen in masks of horror. Several have been stripped of their robes, presumably to provide a disguise for their killers.</p>
<p>‘Why would the Darklords want to take control of this abbey?’ asks Paido, horrified at the sight of such slaughter.</p>
<p>‘I fear it is part of their plan to conquer Talestria,’ you reply. ‘It is always their strategy to infiltrate a land with agents before invading. When invasion is launched, these agents rise up and attack from within.’</p>
<p>‘So you think that the Darklords plan to invade Talestria,’ says Paido, aghast at the possibility of such an event.</p>
<p>‘I suspect that their plan is already under way,’ you say thoughtfully. ‘Perhaps the destruction of Luukos was masterminded not in Xanar, but in Helgedad.’</p>
<p>Paido helps you to bury the monks in the graves already dug by their killers. As you cover the last of the bodies with soil you notice a small, pear-shaped stone lying on the pathway. Its speckled blue surface is mirror-smooth and, despite its size, it feels remarkably heavy. You suspect it is very valuable and decide to keep it.

At first glance it looks as if two totally separate creatures have been joined together at the waist: the lower half is covered with a coarse, spiky fur, and the upper body is pale and hairless, heavily veined, with long sinewy forearms.

Immediately he spits it out, wiping away its insipid taste on the back of his hand. ‘Bilge juice!’ he splutters, slamming down his mug.</p>
<p>‘You should be a sight more careful where you empty your mouth, stranger,’ growls a man to your right. He bends down and picks up his polished steel helmet.

<p>It is late afternoon when you see the Temple of Ohrido, rising majestically out of the swamp mists and tangled vegetation. The sight of this towering ziggurat is so breathtaking that you are both stunned into silence as you feast your eyes on its untarnished splendour. Tier upon tier of gleaming white stone, shaped and formed into perfect symmetry, confront you. Huge foundation slabs support a level carved of golden rock, inlaid and decorated with gemstones. Above that sit strata of precious metals and then levels made up of crystal slabs, whose facets refract the colours of the rainbow. Upward climb tiers of ruby, sapphire, and emerald, that offer up a wedge-shaped spire of pure korlinium crystal to the sky.</p>
<p>At its base the swamp has shrunk back as if repelled by the radiant goodness of the temple. A perimeter of lush grass leads to a staircase of solid amber. You follow Paido as he ascends towards a pair of huge triangular doors set into the second level. Everywhere the glitter of gemstones and the gleam of precious metals radiate a purity unspoiled by the Danarg. Paido completes the complex procedures that open the great doors, taught to him by the Elder Magi in preparation for this mission.

An eerie, unnatural silence accompanies your ride, broken only by the rare cawing of ravens, circling high overhead.</p>
<p>By midday you are deep among the hills. The terrain becomes increasingly rocky, undulating like a storm-tossed ocean.

<p>You hang your dripping Kai cloak over the back of an empty chair and draw it close to the blazing log fire. Your entrance has drawn curious glances from the tavern crowd and you can hear them speculating, in hushed voices, on the purpose of your visit. Paido removes his Backpack and hooded cape before joining you at a table. The whisperings increase as the plains folk catch sight of his dark skin and plaited, flaxen hair.</p>
<p>‘Pay no attention to them,’ advises the dwarf. ‘They’re a might suspicious folk an’ news of late’s done nought to better their nature.’ You nod benignly and assure the dwarf that they have nothing to fear from two travel-weary adventurers on their way north in search of work. Paido reaches for his pack and removes half a loaf of black bread and a slab of salted pork. He is about to offer you a share when a loud voice, full of indignation, rings in your ear. ‘And what do you think you’re up to?’</p>
<p>It is the voice of the cheerful dwarf, although the sight of you preparing to eat your own food in his tavern has greatly soured his mood. He strides across the floor and scatters Paido’s food with the back of his hand. ‘Get out!’ he bellows, his face growing redder by the second. ‘Get out before I throw you out!’</p>

<p>‘And to what do we owe the honour of your visit to Tharro?’ asks Trost the soldier, in a polite but inquisitive tone.</p>
<p>‘It’s on the way to Syada,’ replies Paido. ‘We’re going there in search of some work. We heard about the attack on Luukos, and we reckon there’ll be a few rich farmers there who’ll pay handsomely for us to protect their interests.’</p>
<p>Trost chuckles and rubs his stubbly chin. ‘I mean no offence, but if Zegron and his rabble attack the farms near Syada it’ll take more than two free-lances to turn their tails. If I were you I’d stay in Tharro—there’s plenty of work there for the likes of you. Take my advice and leave Zegron to the army. We’ll blunt his nose, don’t you worry.’</p>
<p>A shudder runs through the floor as the barge gets underway. A new passenger has boarded at Honey Lodge, a thin individual with hard grey eyes. He descends the tap-room stairs, pausing to shake rain from his cloak and wide-brimmed hat. Slung at his side is a narrow-bladed sword and clutched in his hand is a leather-bound book, its cover as plain and as black as his sombre clothing. Without saying a word he takes a seat in the shadows of the opposite corner and opens his book to read.</p>

Cramp grips your chest like an iron vice, preventing you from breathing and, in the course of three short minutes, you slip into unconsciousness, and from there into a sleep from which there is no awakening.</p>

<p>The light fades and you step down from the dais, your senses aglow with a newfound wisdom and strength. Having witnessed the fulfilment of your quest, Paido beams with joy as you return to his side. He congratulates you and bids you follow as he turns towards an archway of silver set into the crystal walls of the chamber. ‘Come, Lone Wolf. We have a long journey ahead of us. We must leave without delay.’</p>
<p>The thought of returning to the dangers of the Danarg fills you with dread. Paido senses your anxiety. ‘Don’t look so dismayed,’ he says, still smiling. ‘This temple will provide the means for our safe return, you will see.’ Intrigued by his answer, you follow in silence as he leads you through the archway and up a long flight of marble stairs to another chamber, also constructed of crystal but veined with a marble that glistens like liquid fire. It is solid korlinium. At the centre of the chamber, its hull resting on a cradle of steel, is a Levitron—an ancient skyship. Like everything else that you have seen in this wondrous temple, the craft is untarnished by time. Paido ushers you aboard and prepares to power the craft. A shudder runs through the hull as the engines rise in pitch and slowly it lifts from its bed of steel. The chamber is built in the spire of the temple and the roof now slides open to allow the Levitron to rise into the darkening sky above the Danarg.</p>
<p>Paido sets the controls and sets the ship’s starguider on a course for Elzian. Then he joins you at the bow-rail for one last look at the Temple of Ohrido. It glows red in the light of the setting sun, but the shimmering glow is blemished by shadows that swoop back and forth across its tiers. You assume it is just a trick of the twilight, until your ears are filled by a sudden and terrifying shriek.</p>

<p>The man’s voice, gruff and gravelly, demands that Paido state good reason for the intrusion or suffer the consequences of trespassing on private land. Paido answers with a sound far louder than you ever imagined could be made by a human voice. The force of the shout hits the man in the chest like a clenched fist, slamming him backwards through the timber parapet rail of the platform. He lands with a dull splash, spread-eagled atop a mound of manure and rotting vegetation.</p>

He wears a knee-length surcoat of scarlet cloth over a suit of heavy chainmail, and upon his chest is emblazoned a crest depicting a castle and an open hand. Paido hesitates, not from fear of his opponent, but because he has suddenly recognized the uniform of a soldier of the Tharro garrison.</p>

<p>The heavy rain and the burial have delayed the journey. The bargees try to make up lost time by whipping the ghorkas, but to no avail. The muddy towpath and their waterlogged fur prevent them from pulling any faster. It is mid-afternoon by the time the barge arrives at the next stopping place—Ferry House. A ramshackle building is perched precariously on the edge of the river bank, and an old wooden jetty juts out from the side, its empty platform almost submerged by the swollen river.

You collect your horses and disembark with the other mounted passengers, riding in line towards the fortified town gate.

<p>Paido screams for your help. A swooping Kraan-rider has cast a large net, smothering his body. The net is sewn with hundreds of tiny barbed hooks which have worked their way into his skin and clothes, and he cannot free himself without the hooks inflicting fearful wounds. Only one Vordak remains to confront him, all the others having perished on his blade, but he is now unable to defend himself against this creature. He is at the mercy of a merciless foe.</p>
<p>You scramble to your feet and rush to save him as the Vordak creeps closer. Suddenly the Kraan-rider reappears, gliding low across the deck before hovering over the bow. A length of thin black rope dangles from its saddle and hurriedly the Vordak threads it through the corners of the net. You race up the steps, shouting ‘For Sommerlund’ and launch your attack. The Vordak turns to face you, its skeletal features frozen in a mask of terror. An instant later your weapon shears its bony neck and sends its skull-like head spinning down into the Danarg. A ghastly cry pierces your ears, but it is not a shriek of pain or despair: it is a malicious caw of triumph. The Kraan beats its massive wings, and the down-draught forces you to your knees as the creature climbs higher into the darkening sky. You stare aghast as the rope closes the net around Paido and lifts him off the deck. Instinctively you leap upwards, your hands outstretched to grab the barbed net, but it is too late. The Kraan turns in mid-air and flies off to the north with Paido, wounded and helpless, swinging like a netted fish below its leathery black belly.</p>

<p>You and Paido bid farewell to Lord Adamas and spur your horses along the wide paved street towards the city’s gatehouse. The wagon-worn highway leads to the village of Sharr, a small, wood-walled enclave of fishermen and bargees, built around a great stone bridge which spans the River Phoen. You leave the highway and follow a twisting path down to the river’s edge. There a barge is ready to leave for Tharro; its team of ghorkas are harnessed and the crew are preparing to cast off the thick rope hawsers securing the barge to the quay.</p>
<p>The captain sees you approach and calls to his men, ‘Hold fast, lads! Looks like we’ve two more for Tharro.’</p>
<p>A gangplank is lowered and the crew guide your horses aboard. As you dismount the captain strides along the bleached wood deck and greets you like an old friend, shaking both of you warmly by the hand. ‘Lord Adamas sent word to expect two riders for this trip, though I’d almost given up waiting for you to show. He’s paid your fares and he said you may be wantin’ some privacy, so I’ve set aside a cabin at the stern. My lads will see to your horses.’</p>
<p>The captain points to the rear of the barge where two sets of stairs descend below the deck. ‘Take the stairs on your left; your cabin is the door at the end of the gangway. If you be wantin’ some food or ale, there’s a tap-room in the hold—just take the stairs on the right.’</p>

<p>All at once, as if in response to a silent signal, the monks throw back their hoods to reveal ghastly, fleshless faces. ‘By the gods!’ gasps Paido. They emit a hideous shriek, panicking the horses. As you fight to control your frightened animal, the skeletal monks spring forward to attack.</p>

A splash of hissing sparks lights the room as your weapon scrapes along the jet-black pole and glances off its twisted tip. You raise your arm to strike again, but you are distracted by Paido’s scream of alarm. His face is deathly pale and his hands and arms are trembling uncontrollably. With a groan he collapses, scattering plates and cutlery as he hits the table and rolls unconscious to the floor.</p>

<p>You give the pool a wide berth before finding your way back to where the starguider’s signal is strongest. A creeping bank of mist rolls across your path and the maker of the web looms out of it.

The leading monks throw up their hands in horror and fall against those behind as the dogs leap on them, biting and clawing at their throats. This unexpected attack throws the monks into a panic.

<p>It is late afternoon when you ride into Stia, a village comprising a score of cottages and a dilapidated hut which sits astride the Great North Road. As you approach the tiny thatched hut its stable door swings open and an old man steps out of the shadows. He is wearing an odd assortment of antique armour and regalia that clanks and rattles like a cart-load of rusty metal as he shuffles across your path.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XV]</div>
<p>‘Hold there, strangers!’ he blusters, his croaky voice full of self-importance. ‘Proceed no further till you pay the toll.’ You draw your horse to a halt and stare down at the ridiculous-looking figure.</p>
<p>‘By what authority do you levy a toll on the Queen’s highway?’ asks Paido, irritated by the delay. ‘By the authority of the Queen herself,’ retorts the old man, indignantly, pointing with crooked finger to a placard on the wall of his hut. It bears the faded seal of Queen Evaine, but the board is so weathered that the words above it are illegible.</p>
<p>‘We travel to Tharro on royal business,’ you say, showing the Pass given to you by Lord Adamas. ‘Stand aside and let us proceed.’ The old man snatches the Pass from your hand and scrutinizes it, though it is obvious that his eyesight is so poor that he cannot read the contents.</p>
<p>‘Bah!’ he snorts, thrusting the Pass back into your hand. ‘It’s a forgery! You’ll not fool me with that worthless scrap o’ vellum!’</p>
<p>‘And we’ll not be taken in by a greedy old fool whose wits are as rusty as the armour he wears!’ shouts Paido angrily. As his words echo along the street a dozen villagers, armed with an assortment of farming tools, come to investigate the commotion. They form up in a line behind the old man, ready to enforce his demand.</p>
<p>‘What is the toll?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘Only a trinket you may have that takes our fancy; that is all. One item apiece and you can continue on your way,’ replies the old man, smugly. ‘But let it not be said that we are without wit,’ he snaps, glaring at Paido. ‘We Stians pride ourselves on our sense of fair play and our love of riddles, therefore I shall make you an offer that satisfies us both. Answer me one riddle correctly and you can pass through our village without paying the toll. Answer wrongly, or give no answer at all, and you must pay the toll without question. Is it agreed?’</p>

A fat merchant stands in the doorway, waiting impatiently for customers despite the late hour. ‘Good evening, gentlemen,’ he says, in a thin and wheedling voice. ‘Welcome to the emporium of Rath Radis, the storehouse of miracles.’ Through the open doorway you can see that the shop is brim-full of curious magical paraphernalia.</p>

<p>The flicker of an eyelid and a bead of sweat are the first signs of Paido’s recovery. Slowly he stirs to consciousness, waking from a sleep that was so nearly his last. He can remember nothing of the ordeal and, when you tell him all that has happened, he shakes his head in disbelief. ‘A Helghast?’ he says, incredulous. ‘How can it be?’</p>
<p>‘The servants of Darklord Gnaag have infiltrated this monastery,’ you reply. ‘They have kept themselves hidden, but I fear the day is fast approaching when they will rise up and wreak havoc in this town. Already they know our true identities, and I wager they know why we’re here.’</p>

<p>For the most part the swamp mire is firm underfoot and the inhabitants pose no problems that cannot be solved by a few shouts or well-placed weapon blows.

<p>You empty the tankard in one go and wipe the froth from your lips. Seconds later the floor of the hold begins to rock from side to side, gently at first, but gathering momentum until you are forced to cling to the table to prevent yourself from falling over. The other passengers seem unaffected by the violent pitching and rolling, as if their feet were nailed to the deck. You shout a warning that the barge is about to sink, that they should try to save themselves before it is too late. They cackle and sneer at your concern for their safety, their faces growing larger and more grotesque and the sound of their laughter building to a deafening crescendo. A man in a red coat looms before you, his face twisted and deformed. He grabs your shoulders and you feel his fingers sink painlessly into your flesh. Recoiling in horror, you draw a hand weapon to defend yourself from this frightening apparition. As you step forward to strike a blow, a wave of giddiness robs you of all balance and you crash headlong to the floor.</p>

<p>The whistle of your Arrow can be heard above the rumbling hoofbeats of the approaching cavalry. It flies straight and true, tearing through the chainmail links that protect the leader’s throat. The sudden pain makes him snatch at his reins, and his horse falters, stumbles, and then falls. The wounded leader is flung forward over the horse’s head, and he crashes into the ground with a sickening crunch. With their leader slain, the morale of the other men is badly shaken. They break off their ambush, wheeling their horses about and galloping away in disorder.</p>
<p>‘Let us fly,’ shouts Paido, ‘before they regroup and strike again.’ You shoulder your Bow and follow Paido as he leaves the track and rides along the stream to the west.</p>

You strike from behind, breaking the back of one with your downstroke and opening the side of another as you swing your weapon clear.</p>
<p>Paido falls, clutching an arm deeply torn by needle-sharp talons. His attacker turns on you, darting its head towards your throat with lightning speed. Its jaws gape wide as it lashes out with a sticky tongue, spraying your eyes with stinging saliva. Instinctively you bend forward, your hands wiping the spittle from your face, a reflex action which saves you from the creature’s grip as it leaps forward to strangle you. Suddenly it lets out a gurgling croak and falls forward with a thick splash. You stagger back and open your bloodshot eyes to see it lying face down in the mire with Paido’s dagger embedded in its back. ‘Look out!’ screams your companion, as the last of the Xlorg attacks you from behind.</p>

<p>The display is fascinating but your attention is drawn to one item in particular—a ring of translucent grey crystal.

He smiles ruefully and, after pausing to get his breath back, he invites you to come and see what he has found in the back room. Small sacks, each filled with nuggets of silver, are stacked in a huge mound that reaches almost to the ceiling.</p>

<p>A smile crumples her face and a blush, like an angry bruise, discolours her leathery cheeks. ‘I am her mother,’ she says coyly. ‘What is it you wish to see her about?’</p>
<p>Before you can answer, a young woman’s voice calls from inside the house, ‘Show them in, mother. I’ve been expecting them.’</p>
<p>The old woman leads you and Paido to a room at the top of the stairs. Books and charts, stacked high on shelves and scattered about the floor, fill the room which is illuminated by daylight streaming through a domed portal in the ceiling. A massive bronze telescope is fixed to the portal and below it rests a circular table of carved bone set with gems. Seated at the table is a beautiful young woman. Her hair is silken gold, and around her high, pale forehead she wears a circlet of jet inlaid with runes and mystic symbols.</p>

Paido halts and crouches down, ignoring the bloated spiders that scuttle around his knees, and points through a gap in the trees to a settlement of crudely made huts. Dark shapes move between them, human once, but far from human now. ‘Ghagrim,’ whispers Paido, with fear in his voice. ‘The man-beasts of the Danarg.’</p>
<p>In the distant past the Ghagrim were a gentle, primitive folk, who lived as one with the animals and the birds, cared for by the Elder Magi in their jungle paradise. But the Danarg has changed and so too have the Ghagrim, poisoned by the evil that conquered the land.</p>

<p>The slimy stench of the creature drives your horse wild with fear, forcing you to dismount and advance along the tree-bridge to meet it. Suddenly there is a fearful cry as your panic-stricken horse careers backwards into Paido’s mount. He fights to keep control of his own frightened horse but the panic is infectious and, with a crack of splintering wood, their stamping hooves split the edge of the tree-bridge. You watch with horror as both horses fall headlong into the watery abyss. Paido leaps from his mount as it falls, grabbing hold of the edge of the splintered wood, but it is wet and you can see his fingers slipping.

<p>The door is unlocked. You flick the latch with the toe of your boot and enter a gloomy passage that descends to a cellar. Casks of ale and dusty bottles of vintage wine fill the cubby-holed walls as far as your eye can see. Thick, vaulted columns support the ceiling, and the air is sweet with the smell of burning tallow.</p>
<p>You kneel and rest Paido against the cellar wall while you examine the glass vial you found in the kitchen. Your fears and suspicions are immediately confirmed—it contains poison. The clear, sticky fluid is sap from the gnadurn tree, a substance frequently used by assassins because of its lack of flavour or scent. The monks must have put some of this poison in the stew that Paido unwittingly consumed. The sap is deadly and you must act swiftly if you are to save his life.</p>

<p>You urge your horse up the steep bank and across the fallen branches that litter the trail beyond. Less than a mile from the brook you hear the sound of rushing water. The track bears north and you see a roaring waterfall cascading into a rocky pool, its surface lost in a cloud of fine spray. A huge tree has fallen across the pool, creating a bridge, and the track leads straight to it. You are halfway across the tree-bridge, looking down at the swirling spray and foaming water below, when a ghastly howl rings out above the thunder of the waterfall. You look up and stare slack-jawed at the creature that is advancing towards you across the tree-bridge.</p>

<p>You pull Paido to his feet and help him along the causeway, leaving behind the dead Rahgu and the stinking cloud of gas. The volcanic spur soon comes to an abrupt halt, its jagged edge overhanging a sprawling tangle of reeds, marsh thistles, and black moss. The pools of dark water are few, but the hazards are more than ever before.</p>
<p>‘The brown patches,’ says Paido, his voice hoarse from the effects of the gas, ‘are quicksands.’ He points to where the marsh weeds are sparse and the ground pale and sandy. You stand and count the little tan-coloured patches but give up when you reach fifty.</p>

<p>A Ghagrim lopes towards you, fixing you with a ghastly stare. It slavers and drools through thick grey lips as it licks the blade of its rusty iron sword. With a chilling howl it issues its battle-cry and closes to attack.</p>

<p>The north gate guards, tired after the long night’s watch, grumble wearily at your demand for the gate to be opened. ‘What’s the hurry?’ growls one guardsman.</p>
<p>‘Matter o’ life and death is it?’ sneers the other.</p>
<p>The portcullis finally clanks open and you leave the town, riding the broken dirt track towards the distant hills and the frontier town of Syada. Grey-brown grasses brush your shins as you cross this wild, uncultivated plain. Accompanying your ride is an unnatural silence which is broken only occasionally by the cawing of ravens circling like vultures overhead.</p>
<p>By midday you are among the hills. The terrain becomes increasingly rocky, undulating like a storm-tossed ocean. The tall plains grass has given way to sad little plants, scraggy and deformed, stunted by the winds that sweep down from the barren wastes of Ogia. The track passes through a narrow valley where a small stone cabin stands beside the entrance to a disused mine shaft. As you approach the cabin you see a face at the window.</p>

<p>‘We had best delay no longer, Lone Wolf,’ says Paido, looking anxiously at the afternoon sky. ‘The highway’s no place to be after dark and we’re still a long ride from Tharro.’ You nod your agreement and spur your horse along the track towards the village of Topham.</p>

<p>You take a bottle from the rack, crack it open against the wall, and tip the potion into the remaining wine. Carefully you tilt back Paido’s head and pour the mixture into his open mouth, a drop at a time: in his comatose state he is unable to cough and it would be easy to fill his lungs by accident. It is a slow and painstaking process, which takes you hours to complete.</p>
<p>It is dawn of the following day before you know for sure if you have saved his life.</p>

<h3><a name="sect350">350</a></h3>

<p>Anger and frustration well up inside you as helplessly you watch the Kraan and your captured companion disappear beyond the horizon. Gradually your anger gives way to sadness as you ponder his fate and wonder if he will ever survive this cruel abduction. You pray for his safety, calling on the spirits of your ancestors to watch over and protect him and, as if in answer to your prayer, you feel a sudden calm engulf your senses. The power of the Lorestone, transfused into your being the instant it appeared in your hands, has greatly increased your intellect and awareness. With confidence you know that Paido will survive his ordeal and that one day you will meet and fight again, side by side.</p>
<p>The return voyage to Dessi is a swift but lonely journey. The starguider ensures that the Levitron stays on course for Elzian and as you cross the canal which encircles the city, a pilot skyship arrives to escort you down. During the voyage you have discovered how to control the Levitron, and now, as slowly you approach the landing platform of the Tower of Truth, you disengage the starguider and make a faultless landing. Lord Rimoah and the High Council have gathered to greet your return, and upon hearing of your successful quest their hopes for the future are renewed in spite of the sad news of Lord Paido’s capture by agents of the Darklords.</p>
<p>The High Council listens avidly as you recall your treacherous journey through Talestria, the perilous trek across the Danarg, and the wondrous discovery of their lost temple. When finally you have completed your account they applaud and pay tribute to your courage and daring, their faces beaming with pride. But, despite their joyous greeting, you sense that something is wrong; they seem distant, as if their minds were preoccupied with the solving of a difficult and perplexing problem.</p>
<p>You ask Lord Rimoah if all is well, and he replies: ‘You have grown in perception, Lone Wolf. Many things have occurred since last we spoke, and although your quest for the Lorestone of Ohrido has succeeded, the peril of our age has grown ever more deadly. The Darklords now wage open war throughout Magnamund, and many lands have fallen before their Giak legions. Talestria has been overrun. So too have the Stornland nations. Sommerlund stands firm against the armies of Darklord Gnaag, but she has lost her southern province of Ruanon.’</p>
<p>This shocking news fills you with an urge to return to your homeland, yet to do so would defeat the Magnakai quest.</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah bids you follow him to the chamber of the High Council. Set into the floor is a circular well, brimming with a silvery liquid metal. Rimoah kneels and touches the surface and slowly a vision takes form within the shimmering depths of the pool: it is a fortified city surrounded by rolling hills. ‘You look upon the city of Tahou in the land of Anari,’ says Rimoah, his voice now solemn and composed. ‘The Lorestone you must find next lies deep below its streets, in an ancient city that was built during the dawn of Magnamund.’</p>
<p>The vision of Tahou heralds the start of a new and perilous episode in your quest for the Magnakai. If you possess the bravery and courage of a true Kai Master, the challenge of Tahou awaits you in Book 9 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series entitled:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to any extra points given to you by your Magnakai Disciplines.</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. This number = Combat Ratio.</li>
<li>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio on the top of the chart and cross-reference to the random number you have picked. (E indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Enemy. LW indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Lone Wolf.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from Stage 3 until one character is dead. This is when the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either character falls to 0 or below.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="smevazn">To Evade Combat</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>You may only do this when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>You undertake one round of combat in the usual way. All points lost by the enemy are ignored; only Lone Wolf loses the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>If the book offers the chance of taking evasive action in place of combat, it can be taken in the first round of combat or any subsequent round.</li>

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
<h3><a name="errstat">Note on Adjusted Combat Statistics</a></h3>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document.

<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>

That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>

<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
