<div class="frontmatter">

  <p>You are Lone Wolf—the last Kai Master of Sommerlund. Your search for the mystical Lorestones of your ancestors leads to the grim city-fortress of Torgar, a stronghold of the Darklords.</p>

  <p>In <strong><cite>The Dungeons of Torgar</cite></strong>, your mission is to recapture the last remaining Lorestones from the clutches of your enemy—the evil Darklord Gnaag. But be warned! Every turn of the page presents a new and deadly challenge as you battle through the depths of a fantastic and terrifying fortress in search of your destiny…or your doom!</p>

 
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies—the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power known as the Lorestones of Nyxator, and upon their discovery he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and his experiences in a great tome entitled <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, thereby ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge, you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over a thousand years ago. By doing so successfully, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai, which is held within the Lorestones’ crystal forms.</p>
<p>Already your quest has taken you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master, you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians who aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had awaited your coming. An ancient Dessi legend tells of the birth and rise to greatness of two <i xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</i>, which means ‘sons of the sun’. One was named <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</i>, which means ‘eagle’, and the other was named <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</i>, which means ‘wolf’. A prophecy foretold that the <i xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</i> would each come from the north to seek the counsel of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose, and one destiny—to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril. The Elder Magi knew that you were <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</i>—the wolf of Dessi legend—and in keeping with their ancient vows they promised to help you complete the Magnakai quest.</p>
<p>In Elzian, the capital of Dessi, you were tutored in the histories of Magnamund and received lessons in lore that you would have learned from the Kai masters if only they, like you, had survived the murderous Darklord attack on the Kai Monastery twelve years ago. You were eager to learn all that your tutor, Lord Rimoah, could teach you in preparation for the next stage of your quest, but grim news from the Darklands cut short your tuition. In the Darklord city of Helgedad a civil war had erupted, following your defeat of Haakon, Archlord of the Black City. After five years, the battle for the throne of Helgedad had finally been won by a Darklord called Gnaag. The other Darklords, now united behind this new leader, were ordered to amass huge armies in preparation for the conquest of Magnamund. Swiftly their Giak legions grew in number, enabling Gnaag to launch a sweeping invasion that was to catch the freelands unprepared. Several countries, after brief but futile resistance, were completely overrun by Darkland armies; others surrendered without fighting in the face of their determined might. And sadly there were others who chose to betray former friends and allies by joining the Darklord cause, in the misguided hope that they would share in the spoils of victory, following the triumph of Darklord Gnaag. One such land was Vassagonia, a powerful desert realm to the north of Dessi. Her armies mobilized and invaded the neighbouring states of Casiorn and Cloeasia, and then marched west through the republic of Anari in order to join with Gnaag’s horde as it steamrollered across central Magnamund. The Elder Magi urged you to begin the quest for the fourth Lorestone at once. The enemy armies were converging on the Anarian capital of Tahou, and beneath that ancient city the Lorestone lay hidden.</p>
<p>Aided by Magemaster Banedon, an old friend and fellow countryman, you set off in haste for Tahou and arrived barely hours ahead of the enemy. Successfully you made your descent and discovered the object of your quest, but on returning to the surface you found Tahou transformed into a blazing inferno. Darklord Gnaag and Zakhan Kimah, the ruler of Vassagonia, had learnt of your presence and were determined to destroy you at all costs. For days their engines of war had hurled fire and rock across the walls of Tahou with devastating effect. Then a massive assault, led by the Zakhan himself, breached the west gate and gained entry to the burning city. Armed with a weapon of awesome power, the evil Zakhan sought you out and challenged you to a fight to the death. The struggle was desperate but you emerged victorious and led the Anarians in a counterattack that cleared the city of the invading foe. The allies of Anari arrived to raise the siege and in the ensuing battle the demoralized armies of Gnaag and Kimah were smashed and routed.</p>
<p>Your defeat of Zakhan Kimah turned the tide of war decisively against the Darkland armies and paved the way for the liberation of the lands they had taken by force. But the sweet taste of victory turned sour when you discovered that Darklord Gnaag had captured the last three remaining Lorestones of Nyxator. Lord Rimoah and other members of the High Council of the Elder Magi joined you in Tahou to help formulate a plan of action. They had already received word from Prince Graygor, the ruler of Eru, that one of his patrols had found a man near the borders of the Hellswamp. He was a Talestrian soldier who had escaped from the dread city-fortress of Torgar where he had been imprisoned after being captured in battle. He had suffered terribly at the hands of the Drakkarim—evil humans in the service of the Darklords—and when found he was so badly injured that he was almost unrecognizable. Before he died he spoke of three radiant gems filled with golden light that had been brought to Torgar from the Darklord city of Mozgôar.</p>
<p>‘We are now sure that what he saw was the arrival of the stolen Lorestones,’ said Rimoah, speaking on behalf of the High Council. ‘They radiate a goodness so strong that Gnaag could not hold them in the Darklands but had to move them to Torgar. There his sorcerers—the Nadziranim—are searching for the means to destroy them. The black art of the Nadziranim has grown powerful of late and we fear they may achieve the task set them by Gnaag. Therefore we must act quickly and with utmost secrecy if the Lorestones and the Magnakai quest are to be saved.’</p>
<p>The Elder Magi had already made preparations for your secret journey to Eru where, upon your arrival, Prince Graygor will help you reach the grim city of Torgar. The thought of having to enter the terrible Drakkarim stronghold fills you with dread, but your pledge to destroy the Darklords and restore the Kai strengthens your resolve and helps you suppress your fear.</p>
<p>On the eve of your journey to Eru, the Elder Magi convene a special meeting of the High Council to pray for the success of your mission. For several hours they kneel in prayer until finally they arise and intone the blessing that has sustained you in the past: ‘May the Gods Ishir and Kai protect you on your journey into darkness, <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Kor-Skarn</i>.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to Book 10. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You many choose one bonus <a href="#discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> adventure you successfully complete (Books 6–12).</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Magnakai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
<p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called ‘Lore-circles’. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. (See the section ‘<a href="#lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a>’ for details of these bonuses.)</p>
<p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wpnmstry">Weaponmastery</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 3 to any number that you choose from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Short Sword</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>Quarterstaff</li>
<li>Broadsword</li>
<li>Axe</li>
<li>Sword</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that you are skilled with three Weapons does not mean that you begin the adventure carrying any of them. However, you will have opportunities to acquire Weapons during your adventure. For every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> book that you complete in the Magnakai series, you may add an additional Weapon to your <a href="#action">Weaponmastery Checklist</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponmastery: +3 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, and tick your chosen weapons on the <a href="#action">Weapons List</a>. You cannot carry more than two Weapons.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlctrl">Animal Control</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to communicate with most animals and to determine their purpose and intentions. It also enables a Kai Master to fight from the saddle with great advantage.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Control’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="curing">Curing</a></h4>

<p>The possessor of this skill can restore 1 lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to his total for every numbered section of the book through which he passes, provided he is not involved in combat. (This can only be done after his <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) This Magnakai Discipline also enables a Kai Master to cure disease, blindness, and any combat wounds sustained by others, as well as himself. Using the knowledge that mastery of this skill provides will also allow a Kai Master to identify the properties of any herbs, roots, and potions that may be encountered during the adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Curing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="invsblty">Invisibility</a></h4>

<p>This Magnakai skill allows a Kai Master to blend in with his surroundings, even in the most exposed terrain. It will enable him to mask his body heat and scent, and to adopt the dialect and mannerisms of any town or city that he visits.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Invisibility’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hntmstry">Huntmastery</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Master will never starve in the wild; he will always be able to hunt for food, even in areas of wasteland and desert. It also enables a Kai Master to move with great speed and dexterity and will allow him to ignore any extra loss of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points due to a surprise attack or ambush.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Huntmastery’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="pthmnshp">Pathsmanship</a></h4>

<p>In addition to the basic skill of being able to recognize the correct path in unknown territory, the Magnakai skill of Pathsmanship will enable a Kai Master to read foreign languages, decipher symbols, read footprints and tracks (even if they have been disturbed), and detect the presence of most traps. It also grants him the gift of always knowing intuitively the position of north.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Pathsmanship’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psisurge">Psi-surge</a></h4>

<p>This psychic skill enables a Kai Master to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used as well as normal combat weapons and adds 4 extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. A weaker form of Psi-surge called <cite>Mindblast</cite> can be used against an enemy without losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, but it will add only 2 extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. (Psi-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.) Psi-surge cannot be used if your <small>ENDURANCE</small> falls to 6 points or below, and not all of the creatures encountered on your adventure will be affected by it; you will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Psi-surge: +4 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points but −2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points per round’ and ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="psiscrn">Psi-screen</a></h4>

<p>Many of the hostile creatures that inhabit Magnamund have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack and greatly increases your defence against supernatural illusions and hypnosis.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Psi-screen: no points lost when attacked by Mindforce’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="nexus">Nexus</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Magnakai skill will enable you to withstand extremes of heat and cold without losing <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and to move items by your powers of concentration alone.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Nexus’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="dvnation">Divination</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Master of imminent or unseen danger or enable him to detect an invisible or hidden enemy. It may also reveal the true purpose or intent of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure. Divination may enable you to communicate telepathically with another person and to sense if a creature possesses psychic abilities.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Divination’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 10 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you may add a further Magnakai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in Book 11. This additional skill, together with your other Magnakai skills and any Special Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures may then be used in the next adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> series, which is called <a href="../lw/11tpot.htm#title"><cite>The Prisoners of Time</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you leave Anari and journey across Magnamund to the principality of Eru, the Senate of Tahou give you a <a href="#map">map of Ghatan and its surrounding territories</a>, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed books 1–9 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. You can carry a maximum of only fifty Crowns, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.</p>
<p>The Senate of Tahou, in gratitude for your help in saving their city from destruction, offer you a choice of equipment to aid you on your perilous mission. You can take five items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess. However, remember that you can carry a maximum of two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bow (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows. Tick them off as they are used.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Rope (Backpack Items)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Items) This potion restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for only one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Lantern (Backpack Items)<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">1</a></sup><br /><br />
</li>
<li>Mace (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>3 Meals (Meals) Each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Potion of Alether (Backpack Items) This potion of strength will increase your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by +2 points when swallowed immediately prior to a combat. It lasts for the duration of one combat only. There is enough for one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>List the five items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You do not need to make notes, but you should refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>Bow—carried in the hand.</li>

<p>The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve. Surplus Special Items may be left for safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given initial capitals (e.g. Gold Dagger, Magic Pendant) in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 3 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember that you can only carry two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bow and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is strongly recommended that you also equip yourself with a close combat weapon, like a Sword or Mace.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
If you enter combat armed only with a Bow, you must deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at any time.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, you may already possess Special Items.<br /><br />
The maximum number of Special Items that a Kai Master can carry during an adventure is twelve. Surplus Special Items may be left in safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Eru is the Lune, but Gold Crowns are readily accepted at an exchange rate of four Lune for every one Gold Crown.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 19.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Nightstalker’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (19 − 22 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as −3. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
<li>Nightstalker loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Magnakai Training</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles that are achieved by Kai Masters at each stage of their training. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> series, you will gain an additional Magnakai Discipline and progress towards the ultimate distinction of a Kai Warrior—Kai Grand Mastership.</p>

<h3><a name="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></h3>

<p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called ‘Lore-circles’. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>), and their physical and mental stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
<p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
<dd>Weaponmastery &amp; Huntmastery</dd>
<dt>Circle of Light</dt>
<dd>Animal Control &amp; Curing</dd>
<dt>Circle of Solaris</dt>
<dd>Invisibility, Huntmastery &amp; Pathsmanship</dd>
<dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
<dd>Psi-surge, Psi-screen, Nexus &amp; Divination</dd>
</dl>
<p>By completing a Lore-circle, you may add to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> the extra bonus points that are shown below.</p>
<h4><a name="lcbonus">Lore-circle Bonuses</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
<dd>+1 <small>CS</small>+2 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of Light</dt>
<dd>0 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of Solaris</dt>
<dd>+1 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
<dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
<dd>+3 <small>CS</small>+3 <small>EP</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>All bonus points that you acquire by completing a Lore-circle are additions to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores.</p>
<h3><a name="imprvdsc">Improved Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will steadily improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills), Tutelary (five skills), Principalin (six skills), or Mentora (seven skills), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>
<h4><a name="primate">Primate</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Primates with this Magnakai Discipline are able to repel an animal that is intent on harming them by blocking its sense of taste and smell. The level of success is dependent on the size and ferocity of the animal.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have the ability to delay the effects of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison he is able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and are able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Primates with the skill of Nexus will be able to offer a far greater resistance than before to the effects of noxious gases and fumes.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="tutelary">Tutelary</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to use defensive combat skills to great effect when fighting unarmed. When entering combat without a weapon, Tutelaries lose only 2 points from their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, instead of the usual 4 points.</dd>
<dt>Invisibility</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to increase the effectiveness of their skill when hiding from an enemy by drawing the enemy’s attention to a place other than that in which they are hiding. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill can detect an enemy ambush within 500 yards of their position unless their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score is low due to wounds sustained or lack of food.</dd>
<dt>Psi-screen</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill develop mental defences against magical charms and hostile telepathy. These defences increase in strength as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Divination</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries who possess this Magnakai Discipline are able to recognize objects or creatures with magical skills or abilities. However, this improved Discipline can be negated if the creature or object is shielded from detection.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="prncpln">Principalin</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this skill are able to call on a woodland animal (if nearby) to aid them, either in combat, or to act as a messenger or guide. The number of animals that can be summoned increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Invisibility</dt>
<dd>Principalins are able to mask any sounds made by their movements while using this skill.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this Magnakai Discipline are able to intensify their eyesight at will, giving them telescopic vision.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Principalins using this skill in combat are able to confuse an enemy by planting seeds of doubt in its mind. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this ability can extinguish fires by force of will alone. The size of the fire, and the number that can be extinguished using Nexus increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="mentora">Mentora</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Mentoras skilled in Weaponmastery are more accurate when using all missile weapons, whether fired (e.g. a bow) or thrown (e.g. a dagger). When using a bow or thrown weapon and instructed to pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, add 2 to the number picked if you are a Mentora with the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Mentoras with this skill are able to neutralize the effects of any poisons, venoms, or toxins with which they come into contact.</dd>
<dt>Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Mentoras who possess this Magnakai Discipline are able to cross any kind of terrain on foot without leaving any tracks, even if the ground is covered in snow.</dd>
<dt>Psi-screen</dt>
<dd>Mentoras with this ability can protect themselves from evil spirits and other non-corporeal beings that attack with psychic energy. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Divination</dt>
<dd>Mentoras who possess this skill are able to detect psychic residues lingering in a place where a dramatic event, such as a battle, a murder, a ritual sacrifice, or a ritual ceremony, has taken place. By meditating at the scene of the incident, a Kai Mentora is able to visualize the event, even though it may have occurred in the distant past.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Magnakai Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Disciplines section of future Lone Wolf books.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Magnakai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your quest to retrieve the last three Lorestones of Nyxator from the clutches of the Darklords will be fraught with deadly dangers. The evil host of Helgedad will summon their most brutal forces to thwart your Magnakai quest. Make notes as you progress through this story—they will be of great help in this and in future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will help you during your mission. Some Special Items will be of use in this and future Lone Wolf books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>Choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.</p>
<p>The restoration of the Kai and the future of your homeland depend on the success of this mission. May the spirit of your ancestors and the wisdom of the great God Kai guide you on the path of the Magnakai.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>It is dawn on midsummer’s day when you ride out of Tahou. Since your victory over Zakhan Kimah, your appearance in a public place has been enough to provoke spontaneous cheering from the Tahouese, who regard you as their saviour. But on this warm, sunny morning you leave the city unnoticed, for on this occasion you appear to be just another messenger.</p>
<p>The army uniform you wear and the white horse you ride are part of an elaborate deception conceived by the Elder Magi. In order to make Darklord Gnaag believe that you are returning to Sommerlund, you have given your Kai cloak and tunic to your friend Banedon. Disguised as you, he will leave for Sommerlund aboard his flying ship Skyrider this afternoon. A formal ceremony is planned to mark his departure and another awaits his arrival at the King’s Citadel in Holmgard. Gnaag has vowed to kill you: it is a vow which has become an obsession that torments him like a poisoned wound. It is hoped that Banedon’s much publicized flight home will lure Gnaag’s vengeful eyes away to the north and raise your chances of success at Torgar considerably.</p>
<p>Your ride ends in Firina, where you catch a barge down-river to the port of Talon. There you hear news of a rebellion in Barrakeesh, the Vassagonian capital, and reports of the sudden withdrawal of all Vassagonia’s troops from the lands she invaded early in the war. It bodes well for the continuing struggle against the Darklords, for Vassagonia was their only major ally. You spend one night in Talon before buying passage aboard a merchantman on its way along the Tentarias, and five days later you disembark at Garthen, the capital of Talestria.</p>
<p>Talestria was overrun in the early days of the war but the neighbouring country of Palmyrion came quickly to her aid. The armies of Talestria and Palmyrion united and fought the invading horde, led by Warlord Zegron of Ogia, on the battle-plains to the north of Garthen. For three days and three nights a bitter struggle raged and the allies were sorely pressed to withstand the overwhelming numbers of the enemy ranged against them. But on the morning of the fourth day, the unexpected arrival of the dwarven army of Bor was to seal Zegron’s doom. His mighty force crumbled and the survivors, fleeing northwards in chaos, were pursued relentlessly. The latest news tells of the allies’ capture of Xanar, a major Ogian stronghold, and their continued advance westward along the Blackshroud Trail.</p>
<p>The Royal Court of Queen Evaine would be honoured to assist you, but secrecy is paramount to the success of your quest and so you shun the Royal Palace and take lodgings instead at a humble dockside tavern. There you arrange transportation to Eru aboard a brigantine bound for Humbold, the Eruan capital, and leave next day on the noon tide. Upon your arrival, you make your way to the city’s ancient quarter where the Elder Magi have arranged a clandestine meeting with Prince Graygor. In the cellar of a disused warehouse, the young Prince waits patiently for your coming. Like you, he is dressed in the clothes of a messenger in order that he can walk the streets of his city incognito. He welcomes you with a salute, bringing his hand diagonally across his chest, and assures you that your true identity is known only to him. For over an hour you discuss your plans and listen to the Prince recount some of the events that have disturbed the peace of Eru. Two years ago, Drakkarim renegades from the Hammerlands attacked and overran his northern city of Luomi. The inhabitants were slaughtered and the holy temple of Luomi, around which the city was founded, was looted and burnt to the ground. Only recently did he learn from the Elder Magi that the ancient temple held the Lorestone of Luomi, one of the three Lorestones now locked in Torgar. At the time of the attack the Prince’s army was too small to repel the invaders and he was forced to abandon the city, as well as the border town of Cetza. But in the past month he has joined forces with King Sarnac of Lencia, and together they have recaptured Luomi and driven Baron Shinzar and his Hammerland rebels all the way back to Cetza, within thirty miles of the border.</p>
<p>The Prince invites you to accompany him to Luomi where he is to resume command of his army and lead them to battle. He provides you with a fine Eruan steed and a new disguise that will enable you to travel through Eru without drawing undue attention to yourself.</p>
<p>Dressed as an Eruan Pathfinder, one of an élite unit of woodsmen who operate in the harsh territories bordering the Hellswamp, you ride north with the Prince’s entourage and arrive at the city five days later. Every house, stable, tavern, and municipal building is filled to overflowing with knights and men at arms. But, despite their cramped billets and meagre rations, the soldiers of Eru and Lencia are in good spirits, for tomorrow they march against a foe they have already beaten in battle, and most are eager to finish the job once and for all. You are given lodgings within the main citadel of Luomi and later that evening, after the Prince has attended a war conference with King Sarnac, you meet in private to discuss the next stage of your quest.</p>
<p>‘There are two ways to reach Torgar,’ says the Prince, as you study the <a href="#map">map</a> given to you by the Senate of Tahou. ‘You can cross the River Brol and make your way northwards through the Moggador Forest, or you can go to Pirsi and seek out Sebb Jarel. He is the leader of a brave band of partisans who have ambushed and resisted the Drakkarim ever since they invaded. If there is a path to Torgar between the Hellswamp and the Isle of Ghosts, he will know it.’</p>
<p>You ponder the choices and wonder why the Prince has not suggested the simplest route of all: north across the Isle of Ghosts. When you mention this he shakes his head ominously. ‘The isle is cursed,’ he says, pointing at the <a href="#map">map</a> with an accusing finger. ‘Few have ever come out of that dreadful place alive. And of those poor wretches who have survived, only one has kept a grip of his sanity. His name is Sebb Jarel.’</p>
<p>Next day you rise with the dawn and prepare to set off on your journey to Torgar. There are two routes open to you: you can ride to Pirsi and seek out Sebb Jarel, the partisan leader, and the only man who can guide you through this treacherous wilderness; or you can accompany Prince Graygor to battle at Cetza. If his army beats the Drakkarim and forces them to retreat, the way across the River Brol will be open and you will be able to approach Torgar under cover of the Moggador Forest. Consult the <a href="#map">map</a> before you decide which route to take.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>Using your mastery of Nexus you extinguish the flames that are scorching your arm, and immediately set about helping those Palmyrions who have survived the devastating attack. Less than half are able to stand, but you manage to pull them into a defensive circle in time to fight the Drakkarim who are charging along the street.</p>

<p>Fear returns to tie a knot in your stomach as you detect the scent of live Akataz. Instinctively you flatten yourself to the ground and a twisting grey blur arcs over your head and crashes headlong into the undergrowth. You are unharmed but you sense that the dog is just the first of many that are rushing towards this part of the forest, drawn by the blood of their kin and the scent of your body. Before it can recover from its failed attack, you jump to your feet and sprint away.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>An hour before dawn, you leave Cetza and ride across the open grasslands that slope gently towards the River Brol. A full moon and the gathering light of day help you identify the landmarks that Prince Graygor told you to look out for to help guide you to a ford close to the site of an abandoned copper mine. His directions prove accurate and by mid-morning you find yourself on a ridge that overlooks the ford and its cluster of derelict mining huts.</p>

<p>You notice there is a spot where a gantry passes directly over the ball of green flame. If you could crawl to that spot you would be able to cup your hands below the Lorestones. Paido could then destroy the crystal rods, and the Lorestones, freed of the energy beams, would drop into your hands.</p>
<p>It is a bold plan but you feel confident that it will succeed.</p>

<h3><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>You share the officer’s horse as he leads his company back along a route they have already ridden. Steadily the road winds upwards through the hills towards a ridge of yellow rock and, as you reach the crest of the ridge, you catch your first awe-inspiring glimpse of Torgar.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration I]</div>
<p>The walls of this grim city-fortress stand upon the brink of a ravine cut deep by centuries of rushing water. A natural causeway of stone spans this dark chasm and provides the only means of approaching Torgar from the south. Its position and its defences seem impregnable. It commands the only road into the barren land of Ghatan, and any who dare travel that road must pass over the causeway and through the city’s great iron gate.</p>
<p>In the past there have been few who would venture willingly to Torgar, but now the causeway and its approaches swarm with such men. They are the soldiers of Talestria and Palmyrion, and they have come with their engines of war to lay siege to this grim Drakkarim fortress.</p>
<p>The scout officer spurs his horse away from the ridge and you are carried towards a cluster of tents that stand on high ground overlooking the siege-works. As you arrive, a group of knights steps forward to take the horse’s reins. You dismount with the officer and follow as he enters the largest tent.</p>

<h3><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>The captain grunts his approval and returns your salute. Then he catches sight of your signet ring and suddenly his mood becomes much more friendly. He orders the townsfolk to lower their pistols and return to their homes and begrudgingly they obey his command. ‘Come,’ he says, placing his hand on your shoulder. ‘You must be thirsty after your day’s ride.’</p>
<p>He pushes open the tavern door and draws aside a tattered leather curtain. A dozen pairs of eyes look towards you as you enter, stare briefly, and then return to their own business.</p>
<p>‘I see you come to Pirsi with the Prince’s favour,’ says the captain, casting a glance at the ring you wear as you raise the tankard of ale he places before you. ‘What news do you bring from the Royal Court?’</p>
<p>‘I’m here on a mission, a secret mission of great importance,’ you reply, guardedly. ‘I must speak with Sebb Jarel, for only he can help me accomplish the task. I am at liberty to say no more.’</p>
<p>The captain looks at you quizzically. ‘It’s unlike Prince Graygor to entrust such responsibility to one of your rank, soldier. If you expect me to take you to Jarel you have first to satisfy me that you’re a Pathfinder. That bandit Baron Shinzar has sent men to find Jarel before—on missions of assassination. I want proof you’re not another one of his agents.’</p>
<p>He peers over your shoulder towards the tavern bar and signals to the owner by blinking three times.

He retreats towards the centre of the temple and leaps onto the marble block. There is a chilling howl and suddenly the shadowy chamber is flooded with a blinding light. Thunder booms and the walls shake. Terrified, Roark and his companions flee through the shattered doors and scramble up the stairs. Crackling bolts of white lightning leap from the marble block to tear great chunks of rock from the walls, and the air seethes with a cloying stench that threatens to suffocate you.

<p>Swiftly you inform the captains of the reserve regiments of the danger facing their Prince. At first they are reluctant to take orders from a Pathfinder, whose rank is inferior to theirs, but the logic of your argument and your forceful character persuades them to comply with your commands.</p>
<p>Trumpets announce the advance and you set off across the body-strewn battlefield with a force 900 strong. Pikemen lead the column with archers close behind, and bringing up the rear are a levy of militia, many of whom lived in Cetza before the Drakkarim invaded. Their morale is high for this is their chance to recover their homes and their land.</p>
<p>Tensely you watch as the enemy attack. The Palace Guard link shields but, as the Hammerlanders slam into their line, they buckle and waver beneath the crushing onslaught. As your force crosses the ditch, you pray that the Prince and his men have strength enough to hold for just a few minutes more.</p>

<p>For several hours you follow an ancient pavement that mostly lies buried beneath the rich black soil of the forest floor. Occasionally you discover a heap of moss-covered slabs; they are all that remain of dwellings built long before the trees conquered the isle. It is late afternoon when you reach a clearing in the middle of which stands a decaying structure of mould-encrusted stone. The building is an immense ziggurat which is so overgrown that it appears to be a part of the surrounding soil and vegetation.</p>
<p>A section of this verdant growth has been cleared to reveal two massive doors of solid crystal set into the lowest level.</p>

<p>A laugh, deep and guttural, rumbles from the far side of the cavern. ‘I see Skalir’s play-actin’ ain’t good enough to fool you, Pathfinder,’ says a man who, until now, has been watching silently in the shadows. As he steps forward, the fire casts a warm glow over his massive frame. He stands over six-and-a-half-feet tall, his face is covered by a thick red beard, and he has a shock of bright red hair that cascades over the wolfskin cloak slung over his shoulders. He smiles, his green eyes bright and piercing, set wide beneath an intelligent brow.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration III]</div>
<p>‘Check on the sentries, Skalir,’ he instructs his lieutenant. ‘And make sure they’ve got their wits about ’em tonight.’ Obediently, the mouse-like man and his four companions leave the chamber. As the curtain is pulled across the archway, the red-haired giant motions you to sit with him at the fire. ‘I am Jarel,’ he says. ‘What do you want from me?’</p>

Once you have been briefed, he sends for some black clothing for you to wear instead of your grey Pathfinder’s uniform and some burnt cork with which to blacken your face and hands. You are then escorted to the edge of the encampment, close to the dusty road on which the army marched from Luomi. The guards tell you that the password is ‘broadsword’.

<p>The bear knows the forest well: he knows its treasures and its dangers. Carefully you follow in his tracks as he works his way through the pines towards the edge of a deep gorge, where a trail descends gently to the bank of a rushing river. Massive boulders, smoothed by centuries of erosion, rise from the foaming torrent like giant stepping stones. Across the river lies another forest, dark and forbidding. Although the sun is strong in the cloudless sky and the air is warm and dry, a grey mist hangs heavy and cold around the trees of that forest.</p>
<p>All along the bank on this side of the river grow clumps of bushy herbs with bright red flowers. The bear scoops a pawful of the scarlet petals and chews them contentedly as he nods farewell and ambles back into the forest.</p>

A deafening roar reverberates through the town as the men discharge their unwieldy pistols, but the lead shot passes harmlessly over your head and buries itself in the tavern door. The noise stirs a hornets’ nest of activity as the rest of the townsfolk arm themselves and rush into the street to investigate the commotion.

Jarel volunteers for the first watch while you settle down gratefully on a bed of leaf mould and drift off into a dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>It feels as if you have only just closed your eyes when you are awoken by the savage and desolate howl of a Taintor wolf.</p>

<p>Four men die before the shield-wall knits together and the lost ground is regained. The Hammerlanders reel back and the Brigandi surge forward, but they too cannot break through the Palace Guard. A trumpet sounds in the distance and the Prince’s men cheer when they see their reserves streaming up the hill to support them. Two hundred Eruan pikemen press forward behind their bristling steel and take the enemy in the flank. The attack is devastating. The enemy are split asunder and swept from the slope. The pikemen halt and through their ranks a wave of archers moves forward to fire at the backs of the retreating foe. Retreat turns to rout as the Hammerlanders and Brigandi flee the field in chaos.</p>

<p>Stealthily you follow Paido through the dungeons of Torgar, using the shadows to avoid being seen. Ragged columns of slaves stumble along the passages, dragging their tortured, half-starved bodies to and from the work pits. They are beaten, cursed, and whipped relentlessly by their Drakkarim guards, who seem to delight in their suffering.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration V]</div>
<p>You emerge from a corridor into the shadows of a circular chamber, where a staircase ascends to a pair of huge triangular iron doors guarded by a squad of crack Drakkarim Death Knights. A tingling sensation electrifies your skin as your senses detect the presence of the Lorestones somewhere behind these doors. Suddenly an alarm bell fills the chamber with a deafening clangour; the Death Knights begin to descend the stairs and your stomach churns with the fear that you have been detected.</p>

<p>Curiosity overcomes your natural caution and you decide to investigate the fascinating structure. You discover that the undergrowth has only recently been chopped away to give access to the doors where gaping, fire-blackened holes are all that remain of the crystal locks that held them secure for centuries. Beyond the damaged doors a dry, dark tunnel slopes gently downwards. It twists as it descends to a chamber, which is huge and empty, and ringed by a score of openings. A green glow and the faint thrumming of discordant chanting draws you to one of these many portals. Beyond it a staircase delves deeper into the earth.</p>
<p>As you make your way carefully downward, the air becomes increasingly humid and chill. The stairs are slick with moisture and crawling with spiders and other many-legged creatures that scuttle away from your feet. You count sixty steps before the staircase ends at a huge door stained black with damp and age. It is slightly ajar and, as you peer through the crack, you are chilled to the core by what lies beyond.</p>

At length, having heard your earnest appeal for him to guide you, he raises his eyes from the fire and holds you with their piercing gaze.</p>
<p>‘You speak with courage and wisdom, Kai Lord. It is rare to find these virtues present so strongly in one so young. The help you beg me to provide could cost my life, yet you offer no reward, save the thanks of some distant land and the slender promise of a better age.

<p>The ground to the west of Cetza is flat and featureless and offers very little cover to conceal your approach. Slowly you work your way through the knee-high grasses to within twenty yards of a stone bridge, where the roadway crosses a foul-smelling ditch and enters the town. Your every movement is stiff with caution now, for the bridge is barricaded and you can see the spiky black helmets of the enemy defenders glinting in the moonlight. Snake-like you wriggle forwards, slide down into the ditch and take shelter beneath the stone bridge. With one cheek pressed against the wet stone you strain your ears to hear what the enemy are saying. You recognize their harsh, ugly language—it is Giak—but it is being spoken by human voices. The only humans to speak it so fluently are the Death Knights, the élite of the Drakkarim.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud splash that sends your pulse racing: a spear has fallen close to where you are hiding and its shaft stands upright in the muddy water. A growling curse is followed by the sound of heavy boots descending the bank as an angry Death Knight comes to retrieve the weapon he dropped.</p>

You turn your eyes towards Torgar and defiantly you vow to avenge his death by retrieving the stolen Lorestones from the dungeons of that dread citadel.</p>
<p>Your journey along the bank of the River Torg is a long and tiring ordeal. For eight days you trudge through the black mud, cut off from all view of the lands to the north and south by an unbroken wall of stunted trees. The only inhabitants of this forsaken territory are the buzzing insects which hang seemingly motionless in the humid air. They are a constant source of irritation but at least their bite proves harmless.</p>
<p>On the morning of the ninth day, the muddy river bank gives way to firmer ground and the trees become less dense. Ahead you can see a barren expanse of yellow sulphurous soil that marks the beginning of the Nadulritzaga foothills. You can also see a road of broken stones disappearing into the distance.</p>

The Drakkarim huddle shoulder to shoulder and nervously dig the butts of their pikes into the hillside to steady their shaky hands. The knights reach the hill. They thunder up the slope. A blaze of lightning hurtles from the top of the temple but it is mistimed: it crackles harmlessly over their heads and explodes behind them, hurling nothing but scorched earth into the sky.

<p>Silently you move through the shallow sludge of water and mud, hidden by the bank of the ditch from the watchful eyes of the Drakkarim sentries. Beyond the ditch the ground rises to a low wall, which encircles a field of cultivated trees. It is an apple orchard and it is full of enemy soldiers, huddled around their campfires or asleep beneath the fruit-laden branches. Beyond the orchard lies an expanse of open grassland covered with tents and makeshift paddocks full of horses. Here, then, are Baron Shinzar’s reinforcements—over 600 cavalry newly-arrived from Blackshroud. You commit every detail to memory before leaving the ditch and making your way back stealthily to the allies’ camp.</p>

<p>Your journey northwards through the Moggador Forest is a long and tiring trek that is fraught with danger. Roving bands of Krorn and packs of savage timber wolves demand that you remain vigilant at all times, and as you venture deeper into their vast domain, you feel your sense of time gradually slipping away. Your only consolation on this long and lonely trek is that wild game is plentiful and you experience no shortage of food.</p>
<p>On the morning of your ninth day in the forest you notice that the grey pines are beginning to thin out and the ground is becoming dusty and sparsely vegetated. Soon you come upon a road constructed of broken stones which leaves the forest and disappears into a barren landscape of yellow sulphurous soil.

<p>A short distance from Lord Adamas’ tent stands a wooden watchtower, constructed by his army engineers, which offers an unobstructed view of the causeway and the great gate of Torgar. As you reach the top of its rickety ladder and step onto the platform beside the Lord Constable, he recounts the events that have led to the siege of this city-fortress.</p>
<p>Following his victory over the Ogians and the destruction of Xanar, Adamas led the allied armies of Bor, Talestria, and Palmyrion along the Blackshroud Trail in pursuit of the shattered enemy. When they reached the <i xml:lang="x-giak">Agna-kor-kuzim</i>, the ‘road of slaves’, the army of Bor was detached and sent to assail Blackshroud from the east, while the bulk of the allied forces marched north towards Torgar. When Talestria was overrun in the early days of the war, thousands of her people were taken as slaves and imprisoned here in this fortress. Lord Adamas had sworn that one day he would free them and he was determined to fulfil his pledge.</p>
<p>During the march north, a great battle was fought near the wastelands of Zuttezna, against two Giak armies led by Darklord Kraagenskûl and Darklord Chlanzor. Both were soundly defeated by the allies and sent back to Cragmantle to lick their wounds. Although victorious at Zuttezna, the allies had suffered heavy losses and Adamas feared they would be too weak to storm Torgar. He was too far from his homeland for reinforcements to reach him swiftly, and there was the growing threat that the Darklords would muster their troops in Tanoz and Mozgôar and attack again. Faced with this grave dilemma he decided to risk an assault on Torgar.</p>
<p>‘We have means to breach their iron gate,’ he says, staring purposefully at the great door of Torgar. ‘The Elder Magi have given us a device that will reduce it to twisted scrap, and when we march through that portal and free our people, we shall have all the reinforcements we need.’</p>

<p>On your left, the Prince’s reserves respond to a signal from the hill and advance to support their leader. On your right, massed ranks of Lencian spearmen are locked in pitched combat the length of the orchard wall.

One such defender, an élite Drakkarim Death Knight, hacks his way through the leading pikemen and slays your horse with one terrible blow of his two-handed axe. As you fall, he draws back his weapon, its razor-sharp blade trailing scarlet spray, and prepares to strike at your neck.</p>

<p>The foot knights of Lencia are the first to go forward, their densely packed columns marching in perfect order towards the bridge at the centre of the enemy line. As they come within range there is a sound like rushing water and a cloud of black arrows pours down on their armoured ranks. Huge gaps appear in the line and the columns seem to sway under the impact before continuing the assault. They are flanked to the south by crossbowmen, who are firing their weapons as they advance. Unlike the knights, they wear very little armour and over half their number are felled by arrows when they halt to reload their cumbersome bows. The survivors retreat, taking cover among the massed ranks of Lencian spearmen who are advancing towards the orchard.</p>

<p>You reach a square near the centre of the town where a unit of enemy reserves are gathered, awaiting the order to join the battle. They are Krorn—hideous-looking creatures from the Moggador and Akamazim forests. They are approached by a swarthy giant of a man, with a short black beard and shiny bald head, who brandishes a massive war-axe fashioned from a fiery red metal. The axe must weigh more than its wielder but he waves it above his head as if it were no heavier than a stick of wood. Judging from his features and from what you have heard during your travels through Eru, this warrior is Baron Shinzar—the enemy commander.</p>

<p>Majestically the Palace Guard advance across the field of battle, their lances raised like the spines of a steel porcupine, their scarlet and yellow pennons streaming behind them in the wind. The enemy shower them with a rain of arrows, yet the Eruans seemingly ignore these deadly shafts and continue undeterred. It is not until they reach the ditch that the constant bow-fire begins to abrade their ranks. However, it does little to slow their pace as the Prince gives the order to charge. The knights level their lances as they reach the bottom of the hill. Above them a regiment of Drakkarim pikemen brace themselves to receive the attack and a blaze of lightning hurtles down from the temple wall. You wince as it streaks down the hill, but miraculously it misses its intended target and explodes near the ditch, hurling nothing but scorched mud and the bodies of those already slain into the sky.</p>
<p>The Prince’s battle-cry rings out and his knights slam into the Drakkarim to break like a wave against their wall of pikes. The Prince and a small group of his stoutest guardsmen break through and gallop on towards the temple whilst the remaining knights engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The Prince and his group reach the temple and you see them dismount and enter the ruins. Such bravery stirs your admiration, for they know the deadly danger that lurks there, yet they confront it unflinchingly.</p>

<p>The presence of the phantoms has triggered a spell that was cast upon the whip long ago by a former owner. Whenever the Bullwhip comes into contact with undead beings, it protects its owner by radiating a power that is abhorrent to them.</p>

<p>The walls of this grim city-fortress stand upon the brink of a ravine cut deep by centuries of rushing water. A natural causeway of stone spans the dark chasm and provides the only means of approaching Torgar from the south. It has an enviable position and its defences seem impregnable.

<p>‘Impostor!’ bellows the captain, and lunges forward to grab you by the throat. But you sidestep his attack deftly and strike a blow to his temple with the heel of your palm that renders him unconscious in an instant.</p>
<p>‘Fire!’ shouts a bull-necked Pirsian, and you throw yourself to the ground. A deafening roar reverberates through the town as the men discharge their unwieldy pistols, but the lead shot passes harmlessly over your head and buries itself in the tavern door. The noise stirs a hornets’ nest of activity as the townsfolk arm themselves and rush into the street to investigate the commotion. The situation looks desperate, but you can see a chance to escape and you take it. The pistols created a huge cloud of white smoke and under cover of this acrid cloud you scurry down an alley beside the log tavern and leap headlong into the foliage and trees beyond.</p>

It would be wise to avoid them, but in order to reach the ford you have to pass close by the bushes. From what little you can hear of their conversation, they are arguing over some fish they have caught. As you creep nearer you pray that their argument will keep them distracted long enough for you to reach the river unseen.</p>

When they are sure that you are unconscious, their sergeant leaves his position and descends by rope into the gorge, his nose and mouth covered by a pad of Golta leaves to counter the intoxicating scent. He had intended to bundle you onto your horse and lead you from the gorge to where the mountain air would revive you, but on reaching your body his suspicions are aroused. The ring and uniform you wear indicate that you are a Pathfinder with a message from Prince Graygor, but the weapons you carry, and your fair hair and Northland features are not those of an élite Eruan soldier. He rolls you over onto your stomach and is horrified to discover Halgar’s Bullwhip tied to your backpack, its copper-studded coils stained with his blood. He knows that Halgar would never have parted willingly with the weapon, for it had made him as respected a fighter as his brother, Sebb Jarel. Anger, fuelled by shock, stirs the sergeant to a fit of rage. He is convinced that you are a Drakkar, an assassin sent by Baron Shinzar to murder the brothers Jarel.

Your eyes are drawn to this point, for here you can see the three remaining Lorestones of Nyxator, the objects of your quest, held suspended in a ball of flickering green flame.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XIII]</div>
<p>The harsh <i>clang</i> of the alarm bell, and the sudden sight of you silhouetted in the doorway, has startled the creatures. They slink away from the pit and escape through an archway, leaving you and Paido alone in the chamber.</p>

<p>‘Over here!’ calls Jarel, pulling open the rot-infested door of a hut at the water’s edge. Inside you see an overturned rowboat with a pair of battered oars shipped underneath. He turns the small craft over and raises it by the stern.</p>
<p>‘Give a hand,’ he says, straining to push it forward. You place the oars inside, lift the bow, and help him launch it gently into the river. ‘This brings back some memories,’ says Jarel, wistfully. ‘Though I never thought I’d ever be sharing this little booty-runner with a Pathfinder!’</p>
<p>You toss your pack into the boat and take your place opposite the partisan leader as he fixes the oars into position. Then, with a smooth stroke, he propels the boat out into the current and you begin your voyage towards the sinister channels of the Hellswamp.</p>

<p>There is a flash as your weapon smites the link and severs the amulet from the chain.

The strong current bears you steadily northwards and Jarel is content to allow the boat to drift with the flow while he enjoys the warm sunshine and your conversation. You learn much about your guide and the land of Eru, and in return you recount the legends of Sommerlund and tell of your adventures in the realms of Magnamund.</p>
<p>At dusk you reach a confluence where the river is joined by another that flows in from the east. Here the currents are swift and treacherous, but Jarel steers the boat masterfully and brings it ashore at a muddy beach on the west bank, where a small stone hut stands close to the river’s edge. You are dragging the boat up the muddy shore when Jarel suddenly freezes in his tracks. A movement among the tall grasses that fringe the beach has alerted him to a pair of green, pig-like eyes glinting in the gloom. ‘Keep still,’ he whispers, fearfully. ‘It could be a Gorodon.’ His fears are confirmed as the shadowy creature leaves its hiding place among the grasses and comes crawling down the beach towards you.</p>

<p>In the company of a dozen bodyguards and court heralds, you follow the Prince as he makes his way on foot to King Sarnac’s camp. It is his usual practice to inspect his soldiers on the eve of battle, to see for himself that all is well and to raise their spirits with a few words of praise and encouragement. He is heartened to discover their morale is already high and that they are all confident that he will lead them to victory.</p>
<p>At length you arrive at the Lencian headquarters. A huge yellow flag, bearing the emblem of a white swan and blue dragon, flutters in the breeze above the royal tent where a unit of silver-clad knights stands stiffly to attention. A trumpet announces your arrival and the knights escort you inside to meet the King. After formal greetings have been exchanged, the grey-haired King begins to discuss the impending battle. The Prince has brought with him a detailed map of the town and, as the two leaders formulate their plans, it is used to mark the places where their regiments will assemble and attack the enemy.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XIV]</div>
<p>‘If only we knew the number of reinforcements Baron Shinzar has received,’ says the King, uneasily. ‘Then we could be sure our plans would succeed.’ The Prince nods in agreement. ‘We must send a scout to reconnoitre their defences, or hundreds of our soldiers could lose their lives needlessly in the assault.’</p>
<p>The King looks in your direction then returns his eyes to the Prince. ‘I have no scouts trained for such a delicate operation,’ he says, ‘but I see you have a Pathfinder. Send him. His skills would be well suited to this task.’</p>
<p>The Prince hesitates. He cannot reasonably refuse the King’s suggestion, yet to send you into the enemy camp would endanger your life and your quest.</p>

The sun is strong in a cloudless sky and the air is warm and dry, yet a grey mist hangs heavy and cold around the trees of that forest.</p>
<p>All along the bank on this side of the river grow clumps of bushy herbs with bright scarlet flowers.</p>

<p>At the break of dawn the soldiers of Lencia and Eru rouse themselves and adopt their positions for the fight. You gather your equipment and join the Prince at the top of the hill on which he has established his command post. He is observing the enemy line through a telescope and dictating orders to his heralds, who commit his words to parchment and dispatch them to his regiments in the field.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XVI]</div>
<p>‘We outnumber the enemy two to one, but they are well positioned to receive our attack,’ comments the Prince, handing you his telescope so that you can scan their lines.</p>
<p>The town of Cetza is little more than a handful of ruined cottages clustered on a flat-topped hill. To the north lies a wood and a small hill on which a ruined temple stands; to the south lies an orchard surrounded by a low wall, and further on, open grassland bisected by a ditch that runs the whole length of the battlefield. The road from Luomi crosses the ditch at a stone bridge which is barricaded and heavily defended. The enemy have also been busy to the north. A mass of pointed stakes form a barrier between the two hills to impede any attempt by cavalry to break through the centre, and all along this defensive line are row upon row of Drakkarim archers.</p>
<p>An unnatural calm descends on the field, as though time momentarily stands still. Suddenly the quiet is shattered by a fanfare of trumpets from King Sarnac’s camp. It is the signal to advance.</p>

<p>His prediction comes true, for it is mid-morning when you arrive at a ragged group of plank huts on the bank of a fast-flowing river. At one time these shanties were the thriving centre of illegal trafficking in gold and gems. The citizens of Pirsi, who mine these rich resources in the Eru Range, used to smuggle their precious cargoes out of the country by boat, choosing to risk the dangers of the Hellswamp rather than pay the Prince his taxes. It was only after the Prince decreed the death penalty for such smuggling, and employed Pathfinders to help enforce his law, that the Pirsians finally gave up their illegal trade.</p>

<p>As the Palace Guard advance majestically, their serried ranks of steel slowly change formation in preparation for the Prince’s order to charge. Heavy lances rise like the spines of a steel porcupine and their scarlet and yellow pennons unfurl to the wind. A wave of arrows comes flying towards you, sent by the Drakkarim standing behind their fence of stakes, but the range is long and the black shafts rattle harmlessly off Eruan armour and shields.</p>
<p>The first rank of horsemen reach the ditch to find the earth soft and waterlogged. The ruined temple lies 300 yards ahead, and before it a line of Drakkarim pikemen stand grimly silent on the slope of the hill. A war-horn blares its signal and suddenly all hell breaks loose. Arrows pour down on all sides: from the enemy archers to the right and from archers, previously unseen, lurking in the woods to the left. Many shafts find their way through the sides of helmets and between plates of polished armour. Still the Prince commands his men onwards and they force their horses across the ditch, braving the savage hail of death. You survive the arrows and steer your horse through the cloying mud, but you are knocked from the saddle by a riderless steed maddened by the pain of its wounds.</p>

<p>A tingling sensation electrifies your senses and fills your mind with images of events which took place in this temple thousands of years ago. So strong are the psychic residues that linger here that the images appear breathtakingly vivid.</p>
<p>During the Age of the Old Kingdoms, when the Elder Magi ruled the land, this temple was a place of learning and experimentation. It was here they developed their knowledge and understanding of nature, and many beneficial discoveries were made to the betterment of Magnamund. The guardians of this laboratory were a Drodarin race called the Patar. They served the Elder Magi and in return they were entrusted with their newfound secrets of herbcraft and druidic lore. But the Patar betrayed that trust when they allowed the Cenerese, a clan of evil druids, into the temple to plunder its secrets. The Cenerese called upon their Demonlord, who appeared in this very chamber. He took all that the Elder Magi had nurtured and cultivated, and he turned it against them in the form of a deadly plague that decimated their race. In the wake of their destruction, the Cenerese and Patar rose to power, but their reign was short-lived. A clan of goodly druids called the Herbalish, who had helped the surviving Elder Magi to escape their enemies during the years of the Great Plague, waged war on the Cenerese and were victorious.</p>
<p>The Patar fled the temple in shame and gave a solemn pledge to the Herbalish that they would redeem their act of treachery by devoting themselves to the study of the healing arts and by striving to defeat disease in all its forms. Ever since, the descendants of the Patar have been known as the Redeemers, and each new generation has upheld that ancient vow.</p>
<p>But the story has yet to find an ending, for in this forgotten temple you are now witnessing a terrifying repeat of history. Roark and his followers are Cenerese Druids and they have come here once more to invoke the help of their master—the Demonlord Tagazin.</p>

<p>Since the first rays of dawn light brightened the eastern sky, the streets of Luomi echoed to the shouts of sergeants and the crunch of booted feet. The regiments of Lencia and Eru are taking their places in the column of march, and by mid-morning this column, 6500 strong, is ready to leave for battle. Company by company, through the city’s east gate, they depart, tramping the dusty road that leads to Cetza. When the time comes for you to join them you take your place with Prince Graygor’s escort and fall in line behind the armoured knights of the Palace Guard.</p>
<p>The army is well protected by Lencian horse scouts before, behind, and on both sides, to make sure it is not ambushed whilst crossing the twenty miles of open grasslands to Cetza. During the afternoon a troop of scouts are sent ahead to spy on the enemy. They return to report that Baron Shinzar has fortified the town and received reinforcements from Blackshroud since his defeat at Luomi. The news does not cheer Prince Graygor, for he knows the ground around Cetza does not favour the attacker.</p>
<p>It is dusk when the army arrives on the outskirts of the town. In the gloom you can see the enemy campfires flickering between the ruins of cottages that were destroyed when the Drakkarim first invaded this land. Occasionally their gruff voices can be heard on the chill evening wind as they shout orders and call the names of slaves and attendants. After a whole tiring day’s marching, and with night drawing close, the order goes round that there will be no battle offensive this evening. Quickly the regiments disperse and many fires are lit. Tents are erected for the knights and the baggage carts are unloaded to provide the men with stores that should make their night in the open less uncomfortable. The Prince chooses to position his headquarters on a hill to the north that overlooks the town, and King Sarnac of Lencia chooses a similar position on a hill beyond the road, half a mile to the south. Shortly after the tents are constructed, a message arrives from King Sarnac’s headquarters, inviting the Prince to join him and draw up plans for tomorrow’s battle. The Prince accepts the invitation and says that you may accompany him if you wish.</p>

Further along the narrow trail you come across the grisly remains of one such ambush. A score of severed Drakkarim heads, still encased in skull-like helms of black iron, have been impaled upon a line of wooden stakes.

Thunder booms and the walls shake. Terrified, Roark’s followers flee the temple and scramble up the stairs. Crackling bolts of white lightning leap from the marble block to tear great chunks of rock from the walls, and the air seethes with a cloying stench that threatens to suffocate you.

You grip your weapon tightly and prepare to strike him a fatal blow should he see you hiding in the shadows, but you do not need to attack. He snatches up the spear in his mailed fist, turns, and hauls himself out of the ditch, grunting and cursing his carelessness as he struggles in his heavy armour.</p>
<p>You wait twenty minutes before leaving the bridge and working your way slowly along the ditch.</p>

<p>The officer looks at you as if you are insane. ‘The crazy fool thinks he’s a Kai Lord,’ he says scornfully to his men as he climbs back into his saddle. ‘The foul air of this wilderness has addled his brains. Let us ride on; we’ve wasted too much time here already.’</p>
<p>He spurs his horse forward and you are forced to dive aside as the riders surge across the bridge and disappear along the road that leads to the Moggador Forest.</p>

<p>With your heart pounding fit to burst, you gulp a lungful of air and leap into the gorge. For a few seconds you lose your orientation as you tumble in the air then you hit the river with a stunning crash: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>You soon surface but the current is very strong and you cannot resist being swept along. For over a mile you ride the icy white water until your feet touch some smooth rocks as they speed past below. By kicking out against these boulders you are able to propel yourself towards the bank. Cold and exhausted, you eventually claw your way out of the water and collapse on the rocky shore.</p>
<p>The jump and your river ride have taken their toll on your possessions. Delete the items you have listed second, third, fifth, and seventh in the Backpack section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. Also, delete half the contents of your Belt Pouch and one Special Item of your choice.</p>

<p>Dust clogs your throat and the roar of falling stone is deafening as you race towards the surface. When you reach the ramp that leads to the crystal doors you find it split wide open. A web of cracks zigzags across the two halves and a growing mound of rubble threaten to seal off the exit. Desperately you claw your way across this jagged debris, passing the bodies of some of Roark’s followers, and diving through the shrinking exit just before the ceiling collapses with a tremendous crash.</p>
<p>Outside the situation is remarkably calm; only a slight ground tremor and a sound like distant thunder hint at the incredible destruction taking place inside the temple. The clearing is deserted and you are beginning to think you are the only one to have escaped, when you hear horses galloping away and glimpse three riders disappearing along a track that heads off to the east. It is nearly dark and they are soon swallowed by the shadows of the forest.</p>

<p>As you approach the partisans you hold up your right hand to display your signet ring. It is enough to convince them that you speak the truth.</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ says their sergeant, a tall lantern-jawed man with iron-grey hair. ‘We shall take you to our leader. But you must agree to wear a blindfold. It is for your own good as well as ours. The Drakkarim torture their prisoners: should you fall into their hands you’ll not be able to tell them where we are encamped.’ He pulls a length of cloth from his saddlebag and wraps it tightly around your eyes. Then another takes hold of your reins and leads you away from the gorge. After two hours in the saddle you finally reach your destination and the blindfold is removed.</p>

<p>A creeping numbness paralyses your limbs and, as your fingers lose their strength, you cannot prevent yourself from falling into the bore-hole after the Black Yua that injected you with its deadly venom.</p>
<p>You survive the fall but the strength of the venom ensures that you will never escape from the shaft.</p>

<p>With devastating speed and accuracy, you draw your Arrows and fire them deep into the hearts of the two enemy archers. Both men stagger and crumple to the ground, but your bowmanship does little to deter their comrades. With a fearsome yell, the three remaining warriors brandish their swords and axes and come thundering towards you. There is no time to evade their attack—you must fight them to the death!</p>

<p>On the other side of the alley is a line of burnt-out cottages. Their soot-blackened walls are mostly intact, although their roofs have long been open to the sky. The fleeing Drakkarim are beginning to outdistance your men and you fear they will get away, when suddenly they halt and turn to face you.</p>
<p>At that instant a mass of leather-clad Hammerlanders emerge from the cottages, rending the air with their howling battle-cries. They strike your men from every side, catching them like helpless fish in a barrel.</p>

<p>A group of high-ranking warriors are gathered around a table on which lies a map of Ghatan and the Hammerlands. They are engrossed in their plans for an assault across the causeway and they do not notice you enter the tent. The officer speaks with one of the lords, who leaves the table to come and question you.</p>
<p>‘Welcome, Pathfinder,’ he says, his keen eyes glinting like two polished gemstones. ‘I am Adamas, Lord Constable of Garthen, commander-in-chief of the Talestrian army. What news do you bring from Eru?’</p>
<p>Rather than risk raising his suspicions, you tell him of the Eruan-Lencian alliance and their successful struggle against the forces of Baron Shinzar of Blackshroud. He listens with interest to your report, and then he asks how you came to be 200 miles from Prince Graygor’s army.</p>

<p>The shouts of the Drakkarim and the rain of their arrows unnerve the guards. They fear it is the prelude to a night attack, and when they see a black-clad figure stumbling towards them and hear him give the wrong password, they panic. ‘Enemy attack!’ they shout, waking a unit of crossbowmen stationed on the high ground behind. They rush to grab their loaded weapons and take aim at the enemy, but the only target they can see is you. ‘Fire at will!’ commands their sergeant.</p>
<p>A scything wave of iron bolts lifts you off your feet and a terrifying pain tears through your chest. You are mortally wounded and, although you fight to hold on to life, it is a struggle you cannot win.</p>

<p>When you are halfway down the staircase a shadow looms into view. Seconds later a Drakkarim officer appears and begins to ascend. He is the most repugnant human being you have ever seen. His enormous bloated body bulges with over-developed muscles to the point of deformity and his face is puffy and fat, shiny with sweat, and pitted with disease. A battle wound on his right cheek has scarred badly, drawing that side of his face into an ugly sneer. He sees you and unsheathes a massive, saw-edged scimitar as he strides up the stairs and attacks.</p>

<p>Your Arrow passes clean through the creature’s mouth, tearing a jagged hole in its furry jowl. The beast shrieks at the sudden pain and shakes its head, spraying you with thick crimson blood. Maddened by the pain, it snaps its great fangs and rolls its grim yellow eyes as it steadies itself to pounce on you and exact its revenge.</p>
<p>Hurriedly you drop your Bow and unsheathe a hand weapon as the wolf springs towards your chest.</p>

<p>‘Vengeance is mine, Lone Wolf!’ booms the thunderous voice. Terror strikes deep in your heart when you turn and see the ghastly form of Darklord Gnaag, filling the archway through which his minions escaped when first you entered this chamber. A ghastly rasping laugh echoes from his fly-like head as he raises a black crystal and points it at the gantry. ‘The vow I gave at Tahou shall be fulfilled. Now I shall destroy you and the Lorestones!’</p>
<p>There is a deafening crack and a bolt of blue lightning streaks from the stone held in his pincer-like claw. It shears through the rusty metal and you are peppered with red-hot iron splinters. As the shock wave hits the weakened ball of fire, the two Lorestones are sent tumbling into the black abyss. Then a second bolt from the black stone tears the gantry in two, and with the ghastly laugh of Darklord Gnaag ringing in your ears, you plummet headlong into the icy cold pit.</p>
<p>You have fallen into a portal of total darkness, a Shadow Gate that leads to the twilight world of Daziarn. The wisdom and strength of the Lorestone of Luomi is now a part of your body and spirit, and the last remaining Lorestones are still within your reach, but your descent into the Daziarn heralds the beginning of a deadly, supernatural episode of the Magnakai Quest.</p>
<p>If you have the courage of a true Kai master, the wonders and the horrors of the twilight plane await you in Book 11, the penultimate Magnakai adventure, entitled:</p>

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
