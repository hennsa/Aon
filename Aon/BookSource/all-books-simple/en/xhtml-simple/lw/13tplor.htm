<div class="frontmatter">

   <p>You are the warrior Lone Wolf—Kai Grand Master of Sommerlund. You have defeated the Darklords of Helgedad and avenged your murdered ancestors, but now you are challenged by a sinister evil which threatens to destroy all life on your home world of Magnamund.</p>

   <p>In <strong><cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite></strong>, your mission is to prevent the malevolent Cener Druids of Ruel from releasing a deadly plague virus that will destroy all but their own kind. Of all the warriors of Magnamund only you can thwart their wicked plans—for only you possess the disciplines of a Kai Grand Master.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund and sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of your élite warrior caste.</p>
<p>It is the year MS 5075 and twenty-five years have passed since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain—the Darklands—and caused the destruction of their leader, Archlord Gnaag, and the core of their cancerous power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>
<p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Northern Magnamund. Some factions which were part of this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war, which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Skilfully their commanders exploited the chaos and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.</p>
<p>For five years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction, the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and you have begun the task of training a Second Order of Kai warriors so that the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors will be carried forward in the centuries to come. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>
<p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection—to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>
<p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and organized the training of the Second Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded and, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>
<p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power that you had recovered during your quest for the Magnakai. It was here, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, that you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors—Banedon and Rimoah—you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines and grasp the fundamental secrets of Left-handed and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
<p>At this time many changes were also occurring beyond the borders of Sommerlund. In the regions to the northeast of Magador and the Maakengorge, the Elder Magi of Dessi and the Herbwardens of Bautar were working together in an effort to restore the dusty volcanic wasteland to its former fertile state. It was the first tentative step towards the reclamation of all the Darklands. However, although they had had notable successes in these regions, generally their progress was painfully slow and both parties were resigned to the fact that their efforts to undo the damage caused by the Darklords would take not years but centuries to complete.</p>
<p>In the far west, the Drakkarim had retreated to their homelands and were engaged in a bloody war against the Lencians. Much of Nyras had been reclaimed by the armies of King Sarnac, the Lencian commander, and his flag now flew over a land which, two thousand years ago, had once been part of Lencia.</p>
<p>Following the destruction of the Darklords of Helgedad, the Giaks, the most prolific in number of all of Gnaag’s troops, fled into the Darklands and sought refuge in the gigantic city-fortresses of Nadgazad, Aarnak, Gournen, and Kaag. Within each of these hellish strongholds there exists now a state of frenzied civil war as remnants of the Xaghash (lesser Darklords) and the Nadziranim (evil practitioners of Right-handed magic who once aided individual Darklord masters) fight for control. By virtue of their geographic locations, and the struggles taking place within them, each of these city-fortresses is isolated from the next and poses no immediate threat to the peoples of the Free Kingdoms. It is widely believed that by the time the Elder Magi and the Herbalish reach the walls of these strongholds the occupants will have long since brought about their own extinction.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, throughout Northern Magnamund, peace reigns victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the age of the Darklords has finally come to an end. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>
<p>Often, over the past two years, Lord Rimoah has warned you to be wary of one such group. They are known as the Cener Druids and they occupy a small forested realm to the south of the Stornlands called Ruel, which they have made virtually impregnable to invasion through the use of evil herbcraft. Once, long ago, after the defeat of Naar’s greatest champion—Agarash the Damned—they were used by Naar as agents of revenge. Then they formulated and released a plague that decimated the Elder Magi and left the way open for their conquest of Magnamund. Now the Elder Magi fear that, as before, Naar will use them again to enact revenge for the defeat of his champions. They fear that they will seek to destroy the Second Order of the Kai before it becomes too strong, for your quest for mastery of the Grand Master Disciplines has opened a door to such goodly power that even Naar himself may be unable to counter it. Unless he closes that door, others of your kind could soon be following in your footsteps.</p>
<p>Already the Elder Magi have petitioned the courts of all the Freeland rulers, beseeching them to act immediately and destroy the Cenerese before it is too late. Many of the kingdoms they have visited unwittingly harboured secret sects of Cener Druids who practised their vile herbcraft, often in remote areas. Sommerlund was one such land. Only a year ago, a sect of Cenerese was found in the foothills of the Durncrags engaging in blood rituals at a site less than a day’s ride from the Kai Monastery. News of this prompted action which brought about a scourge of the Lastlands and forced many Cenerese sects to flee to the safety of Ruel. The regular armies of three nations—Palmyrion, Lourden, and Slovia—are now encamped around its border in an attempt to contain the Cener threat. They remain watchful, but that is all they can hope to do. The Cenerese are too powerful within their own domain for the Freeland armies to dare launch an invasion. One such attempt has already ended in disaster. Six months ago an allied force numbering seven thousand men entered the Forest of Ruel, intent on storming the Cenerese fortress of Mogaruith and razing it to the ground. Seven thousand men went into the forest; only seventy returned alive.</p>
<p>Despite the vigilance of the three Freeland armies, the containment of the Cenerese threat within Ruel has not been entirely successful. To the south, the Cenerese can enter and leave their realm by means of tunnels which honeycomb the Skardos Mountains. These secret passages emerge in the free state of Caron, at the northern edge of the Rootstrangle Swamp which, in due course, drains into the Tentarias (the great waterway which divides the northern and southern continents of Magnamund). Once access to the Tentarias has been achieved, the Cenerese are virtually free to sail to any port or country of their choosing. Caron is helpless to prevent the Cenerese from using this route through their land. They are a poor nation with few resources, and the Rootstrangle Swamp is one of the most difficult places to patrol. It comprises a constantly shifting morass of mud flats and rotting vegetation, inhabited only by Tzargs—a carnivorous race of frog-like animals originally bred by the Cenerese for the sole purpose of guiding them through the swamp’s ever-shifting channels.</p>
<p>On midsummer’s day, Lord Rimoah arrived at the monastery without, as was customary on such occasions, any forewarning of his visit. His unexpected appearance surprised the other Kai and caused them to speculate in whispers about the reasons for his journey. Yet his coming was of no surprise to you. For days you had experienced a feeling of unease, a presentiment that your orderly life at the monastery was about to undergo a dramatic change. Rimoah brought with him a glass phial of pale green liquid, a liquid that was proof-positive that the Cenerese were indeed preparing to enact Naar’s revenge upon the Free Kingdoms of Magnamund.</p>
<p>The phial had been found among the possessions of a Cener Druid who had been caught in the city of Ragadorn after having been followed there by a watchful Herbwarden from Bautar. Under interrogation, the Cener revealed that he had been sent to Ragadorn by Arch Druid Cadak, the ruler of Ruel, to distribute the phials of this liquid to agents sympathetic to the Cenerese cause. The Herbwarden had sent the phial to Dessi where the Elder Magi, upon analysing the liquid, discovered it to be a powerful vaccine against a new and complex plague virus. Judging by the composition of the vaccine, this plague virus would prove to be several times more lethal than the Great Plague which had so devastated their race thousands of years ago. The Cener succeeded in taking his own life before he revealed further details, but, judging from the evidence in their possession, the Elder Magi were convinced that the Cenerese are getting ready to unleash an airborne plague virus that could kill all the living creatures of Magnamund, save those that had ingested the vaccine.</p>
<p>Rimoah informs you that the Elder Magi are unable to replicate the vaccine in huge quantities, and even if they were so able, to distribute it to every living creature on Magnamund would be an impossible task.</p>
<p>‘The Herbwardens are sure that the Cener they found in Ragadorn was one of the first of those sent out of Mogaruith to distribute this vaccine,’ said Rimoah, his voice uncharacteristically sombre. ‘Therefore we must act quickly if we are to destroy the virus before Cadak is ready to release it into the atmosphere. Someone must enter Mogaruith. They must find and destroy the plague virus, and they must ensure that this evil work can never again be resumed.’</p>
<p>For a long moment you stood in silence staring into Rimoah’s unblinking eyes. Then, with a nod of your head, you acknowledged what had to be done. Only a Kai Grand Master possesses the skills and experience that would be essential to the success of this vital mission…and there is only one Kai Grand Master.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>For five years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you begin your first Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 31). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1–12), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to Book 13. These scores may include Lore-circle bonuses. You may also benefit from the Disciplines that you’ve mastered (e.g. Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses).<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the Grand Master series. You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over to the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Book 13 onwards):</p>
<ul>
<li>Crystal Star Pendant</li>
<li>Sommerswerd</li>
<li>Silver Helm</li>
<li>Dagger of Vashna</li>
<li>Silver Bracers</li>
<li>Jewelled Mace</li>
<li>Silver Bow of Duadon</li>
<li>Helshezag</li>
<li>Kagonite Chainmail</li>
<li>Korlinium Scabbard</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Grand Master Disciplines</a></h3>

<h4><a name="mksumary">Kai &amp; Magnakai Disciplines</a></h4>

<p>During your distinguished rise to the rank of Kai Grand Master you have become proficient in all of the basic Kai and Magnakai Disciplines.

</dl>
<p>Now, through the pursuit of your new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the Gods Kai and Ishir go with you as you begin your brave and noble quest.</p>
<p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered four of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat with one of your Grand Weaponmastery weapons, you add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Defender, with which you begin the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, means you are supremely efficient in the use of <em>two</em> of the weapons listed below. For each book that you complete in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13–20), you will gain mastery of an additional weapon. For example, if you complete <cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite> and have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery at the beginning of the next <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> book, you may choose an additional Weapon to gain mastery of.</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Short Sword</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>Quarterstaff</li>
<li>Broadsword</li>
<li>Axe</li>
<li>Sword</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 to any number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.<sup><a href="#discplnz-1-foot" name="discplnz-1">2</a></sup></p>
<h4><a name="anmlmstr">Animal Mastery</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.</p>
<h4><a name="deliver">Deliverance (Advanced Curing)</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, whilst in combat, their <small>ENDURANCE</small> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. This ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
<h4><a name="assimila">Assimilance (Advanced Invisibility)</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of a few days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques that make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.</p>
<h4><a name="hntmstry">Grand Huntmastery</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and have greatly heightened senses of touch and taste. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p>
<h4><a name="pthmnshp">Grand Pathsmanship</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by hostile plants and have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.</p>
<h4><a name="kaisurge">Kai-surge</a></h4>

<p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, Grand Masters need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. When using the weaker psychic attack—Mindblast—they may add 4 points without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. (Kai-surge, Psi-surge, and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.)</p>
<p>Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>
<h4><a name="kaiscrn">Kai-screen</a></h4>

<p>In psychic combat, Grand Masters are able to construct mind fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increase as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h4><a name="nexus">Grand Nexus</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to withstand contact with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h4><a name="gnosis">Telegnosis (Advanced Divination)</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Grand Master to spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far fewer ill effects. Duration and the protection of his inanimate body increase as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h4><a name="magi">Magi-magic</a></h4>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lord Rimoah, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of battle-magic, as taught to the Vakeros—the native warriors of Dessi. These skills include the basic use of Old Kingdom Spells such as <i>Shield</i>, <i>Power Word</i>, and <i>Invisible Fist</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.</p>
<h4><a name="alchemy">Kai-alchemy</a></h4>

<p>Under the tutelage of Guildmaster Banedon, you have mastered the elementary spells of Left-handed magic, as practised by the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells include <i>Lightning Hand</i>, <i>Levitation</i>, and <i>Mind Charm</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Left-handed magic increase, enabling you to craft new Kai weapons and artefacts.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in this, the first of the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="../lw/14tcok.htm#title">Book 14</a>.</p>
<p>For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original four disciplines you begin with, you may add 1 point to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> score and 2 points to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline, your original four Grand Master Disciplines, and any Special Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> adventure, which is called <a href="../lw/14tcok.htm#title"><cite>The Captives of Kaag</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you leave the monastery and begin your long journey to the land of Palmyrion, you take with you a <a href="#map">map of the Dark Realm of Ruel</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed any of the previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1–12), you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. Fifty Crowns is the maximum you carry, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your monastery.</p>
<p>You can take five items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess from previous adventures (remember, you are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry a maximum of ten Backpack Items).</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bow (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows: record them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>

</li>
<li>Spear (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>List the five items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the appropriate headings, and make a note of any effect they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You do not need to make notes, but you should refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>

<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is two. Weapons aid you in combat.

<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is strongly recommended that you also equip yourself with a close combat weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 27) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving him a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 35.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Doomwolf pack’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +5. (35–30 = +5). +5 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +5. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge).</li>
<li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may evade only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, you will gain an additional Grand Master Discipline and progress towards the pinnacle of Kai perfection—to become a Kai Supreme Master.</p>

<li>Kai Supreme Master</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="imprvdsc">Improved Grand Master Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Kai Grand Mastery, you will find that your Disciplines will steadily improve. For example, if you possess the Discipline of Grand Nexus when you reach the Grand Master rank of Grand Thane, you will be able to pass freely through Shadow Gates and explore the nether realms of Aon and the Daziarn Plane.</p>
<p>The nature of these additional improvements and how they affect your Grand Master Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Grand Master Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Grand Master’s Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your mission to enter the Cenerese stronghold of Mogaruith and destroy the deadly plague virus will be fraught with deadly danger. Be wary and on your guard at all times, for the inhabitants of Ruel are sworn enemies of the Gods Kai and Ishir.</p>
<p>Some of the things that you will find during your mission will be of use to you in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all, so try to be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>Choose your four Grand Master Disciplines with care, for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores may be. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this first Grand Master adventure.</p>
<p>The prevention of the spread of a deadly Cenerese plague virus, and the subsequent deaths of untold millions, depends on the success of your mission. May the light of Kai and Ishir be your guide as you venture into the darkness of Ruel.</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>‘Grand Master…the quest must begin without delay for time is not our ally,’ says Lord Rimoah, as he paces nervously back and forth across the flagstoned floor of your monastery chamber. You voice your agreement and call upon your wise friend to counsel you as best he can about the mission you have undertaken. Not entirely to your surprise, you learn that he has already made preparation, confident in the knowledge that you would agree to this dangerous quest. He has arranged for you to travel to the Freeland of Palmyrion where a guide is waiting to escort you to Ruel. The guide can guarantee safe passage to the borders of the dark realm, but no further.</p>
<p>Rimoah tells you that little is known of Ruel, save that the unnatural forest which surrounds and protects the Cenerese stronghold of Mogaruith harbours creatures that are the stuff of nightmares. Some almost defy description. The poor wretches who survived the last ill-conceived, ill-fated invasion of Ruel, spoke of their encounters with gigantic, acid-spitting worms that rose up out of the ground without warning and devoured whole regiments of their comrades at a single stroke. They told also of the battles that were waged against ferocious packs of disease-ridden rat-creatures they called ‘Vazhag’. The Cenerese breed these sentient vermin in warrens deep below Mogaruith, and then release them into the forest to patrol and gather food for even viler abominations that rarely venture beyond the walls of their stronghold.</p>
<p>‘Truly I wish that I were able to tell you more, Lone Wolf, but so little is known of Ruel. It is a dark and sinister place. Yet, there is something else, something that I can give you which will aid your quest,’ says Rimoah, and he holds out his hand. In his palm is the phial of green liquid, the vaccine that will, at least, protect you from the plague which threatens to destroy so much of your beloved world. You take it, uncork it, and then quickly swallow the bitter contents. Unexpectedly your stomach rebels and a wave of nausea rises up which makes you slap a hand over your mouth. A few moments later the nausea fades and you are able to remove your hand and speak.</p>
<p>‘How long will it protect me?’ you ask, queasily.</p>
<p>Rimoah smiles. ‘Oh, I’m sure you will be safe for some considerable time, Lone Wolf. I’m afraid I forgot to mention that the phial contained a concentrated vaccine, more than sufficient to protect a hundred men!’</p>
<p>Within the space of a few short hours you are ready to begin your long journey south to Palmyrion. Having entrusted the monastery to the care of your Kai Masters, you and Lord Rimoah leave by means of a secret tunnel, one of several that you have had constructed to enable you to enter and leave the monastery unobserved. You emerge in a clearing at the heart of the Fryelund Forest, at a place where Guildmaster Banedon is waiting patiently to welcome you aboard <cite>Skyrider</cite>, his flying ship. Here you take time to bid farewell to Lord Rimoah, who will await your return at the monastery, before climbing aboard and placing yourself in the charge of your old friend Banedon.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>You wrench yourself free from the creature’s grip and stagger towards the antechamber, but Cadak is not prepared to allow you to escape from his creation so easily. From the tip of his staff there erupts a stream of thorny vines that wrap themselves around you and bury their barbs deep into your flesh: lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. You struggle desperately to break your cruel bonds as Exterminus closes in for the kill.</p>

<p>The knife’s tip draws a crimson line across your left shoulder before it hits the wall and rebounds with a metallic <i>clang</i>: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>The Vazhag, its confidence boosted by the wounds it has caused you, draws another knife and comes waddling across the chamber, screeching maniacally. Raising your weapon you turn to face your foe as it launches its desperate attack.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>With a thin, gurgling scream, the Cener clutches at his fatal wounds and slides slowly down the cavern wall. As he crumples on the floor, he raises his hand and, in a last defiant gesture, he lunges out to scratch at your leg. You step back and avoid the sharp, cat-like claws which have suddenly sprouted from the tips of his gloved fingers, and these poisoned barbs eject their venom harmlessly upon the dusty floor.</p>
<p>Once you are sure that the druid is no longer alive, curiosity prompts you to prise away his green mask and look upon the face of this servant of evil. It is an ugly, disease-pocked face, human in shape yet lacking any trace of humanity.</p>
<p>Before leaving the cavern you decide to search him and his Vazhag escorts, and you discover the following items:</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Cener Robe (If kept, this item will occupy 2 spaces in your Backpack)</li>
<li>Cener Mask</li>
<li>16 Lune (equivalent to 4 Gold Crowns)</li>
<li>Sword</li>

<h3><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>The warrior clasps his wounds and exhales his last breath as he tumbles lifelessly to the floor. Standing over his still body you use the tip of your weapon to prise open the visor of his iron helmet. You reveal the brutal features of a Drakkar, one who had survived the downfall of the Darklords and had counted himself fortunate to have found refuge here in Mogaruith. Sadly for him he had not reckoned on ever crossing your path.</p>
<p>You conceal the bodies of the Drakkar and his hound as best you can before pulling the portal closed and continuing your exploration of Mogaruith.</p>

<h3><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>A sudden rush of pain and nausea makes you drop to your knees (lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), leaving you shivering fitfully. Your psychic Magnakai Disciplines were insufficient to protect you against the physical effects of the powerful mind probe which you have just experienced, but they were at least able to shield your true identity.</p>
<p>The light, reflected from the Cener Mask you are wearing, activates a sensor and as you rise to your feet you see the great metal door begin to slide open.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect150">Turn to 150</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>You focus your power upon the scuttling horde and try to bring them under your control. They do not respond to your commands and, at once, you sense that they are under a spell that has robbed them of all free will. You draw on your inner strength and attempt to break this spell, and the creatures cease their frenzied movement with an abruptness you find unnerving; it is as if they have suddenly turned to stone. Now that you can see them clearly they remind you of beetles, save that they are far larger and have long, rat-like tails. You observe them for a few moments longer, and then take a tentative step forwards. Instantly they burst into life, only this time they do not confine themselves to the forest floor.</p>
<p>With a sound like a thousand squeaky door hinges, they sprout wings and soar into the air in a formation which resembles a small black cloud. Soon they have left the clearing, and as you watch the last of them disappear over the tops of the trees, you can only hope that they are not some form of lookout employed by the Cenerese.</p>
<p>On the far side of the clearing you discover that the trail continues deeper into the forest. You follow it for nearly an hour until your keen senses warn of danger ahead and immediately you halt in your tracks. You hear a movement: it is above and behind you. With incredible speed you spin on your heel and raise your weapon to parry a possible attack. Your reactions are fast, but they may not be quick enough to protect you from what lurks in the canopy of branches high above.</p>
<p>From out of the darkness there falls a wriggling mass of thorny creepers that come snaking towards your head as if driven by a single mind.</p>

<h3><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>Quickly you crouch down and take cover beside the staircase, hidden from view by the shadows and your Kai camouflage skills. Within seconds the Vazhag appear, but they are not alone. They are being led by a frog-like Tzarg which they have tethered on a chain. The Tzarg has its face pressed close to the steps and it is snuffling and snorting like a bloodhound as it tries to locate your scent.</p>

<h3><a name="sect9">9</a></h3>

<p>Trusting to your Magnakai skill of Invisibility, you leave your hiding place and attempt to slip past the wagon and its struggling escort.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you have Grand Mastery of Assimilance, add 3 to the number you have chosen.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 5 or less, <a href="#sect181">turn to 181</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 6 or more, <a href="#sect59">turn to 59</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect10">10</a></h3>

<p>Warily you follow the track into the deepening gloom, your senses alive to the evil that permeates every root and branch of this forbidding forest. As darkness closes in there arises from out of the mire a mist, grey-green and sickly, which smothers the ground. Its corpse-like chill leaves you shivering, despite all your efforts to shield yourself from its clammy touch.</p>
<p>Night no longer restricts your vision and, as the track ascends towards a wooded peak, you see the outline of a ruined stone watchtower perched atop a rocky knoll. You sense that the tower is deserted and, keen to escape from the mist, you climb towards a crack in its granite base. You crouch to enter the jagged breach and, in doing so, you disturb a host of crab-creatures nesting within. In a frenzy they scuttle away from the tower, disappearing among the surrounding rocks in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Aching with fatigue, and mindful of the perils which still lie ahead, you settle yourself into a corner of the rubble-strewn tower and try to snatch a few hours of sleep. This night your slumber is disturbed by strange and unwholesome dreams, formed from the fears suppressed by your conscious mind. You are haunted by phantom shapes which take the form of friends and fellow countrymen. Kai initiates under your tutorage and simple Sommlending folk, their heads bowed and their faces pitted and disfigured by plague, drift past you in a seemingly endless procession.</p>
<p>You awake with a start, your pulse racing and your forehead glistening with beads of sweat. At first a sense of hopelessness washes over you, brought on by the vivid memory of your nightmare but, as your consciousness returns, so too does your inner strength. You perceive the dreams as a warning of what will happen should your quest fail, and this realization strengthens your resolve to reach Mogaruith and thwart the Ceners’ evil plan.</p>
<p>You have slept for several hours and, physically at least, you feel refreshed (restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). In the half-light of early morning you gather together your equipment and weapons in readiness to resume your perilous journey to Mogaruith.</p>

<h3><a name="sect11">11</a></h3>

<p>The sound of scraping metal and rattling chains echoes in your ears as you fell the creature with a deadly blow to the base of its skull. As it falls from its stool, you spin around, weapon in hand, and the first thing you see is the knife-like glint of fangs. From a semicircular hole in the wall a pack of war-dogs come charging into the hall, their jaws agape and their claws scrabbling on the shiny flagstones as they race towards the desk. You raise your weapon confidently and brace yourself in readiness to meet their attack.</p>

<p>The columns of armoured rat-men pay little attention to you, but your undead charge does elicit squeals of disgust from some as you draw closer to their mighty stronghold.</p>
<p>Walking across the age-blackened drawbridge towards the spiky arched tower of Mogaruith is an unnerving experience. It is as if you are walking along a blackened tongue towards the gaping throat of some gigantic dragon. On either side the bubbling moat releases foul fumes which fill your nostrils with a terrible sugary stench that clogs your lungs and blurs your vision. You draw upon your Magnakai skills and your vision clears, but the sight which lies ahead looks no more inviting than it did before.</p>
<p>At the tower you are challenged by a troop of Vazhag guards who regard your companion with a distaste that is all too obvious. Using your Magnakai Disciplines of Animal Control and Pathsmanship to aid your deception, you inform them that you have come from the south on urgent business. They demand to know your name and why you have charge of an undead human. You try to bluff them but you notice that the zombie’s presence is beginning to attract the unwanted interest of other Vazhag guards.</p>
<p>One of the rat-men pushes his snout to within inches of your mask and says, to your surprise, that you can enter Mogaruith so long as you first register your arrival. He points to a door in the tower wall and asks you to enter it. ‘There,’ he says, ‘you can make your registration.’</p>
<p>Immediately your Magnakai sense of Divination warns that the Vazhag is lying; a prison cell awaits you beyond that door.</p>

<p>As you strike the blow that brings one of the fearsome monsters crashing lifelessly to the ground, you spring away from its gore-stained carcass and barge shoulder-first through the line of screeching ghouls. The spectacle of the fallen Giganite, and the suddenness of your action, has taken the creatures by surprise. Before they can react you have already sprinted to within a few yards of the leafy tunnel.</p>
<p>You glance over your shoulder to see the shambling horde falling over themselves in their haste to give chase. The sight raises your spirits but the sensation is short-lived, for above them towers a Giganite, its mouth full of bubbling phlegm. With a flick of its powerful neck it sends the massive spit-ball arcing towards your fleeing form.</p>
<p>Instinctively you throw yourself to the ground and the foul missile whooshes past, hitting a tree at the base of its trunk. At once there is a sizzling sound and, with a creaking groan, the tree is brought crashing to the ground, its base eaten clean away by the acidic saliva. Great droplets of the spittle splash your tunic and instantly it begins to smoulder.</p>

<p>With ease, you sidestep and dodge your way through the throng of hungry Vazhag, and escape undetected into the empty passage which lies beyond the iron portal. A few minutes later, as you are exploring this new tunnel, you hear the squealing cease as the great door closes with a rumbling boom.</p>
<p>The passage continues eastwards for several miles and, with the exception of an occasional Vazhag sentry, it is virtually deserted. At length you arrive at the entrance to another hall smaller than the lava-cavern but equally as crowded. Daylight streams into this hall through a large archway guarded by armoured Vazhag, and pairs of horny-skinned war-dogs which they hold on the leash. Beyond the archway you can see a track that disappears towards a distant ridge of hills.</p>
<p>Directly above the archway, you notice a thin ray of sunlight streaming through a window-like hole in the rock. Sorely aware that the main entrance is so heavily guarded that it will be very difficult, even for someone as gifted as yourself, to escape that way undetected, you resolve instead to escape by means of the smaller opening in the rock wall.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="x-cenerese">‘Szalista,’</i> you say, the ancient Cenerese word meaning ‘fifteen’, and immediately you hear the door’s locking mechanism disengage itself.<sup><a href="#sect15-1-foot" name="sect15-1">3</a></sup> There is a hiss of escaping air and the heavy portal swings slowly inwards on massive hinges.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, you step through the doorway and enter the circular tunnel beyond.</p>

<h3><a name="sect16">16</a></h3>

<p>The passage descends steeply and the foul air becomes thick with a gritty dust which clogs your eyes and nostrils. Although the pitch blackness does not hamper your vision, the air has become so saturated with dust that you now have difficulty seeing more than a few feet in front of your outstretched hands. Slowly you advance, trusting to your Magnakai skills to protect you from choking as you seek a clearer section of the passage.</p>
<p>After a while you notice long streamers of greasy yellow moss hanging from cracks in the tunnel roof. Between them are spread festering fungi of varying hues, all cankerous and vile to the eye. You are passing beneath these growths when suddenly, as if triggered by a silent command, they burst open and shower you with great clouds of sticky, mote-like spores.</p>
<p>At once your body senses that the spores are highly poisonous and, as a subconscious reflex, your Magnakai Curing skills activate and counter the deadly toxins that have found their way into your lungs. Your chest is wracked with pain but you sustain no serious injury: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>The sticky, foul-smelling spore cloud is so thick that you have difficulty moving forwards. It feels as if you are wading through a tunnel of mud. Your Kai skills have neutralized the poisonous spores, but there is now hardly any air left to breathe. Fear wells up in your stomach as you feel your strength beginning to ebb.</p>

<h3><a name="sect18">18</a></h3>

<p>As your killing blow severs the creature’s body, the two halves explode, scattering shards of mummified remains all around the chamber. The force knocks you backwards and, as you fall, you catch a glimpse of a wispy, ghost-like shadow, rising towards the ceiling. It halts for a moment in mid-air, and then it seeps through the solid stone ceiling like smoke through a veil.</p>
<p>Before leaving the chamber you pause to search the stone casket. Inside you discover a few mouldering rags and a Copper Key (if you wish to keep this Key, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item).</p>
<p>Cursing your ill luck, you leave the chamber and head towards the laboratory door. On the other side of it you discover a series of narrow passages which eventually end at an antechamber. This domed chamber is decorated with tapestries which depict Cenerese legends, ignoble and infamous deeds that were perpetrated during the Age of the Old Kingdoms, when, for nearly a thousand years, the Cenerese tyrannized Northern Magnamund.</p>
<p>A single heavy oaken door in the opposite wall offers the only exit from the antechamber. As you approach it, you notice that it is slightly ajar. Suddenly you hear the doleful sound of chanting emanating from beyond this door. Curiosity prompts you to peer through its narrow opening and, as you do so, a chill runs the length of your spine when you see what lies beyond.</p>

<h3><a name="sect19">19</a></h3>

<p>You look down to see that a leafy vine is spiralling upwards around your leg. You summon your powers to repel the plant but your commands appear to have no effect. Then the fearful realization hits you that this is not a vine at all: it is the limb of a bog creature.</p>
<p>You attack and sever the plant-like tendril, but immediately there is another, and then another. With the speed of striking snakes they ensnare your legs and wrench you into the morass. You fight desperately to free yourself as you are dragged deeper into the foul-smelling mire. Repeatedly you strike out below the surface in the hope of dealing your attacker a mortal wound. You feel something burst upon your weapon’s tip and, momentarily, the creature’s grip falters, but only to recover with renewed strength and tenacity.</p>
<p>Then sharp pain lances through your thighs as row upon row of barbed claws spring out from the unseen creature’s tendrils and puncture your skin. You scream in agony and your cry is echoed from beneath the surface of the muddy pool by the sound of a malicious bubbling laugh.</p>

<p>As you strike the blow that seals this creature’s doom, it vents a fearful high-pitched shriek that instantly silences the cave-beasts and sends them scurrying for the shadows of their filthy cells.</p>
<p>Within the blink of an eye the ghostly Pechdrazil evaporates in the air, leaving nothing to mark its existence save the harsh metallic odour of ozone. You wipe your sweat-laden brow with the back of your left hand and glance over your shoulder at the cowering creatures, huddled in their cells. Casually you sheathe your weapon and step forward to stare down the staircase into the gloom below. You focus upon the darkness, but you are unable to discern where the staircase ends.</p>

<h3><a name="sect21">21</a></h3>

<p>At the top of the stairs you find a dining chamber in disarray. Piles of rubbish are strewn across its tiled floor, gnawed bones cover its tables, and the remains of a small fire are still smouldering at its centre.</p>
<p>An arched portal in the far wall offers hope of escape into a corridor beyond and you hurry towards it. As you are running across the room, you notice a pile of discarded weapons lying beside a bench. Among the weapons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Sword</li>
<li>Broadsword</li>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>4 Arrows</li>

<p>The torrent of flaming oil hits you in the face and a wave of pain forces you to your knees. Instinctively you call upon your Magnakai skill of Nexus to extinguish the flames and, within seconds, the oily fire gutters and dies: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>The Cener had begun to cackle gleefully, so sure was he that you were doomed. Now his cruel laughter chokes in his throat as, numbly, he fumbles for a weapon to halt your approach. He draws a curvy-bladed knife from a hidden sheath and holds it out unsteadily in front of his chest. You tell him to drop the dagger but he is deaf to your command. He feints a swipe then lunges for your heart, yet you deflect this weak attack with your right forearm and counter it with a left hook to the chin which shatters the druid’s glassy green mask. He reels backwards and crashes to the floor, his bony fingers scrabbling at his throat. For a moment he writhes around on the dusty ground; then his body stiffens and he lies completely still. Cautiously you step nearer, expecting trickery. Then you see that a shattered fragment of his mask has severed his jugular vein and you know that he no longer poses a threat to your life.</p>

<p>Swiftly you search the drawers of the dead creature’s desk, sifting through papers and ledgers for clues as to where in Mogaruith the plague virus is being cultivated. The papers yield no useful information, but you do find two small levers set into the desk’s surface.</p>
<p>You examine them closely and your Kai senses reveal that they operate the two metal doors to this antechamber. You flip the right-hand lever and the door by which you entered glides shut. Then you pause for a moment to prepare yourself before flipping the left lever, for this will open the door which leads to Cadak’s throne room.</p>

<p>The Pit Agarashi gives a deafening howl as your killing blow ruptures its black heart. Its powerful body stiffens and its red eyes become opaque, like two orbs of frosted crimson glass. For a moment it remains fixed and immobile; then its claws release their grip upon the rock wall and the beast plummets backwards to crash heavily upon the hard pit floor.</p>
<p>Breathless with exertion, you sheathe your weapon and force yourself towards the surface, eager to escape lest someone, or something, should come to investigate the creature’s death-cry.</p>

<p>With a foul, snickering cry the Vazhag swarm into the derelict hut. You sidestep into a corner to prevent them from getting behind you, and then raise your weapon in readiness to meet their attack. The leading rat-men throw themselves upon you in a blood-crazed frenzy, hacking and stabbing with their rusty blades, yet you dispatch them in seconds with such precision and economy of movement that it would appear to an onlooker that you had hardly moved at all.</p>
<p>But for every Vazhag that falls, three more take its place, and within minutes you are in danger of being suffocated to death by the press of their loathsome bodies.</p>

<p>You speak your answer several times but nothing happens.<sup><a href="#sect26-1-foot" name="sect26-1">4</a></sup> You are convinced that your answer is correct and, in frustration, you tap the box on the table repeatedly in the hope of releasing the lid. On the third tap a razor-sharp blade springs from the side and cuts into the palm of your hand: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Cursing the device, you fling it away into a corner and attend to your injured hand. A sudden shuffling noise, somewhere in another part of the library, causes you to freeze: someone else has entered. You look over your shoulder at the door and decide that now would be a very wise time to leave.</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs you find a corridor which heads off towards the west before turning sharply towards the north. As you approach the corner you skid to a halt: your senses are warning you of approaching danger. Hurriedly you unsheathe your weapon, but no sooner is it out of its scabbard than a Drakkarim warrior comes running around the corner and crashes straight into you, knocking you both sprawling to the ground.</p>
<p>Quickly you recover but not in time to retrieve your weapon before the Drakkar attacks.</p>

<h3><a name="sect28">28</a></h3>

<p>Feeling unsettled by your close encounter with the deadly acid-spitting tunnel crabs, you unsheathe your weapon and descend the staircase with renewed caution. Sixty steps later you arrive at a small cavern where three tunnels converge, from the north, the south, and the west.</p>
<p>There are many tracks on the dusty floor and your Magnakai hunting skills enable you to read them with ease. They are confined to the west and south tunnels and, judging by their size and depth, they were made by large rat-like creatures, but ones that walk upright, like humans. From what you have been told about the denizens of Ruel, you are sure that these tracks were made by Vazhag, the warrior vermin bred by the Cenerese.</p>
<p>Among their tracks you note others that are far from rat-like. You are about to examine these a little closer when suddenly you hear the sounds of movement echoing from the west tunnel; a group of creatures are approaching. At once you abandon your tracking and look around for somewhere to hide.</p>

<p>As the Acolyte’s body falls limply to the platform, you sheathe your weapon and take hold of the ladder which ascends to the winch. All eyes in the hall below are watching your ascent and, when they suddenly realize what it is you are trying to do, pandemonium breaks out. Hysterical screams of anger and fear merge into a dreadful cacophony which fills the hall with clamouring echoes. You glance down at their faces, contorted by rage, and as you do so you glimpse a new threat to your safety.</p>
<p>A handful of Vazhag archers are scurrying out of the portal which connects Cadak’s chamber to the gallery. They spread out along the parapet and begin firing at you with their lacquered bows. Black-fletched arrows whistle past on either side, their barbed heads passing dangerously close to your legs and feet.</p>

<h3><a name="sect30">30</a></h3>

<p>With trepidation you approach the door, fully aware that you are walking into a trap. Spear-wielding Vazhag hover on either side, alert and suspicious, their tarnished weapons held in readiness to strike should you show any sign of resistance.</p>
<p>A cell awaits you beyond the door. It seems to be no more than what you expected to find and, as the heavy door is slammed shut, you begin immediately to search for a means of escape before the Vazhag guards return.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite its plain appearance, this cell is far more than you expected it to be. It is an extermination chamber, one of several located throughout Mogaruith. It is designed for the speedy destruction of those who would dare to challenge the Cenerese.</p>
<p>Suddenly a powerful electrical current is fed into the metal floor and you are transfixed as the deadly voltage courses through your body. You fight with all your strength to survive this terrible onslaught but the current is irresistible and, eventually, your body can take no more.</p>
<p class="deadend">Sadly, your life and your quest end here in Mogaruith.</p>

<h3><a name="sect31">31</a></h3>

<p>You send your Arrow whistling towards the creature’s throat. A fatal wound looks certain until, at the very last moment, the beast twists aside to avoid the oncoming shaft and, with a dull <i>thunk</i>, the Arrow skewers its shoulder. The creature roars with pain but the injury does not deter it from attacking. With the knife-wielding Vazhag close behind, it quickly recovers and together they rush forward to attack.</p>

<p>The track crosses the plateau and passes within a few yards of the pits before continuing into a tunnel-like gap in the trees beyond. You advance, but every step that brings you nearer to the site causes your senses to rebel. The sensation of evil is so strong here that it clogs your nostrils and makes you struggle for breath. You resolve to run towards the gap but a sudden noise from behind arrests you in mid-step.</p>
<p>Shambling out of the forest come a horde of monstrous shapes, corpse-like beings that exist in a twilight between life and death. Perched atop their withered bodies are hairless heads bearing lidless, red eyes and gaping maws, rimmed with hundreds of needle-thin fangs. As one they utter a deathly groan and you feel an icy chill electrify your spine.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration II]</div>
<p>Fighting to suppress your mounting horror, you turn and run towards the gap. You are within a few yards of the rocky spur when a dozen or more of these fearful creatures appear from the shadows to block your escape. Once more they utter their cadaverous cry and advance upon you from both sides.</p>
<p>Desperately you survey the plateau for another means of escape, but there is none: you are trapped. The only choice you have is to face the creatures or retreat towards the pits.</p>

<p>The tapestry depicts a ghastly feast, a banquet attended by demonic creatures who are gorging themselves on human remains. Seated at the head of this unholy feasting table is a bull-like creature who possesses the head and face of a man. From between his bloodstained lips there protrude two fangs, needle-sharp and gleaming. From his seat he looks down upon his loathsome guests with a sneering contempt.</p>

<p>Silently you crawl through the foliage to a position close by the busy trail. Twenty minutes later you see a wagon approaching and, as it nears your hiding place, you focus your Magnakai powers of Nexus at one of the front wheels, causing it to jam. The ghorkas grunt in protest as the wheel locks and the wagon veers off the track.</p>
<p>Cursing and squealing, the Vazhag driver jumps down and begins to hammer at the wheel with the butt of its spear, whilst his three wounded companions struggle to quieten the startled ghorkas. Under cover of the confusion, you slip around to the rear of the wagon, using your camouflage skills to minimize the risk of being seen.</p>

<p>You press yourself into a hollow in the north tunnel wall and wait with bated breath as the sound of the approaching group grows louder and nearer. Torchlight flickers, casting a watery yellow beam across the cavern floor; then the first of the group enters and you catch sight of their repulsive forms. A patrol of six Vazhag files into the cavern. Each one is as tall as a Sommlending youth and all are armed with crude, rusty weapons. Fragments of armour and uniforms, which once belonged to human soldiers, encase their hairy, rat-like bodies. They are more than twenty feet away from your hiding place, but even so, they give off such a vile aroma of filth and disease that you are forced to draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to prevent yourself from retching out loud.</p>
<p>They halt at the foot of the stone stairs and communicate with each other in a high-pitched squeal which reminds you of rusty door hinges, and repeatedly they cast furtive glances along the west tunnel as if they were waiting for another of their party to catch up. Within minutes, another member of their patrol does arrive, only this creature is not one of their breed: it is human-sized. However, the hooded scarlet robe it is wearing makes it difficult for you to be absolutely sure that the creature within is human.</p>
<p>The Vazhag cease their squealing when the hooded one raises a gloved hand and motions to the south tunnel. For an instant, you catch a glimpse of the glassy green mask that is covering his face, and at once you recognize this mask: it is a <i xml:lang="x-cenerese">jazak</i>, the ritual mask of a Cener Druid.</p>

<p>As you slay the last war-dog, a host of squealing Vazhag come pouring into the hall; your pursuers have caught up with you at last. Having chased you for over five miles, the screaming rat-men want only to rend you limb from limb, yet the unexpected sight of the slain war-dogs heaped about your feet immediately cools their bloodlust. Any warrior who could defeat half a dozen of these hellish creatures deserves to be treated with some respect!</p>
<p>You hear them muttering; then, from among their ranks comes one dressed in contrast to its brethren, cloaked completely in a brown hooded robe. It pulls from a pocket a sphere of glass which is filled with a speckled swirling vapour and, with a curse, it hurls this fragile sphere at your feet.</p>

<p>Before you stretches a cavernous hall, lit by the glow from fire-filled orbs hanging by chains from the ceiling. Facing each other are two rows of stone statues which form a grotesque corridor leading to an archway on the far side. Although they are human in shape, extreme expressions of pain and despair twist and contort their faces.</p>
<p>You advance cautiously. You are wary of the statues and your body is tensed to react should they show the slightest hint of animation. Fortunately your caution is unnecessary and you are able to reach the archway and leave the hall without further incident. A short passage leads to a junction where a wider corridor crosses from left to right. Your skin prickles in reaction to the concentration of evil you detect in this subterranean part of Mogaruith, and silently you call upon your creator, the noble God Kai, for protection and guidance before continuing.</p>
<p>Instinct prompts you to turn left, and within a few minutes you arrive at a chamber where a vast staircase of black marble ascends to many levels, lost in the gloom above. Opposite this grand staircase stands a large door, carved from a solid sheet of strange green metal, the like of which you have never seen before. It gives off a pulsating radiance which washes over the empty chamber, illuminating symbols carved into the walls and floor. You focus on these symbols and, in a chilling moment of realization, you decipher their meaning.</p>

<p>The two rat-men have only just finished their meal when a group of Vazhag, accompanied by a red-robed Cener Druid, enter the cave through an archway on the far side of the lake. The Cener directs the Vazhag to man a large capstan-like device and, as they work this creaking hoist, slowly the drawbridge begins to descend. The moment it is fully lowered the druid and his escort come shuffling across the bridge in single file. They are about halfway over when there is a bubbling rush of water and the surface of the lake begins to seethe, as if it is boiling. A sudden fear grips the Vazhag. They freeze in their tracks, twitching and squealing fitfully as they stare aghast at the frothing water. Then the Cener screams at them to retreat and they scurry back the way they came, with the two you saw earlier close on their heels.</p>
<p>The first ones to make it back scamper to the capstan and begin to reverse it as quickly as they can. You see the bridge-ropes tighten and, with a tortured creak, the heavy wooden bridge rises off the platform. Fearing that you could be left stranded on the wrong side of the lake, you rush forward and leap for the underside of the rising drawbridge.</p>
<p>Like a limpet you fix yourself to its damp timbers as the bridge approaches the vertical. However, before the bridge is fully retracted, the Vazhag abandon the capstan and flee through the archway, unaware that you are clinging to the underside of the bridge. For a moment you are relieved that the rat-men and their druidic master have disappeared, for you had not relished the thought of them discovering you in such a vulnerable situation. Unfortunately, your relief is short-lived, for within seconds of their disappearance you find yourself face-to-face with the object of their terror.</p>

<p>You scream in pain as an arrow skewers your left wrist. The agony of the wound and the shock of the arrow’s impact cause you to lose your grip and, in a terrifying instant, you fall from the chain and plummet headlong towards the floor of the hall below. Death is mercifully swift.</p>
<p>Your incredible bravery has brought about the destruction of the plague virus, and the druids who knew the secrets of its cultivation. This destruction has saved millions from a terrible death, and the selfless courage you displayed in bringing this about will never be forgotten by the free peoples of Magnamund. Sadly, though, death is the price you have paid for your victory.</p>

<p>Even though your Bow and Quiver are covered by your druid’s robe, you retrieve them and are ready to fire at the fleeing Vazhag before either has taken a dozen paces.

<p>Your swift dispatching of the Vazhag has gone undetected and, anxious that it remains so, you rush forward to drag their bodies away into the undergrowth. Within minutes the task is complete.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you still have to find a way of entering Mogaruith. Yet, as you return to the trail, you are struck by a bold idea. Calmly you approach the zombie, who has remained stationary throughout the incident, and stoop to retrieve the poor creature’s chain. Then, with pounding heart you turn and slowly walk along the trail towards the crowded drawbridge.</p>

<p>Mindful of the insidious effect of these books you search as quickly as you can. On one of the lower shelves you notice an ornately carved wooden box, banded with gold and inlaid with precious gemstones. You carry it to the main table where the light is brightest and, as you place it there, you hear a riddle emanating from a design engraved on its lid. It speaks in the Cenerese tongue but you instantly recognize the words:</p>

<p>Through the wide opening in the chamber wall there is a gallery which overlooks a vast windowless hall. You approach the gallery’s railed parapet and stare down at a score of druids who are working at tiled tables positioned in rows across the floor. Upon some tables rest porcelain troughs filled with oily fluids which seethe beneath a constant shower of electrical sparks. Other tables support dozens of glass boxes of differing sizes. The smallest contain rats; the largest contain horses. Hundreds of pipes and tubes run around the walls, feeding a supply of fluids and gases to the experiment tables. The fumes rising from this diabolical laboratory sting your eyes, but you ignore the discomfort and continue your observations, eager to take in every detail of the evil work which is taking place below. It is not long before you recognize that this hall is where the deadly plague virus and its vaccine are being produced.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration III]</div>
<p>You know that you must act with all haste for Arch Druid Cadak is still alive and, wherever he is at present, you can be sure he is plotting to capture or kill you, probably both. Below lies that which you have come here to destroy. But how will you accomplish your task? Relentlessly the seconds tick by as you try to formulate a plan. Then you see something which sparks an idea. The pipes that feed fluids to the laboratory’s disposal tanks are connected to a massive cauldron suspended from the ceiling by a winch and chains. You focus upon a plaque fixed to the side of this great vat and magnify your vision until you can read what has been engraved upon it. With grim satisfaction you read the words: ‘Danger—Concentrated Acid’.</p>
<p>Here is the key to the destruction of the virus. If you can cause the cauldron to tilt over far enough it will discharge its contents into the hall below, flooding the virus-laden tables with thousands of gallons of concentrated acid.</p>
<p>Elated by your daring plan, you look for a way to reach the winch which controls the angle at which the cauldron hangs from the ceiling. It is positioned high upon a platform atop an iron gantry, which is accessible only by ladder. Fortunately this ladder begins on the far side of the gallery.</p>
<p>Confident in your purpose you hurry around the gallery towards the ladder. You are within twenty paces when suddenly the harsh <i>clang</i> of an alarm bell fills the hall. You have been seen.</p>

<p>Swiftly you swim away from the bridge towards the east wall of the cave. You can see no obvious exit here, but twenty feet below the surface you notice that the crevasse appears to undercut the cave wall.</p>
<p>Suddenly a spear splashes into the lake and passes within inches of your head, causing you to dive deeper to avoid the others that are sure to follow. In the icy gloom you sense an undercurrent of warmer water rising from the crevasse. Also, your super-keen eyesight detects a pale light radiating from the base of the cave wall. Another cavern must lie beyond this one, but you have no way of knowing for sure just how far away that cave might be.</p>
<p>Mustering your Kai courage, you swim down towards the crevasse and propel yourself along an oval-shaped tunnel below the east cave wall. In the distance you see the pale glow and you strike out towards it, thankful that at least this watery passage does not harbour hostile creatures.</p>

<p>Forewarned, you resist this attack just long enough to raise your weapon and strike a mighty blow which tears away a great swath of the creature’s wriggling limbs.

Once more the remaining tendrils seek you out, but this time they are no longer soft and fibrous, but stiff and studded with barbed thorns.</p>

<p>The library contains thousands of books and time-yellowed parchments, stacked in uneven rows upon shelves that line every wall. The air is heavy with their odour and your senses prickle with the sensation that you are in the presence of works of great evil.

<p>At length they finish their studies and rise from the table. As Monad restores the book to its shelf, Noraa says:</p>

<p>Your advanced Sixth Sense alerts you to danger. At the end of the tunnel you feel the presence of several creatures, some of which you know to be Vazhag. They are a noisy crowd although the sounds they are making are not particularly hostile. Their voices echo strongly, giving you the impression that the creatures are occupying a large and spacious location.</p>

<h3><a name="sect68">68</a></h3>

<p>Using your Magnakai skill of Psi-surge, you focus your power at a Vazhag guard who is standing on top of the wagon, and release a stunning burst of psychic energy aimed at its brain. Immediately, the creature grasps its head between its paws and lets out an ear-splitting squeal of pain as your attack sears its nervous system. The sudden cry freezes the surrounding rat-men and, when the victim of your attack tumbles from the rear of the wagon, they surge forward, eager to find out what is wrong. In the ensuing confusion, you leave your hiding place and attempt to escape unseen through the portal.</p>

<p>Your weapon glances off the creature’s head, opening a wound which kills it instantly. But the force of the impact is not enough to prevent its hand from reaching the button.

<p>The Vazhag pushes his snout to within an inch of your face and says, to your surprise, that you can enter Mogaruith so long as you first register your arrival. He points to a door in the tower wall and requests you to enter it. ‘There,’ he says, ‘is where you can make your registration.’</p>
<p>Immediately your Magnakai sense of Divination warns that the Vazhag is lying; nothing but a prison cell awaits you beyond that door.</p>

<p>You grit your teeth and fix your eyes on the observation platform as you wait for the chain to reach the end of its arc. Upon the instant the momentum stops, you release your grip and hurtle through the air towards the platform’s rail. You have timed your jump to perfection. You skim the rail and land on the metal floor, roll over to lessen the impact, and then spring to your feet and run towards the inviting darkness of the doorway which services this platform.</p>

<p>You struggle to extricate yourself from the bodies of the Vazhag you have slain. As you rise to the summit of the grisly heap, you glimpse the Cener Druid scurrying towards the gap in the trees by which he, and his late minions, entered the clearing.</p>
<p>You know that he must not be allowed to escape. If he were to reach Mogaruith and raise the alarm, your mission, and probably your life, would soon be over.</p>

<p>Exterminus is no more than an arm’s length from you when you manage to tear free of your thorny bonds. With cat-like grace you duck below the creature’s outstretched hands and drive your weapon deep into its unprotected belly. It screams in agony and reels backwards to crash down upon the table which stands beside Cadak’s black chair. The awesome bulk of the creature’s body crushes the table to matchwood and breaks open the crystal sphere that rested upon it. Immediately there is a loud boom and a tremendous rush of putrid air knocks you down. A funnel of darkness engulfs the body of Exterminus and, with stunning suddenness, there is silence. Both the creature and the shattered remnants of the sphere have vanished completely.</p>
<p>You stagger to your feet and turn to face the Arch Druid. The shock of what he has witnessed has left him open-mouthed and drained of colour. He is mumbling incoherently and trembling with fear. You take up your weapon and advance towards him, determined to rid Magnamund of this evil druid once and for all, but the sight of you drawing closer snaps him out of his trauma and galvanizes him into action. He weaves his hands before his face and, in an instant, he is shrouded in a cocoon of light. You strike out at the light but your weapon passes clean through it, meeting with no resistance. Then the light fades and you are left standing alone in the druid’s empty throne room.</p>

<p>The stairs lead to another hall on a level fifty feet higher. Here, two staircases ascend to the left and right, and a gloomy tunnel disappears directly ahead of you. Your senses pick up something moving at the end of the tunnel and, when you focus your infravision along this dark passageway, you see another Vazhag patrol heading straight towards you. This one is being led by two Acolytes of Vashna and a pack of Ruel war-dogs.</p>
<p>Eager to evade these enemies, you glance at both staircases and try to decide which one to climb.</p>

<p>The sphere explodes on impact and you are engulfed by a cloud of sickly grey gas. At once you feel your throat tighten and your stomach churn as deadly bacteria-infested vapour penetrates your lungs. But, within seconds, your powerful defences destroy this bacteria and you recover enough to be able to run towards the entrance, hidden by the billowing gas.</p>
<p>In the ensuing chaos, you escape through the entrance unchallenged. For a moment you are blinded by the early morning sunlight which illuminates the surrounding hills, but, as you stumble along the trail which leads away from the caverns, your vision clears and you see a vast expanse of forest away to the east. This sea of sickly grey-green trees radiates an unmistakable aura of evil that immediately identifies it as the Forest of Ruel.</p>
<p>Your escape is not pursued and, after a few minutes, you stop among a cluster of boulders in order to catch your breath. The surrounding land appears deserted, the only unusual feature being the track which wends its way eastward through the hills towards a gap at the edge of the unwelcoming forest. You consult your <a href="#map">map</a> and conclude that this is the Skardos Trail, the secret route used by the Ceners which leads all the way to Mogaruith itself.

<p>Before you stretches a cavernous hall, lit by the glow from fire-filled orbs hanging by chains from the ceiling. Facing each other are two rows of stone statues which form a grotesque corridor leading to an archway on the far side. A flicker of fear chills your heart when you notice that the expressions frozen upon their misshapen faces are those of pain and despair.</p>
<p>Cautiously you advance. You are wary of the statues and your body is tensed to react should they show the slightest hint of animation. Then you detect something which makes you freeze in mid-step. Your Kai senses warn you that something is sleeping in a shadowy alcove close to the distant archway. Anxious not to disturb whatever is resting there, you call upon your camouflage skills to mask your presence before moving any nearer.</p>

<p>You follow the tunnel for many miles as it plunges deep into the bowels of the Skardos Mountains. At length you reach a wider, smooth-walled corridor, which bears recent tracks upon its dusty floor. Your infallible Magnakai skills of Pathsmanship reveal that this corridor leads due west, towards Mogaruith.</p>
<p>The numerous tracks tell you that this passage is frequently used. Judging by their size and depth, they have been made by large, rat-like creatures, but ones who walk upright, like humans. From what you have been told about the denizens of Ruel, you are sure that these are the tracks of Vazhag, warrior vermin bred by the Cenerese. Among them you note other tracks that are far from rat-like.</p>
<p>Cautiously, you follow the corridor and, despite your mounting fears, you encounter nothing more threatening than a nest of ragged-winged bats and an occasional rock snake, which slithers away at your approach. Gradually, the air becomes increasingly cooler and more humid. You can smell the strong scent of water somewhere in the distance and you are not at all surprised when, as you round a sharp bend, you see shimmering reflections playing upon the smooth stone ceiling ahead.</p>

<p>In desperation you draw upon your reserves of psychic strength to shape a ball of energy, and then you hurl it at the nearest abomination. It strikes its subconscious and the beast’s eyes shut tight in pain as the force of your mind-strike bites deep into its unshielded cortex.</p>
<p>The attack is successful; the creature is wounded and it slithers back into the safety of its pit. Yet, despite seeing what has befallen their brother, the remaining two creatures continue to advance undaunted.</p>

<p>You raise your hood and draw your Kai cloak close about your shoulders before pressing yourself flat against the dusty tunnel wall. The shadows and your camouflage skills mask you completely; it is as if you have suddenly vanished. When the two groups of Vazhag come together, close to where you are hiding, they immediately blame each other for having allowed you to escape. They argue loudly and a fight looks imminent until the timely arrival of a Vazhag elder cools their flaring tempers. He orders them back to the lava-lit cavern, and you wait calmly for the grumbling rat-men to disperse before continuing eastwards, along a now-empty tunnel.</p>
<p>For nearly five miles you explore and, with the exception of an occasional Vazhag sentry, the tunnel remains virtually deserted. At length you arrive at the entrance to another hall, smaller than the lava-cavern but equally as crowded. Daylight streams into this hall through a large archway guarded by armoured Vazhag, and pairs of horny-skinned war-dogs which they hold on the leash. Beyond the archway you can see a track that disappears towards a distant ridge of hills.</p>
<p>Directly above the archway, you notice a thin ray of sunlight streaming through a window-like hole in the rock. Sorely aware that the main entrance is so heavily guarded that it will be very difficult, even for someone as gifted as yourself, to escape that way undetected, you resolve instead to escape by means of the smaller opening in the rock wall.</p>

<p>Anxious to reach the surface as quickly as you can, you leap over the bodies and stride up the stairs. You are hungry and while you run you must eat a meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery).</p>

<p>Using your innate Magnakai skill of Invisibility, you take care to mask your body heat and scent lest they should stir the curiosity of any keen-nosed denizens of Ruel. Then, with caution guiding your every step, you advance through the knee-high grasses towards the fallen tree. As you approach, you focus your powers of Divination and scan the surrounding darkness for invisible or hidden enemies. Sensing no immediate threat, you continue to the forest’s edge where you are greeted by an unwholesome warmth. It rises out of a mulch of insects and fungi that are feasting upon the corpse of the tree. Silently you offer up a prayer to Ishir before venturing a step further into this inhospitable domain.</p>
<p>Beyond the dead tree you find a muddy track which is bordered on both sides by the tall trunks and thorny briars of the forest. So dense is this tangle of trees and brush that it is impossible to leave the track. You feel as if you are walking along an endless passage, one so unnatural that its construction could only be the result of evil herbcraft.</p>
<p>At length the track widens and the trees begin to thin out. Ahead you see a clearing and at once your senses tingle: it is a warning that you are not alone. Instinctively you reach for your weapon and, as your hand closes upon it, you see that the floor of the clearing is alive with a carpet of loathsome scuttling creatures. At once you attempt to use your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to determine if these creatures are hostile, but your efforts go unrewarded.</p>

<p>There is a slight gradient to the tunnel and, gradually, as the stone floor ascends, you feel a draught of warm air wafting gently in your face. It feels comfortable and yet it is far from welcoming for the air is sticky and humid, as if the breath of some great jungle beast was being exhaled along the passageway.</p>
<p>In the distance you hear a fire-like roar, and another sound—squeaking—which forewarns you that Vazhag lie ahead. You advance, masked by your Magnakai skills, and step forth into a massive chamber which is lit by the fierce light of volcanic fire. From a crater-like pit at the chamber’s centre, a jet of red-gold flame roars up to a towering height, and clouds of steam fill the cavernous roof space where it plays upon a ceiling of damp rock. Around the pit are constructed several small, domed huts, all made of volcanic clinker scavenged from the crater’s edge. The huts house a colony of Vazhag; you count more than fifty females and their young scurrying around the crude dwellings and estimate that at least that number again could be sheltering inside.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration V]</div>
<p>Using your skills, and the advantage of the flickering shadows which dance upon the rough cavern walls, you circle around the settlement unseen. On the far side there is an onion-shaped archway guarded by six Vazhag males, all of whom are heavily armed and armoured. You move a little closer, confident that your natural abilities will get you past these oversized spear-toting rodents unnoticed, but you are brought to a halt by a daunting sight. A few feet beyond the archway stands a massive portal, a wall of solid black iron.</p>

Early morning sunlight illuminates the surrounding hills, and beyond them you see a vast expanse of forest, a sea of sickly grey-green trees, which radiates an unmistakable aura of evil. The position of the sun and your Pathsmanship skills inform you that you are now looking upon the Forest of Ruel from the eastern foothills of the Skardos Mountains.</p>

<p>Slowly you recover from the trauma and pull yourself to your feet. Ahead, the track crosses the plateau and passes within a few yards of the pits before continuing into a tunnel-like gap in the trees beyond. You advance, but every step that brings you nearer to the site causes your psychic senses to rebel. The images you saw, and the aura of evil that lingers here, are so strong that you find it difficult to step closer. You resolve to reach the gap at a run but a sudden noise from behind arrests you in mid-step.</p>
<p>Shambling out of the forest come a horde of monstrous shapes, corpse-like beings that exist in a twilight between life and death. Perched atop their withered bodies are hairless heads bearing lidless, red eyes and gaping maws, rimmed with hundreds of needle-thin fangs.

You are within a few yards of the rocky spur when a dozen or more of these fearful creatures appear from the shadows to block your escape.

<p>From the darkened doorway you watch the activity taking place in the keep, hoping to see something that will help you locate where in Mogaruith the Cenerese are producing their deadly plague viruses.</p>
<p>From out of the milling crowds of Vazhag there suddenly appears a small group of red-robed Cener Druids. They are talking to each other as they walk towards your hiding place.</p>
<p>Quickly you pull away from the open doorway and retreat deeper into the building. A narrow corridor takes you to a flight of steps which descends to where a passage crosses your path. An ornately painted sign, written in Cenerese, indicates what may be found at the end of each passage.</p>

<p>Your Arrow clips the druid’s arm but it fails to stop him from making his hasty escape along the forest track. Cursing your ill luck, you run across the clearing and give chase.</p>
<p>You have been on his trail for less than a mile when you sense danger ahead. The druid has managed to reach another patrolling pack of Vazhag, much larger than his own escort, this one led by six of the druid’s brethren. He informs them of your presence and, using their corrupted form of herbcraft, they cause the undergrowth to close in upon you and hold you prisoner. Marshalling all your skills, you manage to cut your way free of its grip, but not before the druids have mustered reinforcements from Mogaruith.</p>
<p class="deadend">They attack you mercilessly with the full might of their evil craft. Courageously, you defy them, but their combined power is far greater than even a Grand Master can withstand. With the name of your gods and your country on your lips, you finally meet your doom here in the Forest of Ruel.</p>

<p>You reach the top of the ladder and haul yourself onto the winch platform. Now the whistling shafts strike and splinter uselessly against the underside of this metal floor which hides you from the archers’ view.</p>
<p>You run to the winch and examine the gears and chains, trying at once to understand their workings and find a way to cause the cauldron to discharge its corrosive contents into the hall below. But the device is designed to prevent the chance of this occurring. The only way you can make the cauldron spill its deadly load is by severing a thick metal pin which secures the heavy chain to its rim.</p>
<p>Anxiously you glance over the edge of the platform at the confusion raging in the hall below. Three druids, having recognized your intentions, are trying desperately to gather together virus samples from their cultivation vats. The vats are fixed to the tables, triple-sealed with protective glass to prevent accidental leaks, and it is precisely this elaborate protection which now confounds the druids’ frantic efforts to save their plague cultures.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of your eye you notice that the first of the Vazhag archers is now climbing the ladder to the winch platform, and you know you must act swiftly and effectively if you are to fulfil your quest.</p>

<p>It takes you half an hour to reach the foot of the staircase. There awaits a dank cavern, its uneven floor littered with the bones of creatures who fell from the stairs or were consumed by the spectral being which once commanded this vault. Steeling yourself against the unwelcoming gloom, you advance along an oval, white-walled passageway of mineral rock and emerge in another chamber which is filled by a deep pool of crystal-clear water.</p>
<p>At first it appears to be a dead end; then you notice a faint light reflecting upon the surface of the water and you look up to see a hollow directly above. It is a natural chimney which rises into the ceiling, and at its end you see a warm, yellow, lantern-like glow. The chimney is rough and pitted, and to someone of your experience it is as easy to climb as a wide-stepped ladder.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes you reach the neck of the chimney and find yourself staring through a hole at the floor of a passageway beyond. The source of the light comes from several oil lamps which hang at regular intervals from the roof of this narrow tunnel. You can sense the presence of Vazhag somewhere in the vicinity, and so you choose to wait here in case a patrol is about to pass this way.</p>

<p>The presence here of two worshippers of Vashna, who was once the greatest of all the Darklords, rekindles chilling memories of past encounters with these fanatics. Following the downfall of the Darklords you had assumed that the last remnants of the sect had vanished forever, yet here before you are two who still wear their robes and practise their vile necromantic art.</p>

<p>From out of a swirling mist there comes into focus a moving scene that is terrible to behold. A vast procession of partially-clad soldiers are being herded into the pits by packs of blood-hungry Vazhag. They are bound with ropes and many are grievously wounded. They plead for mercy but their pitiful cries go unheeded as the snarling, savage rat-men stab them to death with their cruelly-fashioned spears before casting them down into the three yawning abysses.</p>

<p>Hanging on to the underside of the descending drawbridge by your fingertips, you are slowly lowered into the icy cold waters of the lake. The bridge stops with a jolt, leaving you dangling waist-deep in the water and feeling all-too-vulnerably like a piece of Dholdaarg bait.</p>
<p>You hear the rasp of clawed feet scurrying across the bridge and a voice, unmistakably Cenerese, echoes from the opposite side of the cave. Despite the pain in your fingers and forearms, you remain absolutely motionless as the rat-like Vazhag cross the bridge and descend to the muddy shore. One or two remain on the bridge directly above you, and you can see them through the cracks in the timbers. They are squeaking and pointing at the oily green pools of blood that stain the surface of the lake.</p>

<p>A narrow corridor lies beyond, lit by a gloomy crimson light which is filtering through a threadbare curtain hung from hooks in the ceiling. Automatically you cast your eyes around, checking floor, walls, and roof for traps, but detect nothing unduly suspicious. Then you approach the curtain and through its moth-eaten fabric you spy a small bed chamber. A grossly overweight Vazhag, wrapped in furs, lies sprawled upon a divan in the centre of the room. He is snoring fitfully. Around him are strewn heaps of all manner of items: rusty weapons, tarnished armour, boxes, and candlesticks, trinkets, baubles, and books. In the merchant stores of Holmgard they would be rejected as worthless junk, but here, in the rat-holes of the Skardos Mountains, they no doubt pass for treasure.</p>

<p>With the shrieks of the horde and the rasping growl of the Giganite echoing in your ears, you spring to your feet and run headlong into the mouth of the leafy tunnel. Your stamina and fleetness of foot keep you ahead of the ghouls until, two miles later, you sense that the danger has passed and it is safe enough for a few minutes’ rest.</p>
<p>Once your pulse has settled, your fear of being followed prompts you to continue along the leafy passage without further delay. You progress in a near-darkness which is broken only by a few scattered rays of grey light that creep through the ceiling above. At length the tunnel ends and you emerge into a clearing where stand the derelict remains of an ancient stone dwelling. You approach it warily, sensing the presence of magic, yet inside its shattered walls you find nothing but mould and clumps of sickly black grass. Then your skills of Divination tingle afresh as the presentiment of sorcery increases. Suddenly you realize that the source of the magic is not here in this ruined hut: it is approaching the hut.</p>
<p>Through a crack in the stones you see a gap appear in the wall of trees opposite and a group of Vazhag enter the clearing, their ratty faces sniffing at the heavy, humid air. Among their number is one who is not of their breed. He is human in size and stature, though his hooded scarlet robes make it difficult to be sure. For a moment you catch a glimpse of the glassy green mask covering his face and at once you know that this being is a Cener Druid. In his hand he carries a rod of gold that is radiating the aura of magic which you detected when first you entered the clearing.</p>
<p>The Cener calls his pack to a halt. They cease all movement and watch in quiet awe as he raises his golden rod and uses it to make a slow, deliberate sweep of the clearing. Hurriedly you draw on your Magnakai skills of Invisibility and Pathsmanship to shield you from detection as the Cener sweeps back the rod and levels it directly at the derelict hut.</p>

<p>The tunnel continues for more than a mile before it descends, by means of a steep staircase, to another passageway over one hundred feet below the first. Here the air is full of fine dust and you can hear small scratching sounds coming from inside the walls.</p>
<p>In the dark distance, you see clearly a score of crab-like creatures grouped in circles on the tunnel floor. Their shells are bone-white and you hazard a guess that these strange crustaceans have probably never been exposed to the sun. At your approach they scuttle up the walls with surprising speed and disappear into funnel-shaped holes that riddle the ceiling.</p>
<p>Confident that the crabs have taken fright and fled, you advance along the tunnel towards another staircase, the top of which you can just discern in the far distance. You are passing beneath the crab-holes when you hear a faint hissing noise and suddenly you feel droplets of sticky clear liquid spattering your head and shoulders. Then wisps of grey smoke arise from your cloak and you feel a searing pain, as if a fistful of red-hot needles were being stabbed repeatedly into your scalp.

<p>Waiting in the shadows, camouflaged from detection by your cloak of Kai skills, you patiently observe the portal and guards. After several minutes, the resonant boom of a metal gong echoes in some deep and distant part of the caves. As the echo slowly fades, another sound, that of metal scraping on stone, resounds around the cavern. Then a crack of light appears along the bottom of the portal and, with a grating screech, the great wall of iron slowly rises up into the ceiling.</p>
<p>Through the opening comes a patrol of Vazhag who are escorting a wagon stacked high with wooden boxes, barrels, and sacks. A sudden rush of female Vazhag, all squealing and clamouring for food, brings the wagon to a halt directly beneath the onion-shaped portico. The escort struggles to fend off the hungry females with little effect until, with a spine-tingling screech, the portal begins to descend. A wave of panic washes over the Vazhag and they turn and run back into the cavern, fearful of being crushed beneath the falling iron door.</p>

<p>Coughing and retching, you haul your way out of the stinking bog and collapse upon the soft forest floor. For a few moments you lie there, unable to see through the mask of filth that hangs down in front of your eyes. Then, with the edge of your hand, you slowly scrape the slime from your face and look back at the threads of dark crimson blood which trace a marbled pattern against the green surface scum. They are testimony to your hard-won fight.</p>
<p>With the memory of your battle against the bog creature still vivid in your mind, you clamber to your feet and hurry along the track heading east.</p>

<p>Anxious to avoid being seen by the approaching Vazhag, you release your grip and allow yourself to drop silently into the lake. The moment the cold waters close above your head you strike out and swim underwater towards the north bank. The lake is dark and forbidding yet your powerful sight enables you to see the contours of the lake bed as they pass beneath you.</p>
<p>For the most part the water is no more than twenty feet deep, hardly a depth capable of hiding the huge body of a Dholdaarg. But as you are nearing the centre you catch sight of the monster’s lair. A yawning black crevasse cuts a jagged line east to west along the bottom of the lake bed. A strong undercurrent and an inky blackness tell you that this watery abyss could be several hundred feet deep.</p>
<p>You increase your stroke and swim across the crevasse as swiftly as you can, fearful of what lurks in its hellish depths. Like an underwater cliff’s edge the lake bed reappears, and beyond it you glimpse the inviting shallows of the north bank.</p>

<p>Using your Magnakai power of Nexus, and the strength of your own two hands, you force open the barred door and gain access to the anteroom beyond. It is unlit and every surface is thick with a dust that has lain undisturbed for many years. On a marble dais, which occupies most of the floor, there stands a large rectangular stone casket. It has no lid, and as you approach it you see that it contains the mummified remains of a creature you cannot readily identify.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VIII]</div>
<p>You can feel no evil in the vicinity of this corpse, and your senses tell you that there is nothing, other than yourself, alive in this room. Confident in this knowledge you lean forward to examine the corpse.</p>
<p>Without warning, a powerful spike of psychic energy penetrates deep into your mind. Its icy cold attack numbs your senses and leaves you trembling helplessly with shock—lose 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Reeling from the unexpected onslaught, you struggle to erect a mind shield as the mummified remains of the corpse slowly stir into life.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a claw-tipped limb snakes towards your throat and grabs you in a choking, vice-tight grip. Desperately you struggle to unsheathe a weapon and free yourself as the grisly remains of a Plague Agarashi rise up from the casket only inches before your disbelieving eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above you, there is a loud rattling noise followed by the grating squeal of iron on stone. You spin around to look at the staircase by which you entered and, to your horror, you see a heavy portcullis come crashing down to seal off the exit.

<p>The Acolytes gasp in shocked surprise as you rise up to confront them eye to eye. The nearest allows his spear to waver and instantly you lash out at his vulnerable chest. The impact of your blow knocks him from the platform to fall, screaming, into the midst of the glass boxes on an experiment table far below.</p>
<p>Gracefully you step onto the platform and crouch in readiness to fight the remaining Acolyte. He meets your stare with a sneer that readily conveys his hatred of your race.

<p>The speed and apparent ease with which you dispatched his minions shocks the Cener Druid to the core. Gibbering with fright, he turns and runs for the safety of the tunnel by which he and his now deceased underlings entered the cave. Anxious not to allow him to escape and raise the alarm, you clamber onto the platform and run across the drawbridge in pursuit of the red-robed figure.</p>
<p>The tunnel beyond the bridge is narrow yet well-lit and you have no difficulty following your prey. Stealthily and speedily you close upon him like a lion running to ground a frightened fawn. He glances over his shoulder repeatedly as you draw nearer; then, in desperation, he skids to a halt beneath one of the many hanging bowls which illuminate the passageway. He raises both hands, as if surrendering, but as you approach him he grasps the underside of the heavy bowl and heaves it at you. Suddenly, with a sizzling rush, a gallon of blazing coal oil spills over the stone rim and comes gushing down towards your unprotected face.</p>

<p>Stunned and groaning, the Cener fumbles for his slender golden rod and, as if guided by more than chance, his spindly fingers locate it at once. Yet, before he can use it to retaliate, you sprint across the clearing, weapon in hand, and attack him where he lies:</p>

Two are armed with spears and they face you on foot, but the third sits astride a captured Slovian steed. It is wielding a cavalry lance and you can tell by the way the rat-man balances it that it is skilled in its use.</p>

<p>The grim horde shambles nearer and close ranks, in readiness, perhaps, for a concerted attack. But combat is not their intent. As one, they open their mouths and give vent to a ghastly sound that is akin to mocking laughter, the like of which you have never heard before.</p>
<p>As if in answer to their gleeful cacophony there arises, from out of the black shadows of the pits, a dreadful rumbling roar. Something huge is stirring deep within each of those dark forbidding shafts. As the ghoulish laughter reaches its pitch, three giant, misshapen cat-like heads rise up into the light, each perched atop a snaky body as thick as the trunk of a tree. They bare their fangs and shake off the tangle of human bones that cling to their stinking, corpse-green manes.</p>
<p>The sight of these unholy creatures makes you reel back in shock and utter a cry of disbelief. Your cry is lost among the barrage of screeching howls, yet the cat-things react as if they hear it and, together, they come oozing out from their dark, noisome lairs and glide slowly towards where you stand.</p>

One in particular catches your eye and, although you try hard to ignore it, you find you cannot turn your head away. It shows a pit of helpless humans, writhing and screaming in anguish as they are slowly consumed by packs of wild-eyed plague dogs. The scene shocks you deeply for the doomed humans all have distinct Sommlending features.</p>
<p>With difficulty you tear your eyes away and force yourself to look elsewhere in this unfriendly hall. You see columns rising to the roof, each wound round with creepers and fungi which give off an unwholesome, pallid light. Ahead you see another door, identical to that by which you have entered, and before it there stands a desk on top of a plinth of green stone. A creature sits at the desk, huddled over the open pages of a ledger upon which it is writing with a feathered quill pen. As you draw closer it stops scrawling and places its quill into a nearby pot of ink, fashioned from the crown of a human skull.

<p>You hide yourself as best you can, taking advantage of a brace of boulders that lie beside the stone steps, and wait with bated breath as the sound of the approaching group grows louder and nearer. Torchlight flickers, casting a watery yellow beam across the cavern floor; then the first of the group enters and you catch sight of their repulsive forms.</p>
<p>A patrol of six Vazhag files into the cavern. Each one is as tall as a Sommlending youth and all are armed with crude, rusty weapons. Fragments of armour and uniforms, which once belonged to human soldiers, encase their hairy, rat-like bodies. They are more than ten feet from your hiding place, but even so, they give off such a vile aroma of filth and disease that you are forced to draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to prevent yourself from retching out loud.</p>
<p>They come closer and halt at the foot of the stone stairs, barely an arm’s length from where you are hiding, and you hear them talking in a high-pitched squeal which reminds you of rusty door hinges. All the while they repeatedly cast furtive glances at the west tunnel entrance as if they are waiting for another of their party to catch up.</p>
<p>Within minutes another member of their patrol does arrive, only this creature is not one of their breed: it is human-sized. However, the hooded scarlet robe it is wearing makes it difficult for you to be absolutely sure that the creature within is human. The Vazhag cease their squealing when the hooded one raises a gloved hand. In that instant, you catch a glimpse of the glassy green mask which is covering his face, and at once you recognize this mask: it is a <i xml:lang="x-cenerese">jazak</i>, the ritual mask of a Cener Druid.</p>

<p>Cautiously you advance to the edge of the stagnant pool, your super-sharp senses alert to the slightest hint of danger. Using your innate Magnakai skill of Invisibility you take care to mask your body heat and scent least they should stir the unwanted attentions of any keen-nosed denizens of Ruel. You pause at the pool’s edge for a moment where, using your powers of Divination, you scan the surrounding darkness for invisible or hidden enemies. Sensing no threat, you continue to skirt the fetid pond and follow the stream to where it trickles out of the forest. There you are greeted by an unwholesome warmth. It rises from a decaying mulch of roots and fungi that squelch repulsively underfoot. Silently you offer up a prayer to Ishir before venturing further into this inhospitable domain.</p>
<p>For several miles you trudge through the slime that borders the stream. This sickly strip of mud forms a narrow pathway that is, in turn, bordered by the tall trunks and thorny briars of the forest. So dense is this tangle of trees and brush that you feel sure it could only be the result of evil herbcraft.</p>
<p>At length the stream widens and the forest begins to thin out. Soon you are able to leave the foul-smelling brook and enter the forest proper, where after a short while you happen upon the remnants of a track. It descends towards a bog from which arises a cloak of misty vapour. Warily you approach, for the fog clings to the morass and masks its dangers.</p>

<p>Immediately, with an angry roar, the dog-creature springs forward with its taloned paws outstretched. You retreat, discarding your Bow in favour of a hand weapon with which to fight this ravenous beast.</p>

<p>A narrow corridor connects the chamber to another, where there stands an imposing door made of sheeted copper, inlaid with a filigree of gold and silver. It is the only exit from this otherwise drab chamber.</p>
<p>A closer inspection of the door reveals that it is surrounded by an airtight seal. Furthermore, there is no keyhole, bolt, or handle. However, your keen eyesight is drawn to a pattern in the door’s centre panel which, thanks to past experience, you recognize to be a sophisticated combination lock.</p>
<p>The gold inlays form three rows of three numbers within a grid of silver lines:</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><th colspan="3" scope="colgroup">Number grid</th></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>6</td></tr></table>

<p>A hellish noise echoes around the clearing, a terrifying whip-like crack that sets your ears ringing. From the tip of the Cener’s rod there has erupted a stream of crackling blue light. It arcs towards the dwelling and comes bursting through the blocks of ancient stone, ripping them asunder as if they were no more substantial than bales of mildewed corn. Sharp slivers of stone pepper your legs, and the blast’s concussion leaves you wide-eyed and gasping for breath: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Through the smoking hole in the wall you can see that the Vazhag pack have halted in their tracks. They hold their grimy paws to their ears and grimace as the Cener prepares to launch a second blast of power from his golden rod.</p>

<h3><a name="sect160">160</a></h3>

<p>You decide that to travel openly along the track would be too risky. Rather than chance falling foul of a Vazhag patrol, you set off through the forest, using the trees for cover, but all the while keeping the trail in sight as you trek northeastwards toward the Cenerese stronghold.</p>
<p>Your decision is soon justified. Within a few minutes you are forced to hide when a rickety wagon, laden with casks and escorted by a dozen Vazhag, appears on the trail ahead. Unaware of your presence, the detachment passes within yards of your position before continuing on its way southwards.</p>
<p>It is an hour past noon when the trees thin out and you catch your first glimpse of Mogaruith. Crouching at the forest’s edge, you stare awestricken by the sight of its slime-green walls and towers. This vast Cenerese fortress, rising out of the land like the thrusting fist of some vile volcanic demon, bristles with formidable defences. Turrets and bastions punctuate its sheer stone walls, and its base is ringed by a moat of bubbling water. A single drawbridge spans this moat, providing sole access to an archway lined with iron spikes, which gives the entrance a monstrous appearance, like that of a gigantic fanged maw.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration X]</div>
<p>Two muddy tracks lead away from the drawbridge. One is the Skardos Trail, the track that brought you here, and the other heads due east. You consult your <a href="#map">map</a> and discover that it leads to the River Storn, less than five miles distant. There a bridge spans this mighty waterway, connecting Ruel to the realm of Slovia. A small army of Vazhag, accompanied by a host of other creatures of doubtful origin, are marching away from Mogaruith in a column. Judging by their numbers, and the wagonloads of equipment they trundle in their wake, you suspect that they are marching to battle with the Freeland army of Slovia.</p>
<p>In order to destroy the plague virus and fulfil your vital quest, you know you must gain entry to this stronghold. Anxiously you let the minutes pass as you scan the interminable lines of marching Vazhag, and the fortress walls, in the hope of spotting a means by which you could enter Mogaruith undetected.</p>

<p>You seize the spear and ascend the ladder as quickly as you can. The remaining archers are hot on your heels as you pull yourself onto the platform and rush towards the cauldron. Hastily you wedge the spear’s shaft between the chain and its mounting, and lever it back as hard as you can. The wooden shaft begins to split and, for a moment, you are gripped by the fear that all your valiant efforts will be in vain. Then there is a loud crack: the support pin has popped out and, as the massive weight of the cauldron is suddenly removed, the chain whips away like an angry snake.</p>

<p>‘How dare you delay me with trivial formalities!’ you bellow, and slap the Vazhag aside with the palm of your hand. The creature snarls and raises its spear defensively. ‘Delay me a moment longer and I’ll see you are boiled alive in your own grease,’ you growl. ‘Let me pass!’</p>
<p>Your bold threat works. The rat-man’s confidence crumbles and nervously he shuffles to one side, lowering his spear as you advance towards him. At that moment, a column of Vazhag and a wagon laden with weapons converge beneath the archway, blocking it completely. Chaos ensues, but the confusion is to your advantage. Quickly you weave your way through the crowd and into the keep beyond where you notice several smaller entrances dotted around the flagstoned square. One in particular looks promising: a staircase that descends to a portal set into the base of the citadel.</p>
<p>You are moving towards this entrance when unexpectedly you are confronted by three Cener Druids. They emerge from an alley and come walking towards you in a line abreast. To avoid them you are forced to sidestep quickly into a shadowy doorway.</p>

<p>Marching shoulder to grisly shoulder the ghoulish horde advances, hungry for flesh untainted by disease and decay. Hurriedly you draw your weapon and breathe a prayer to the Sun-god Kai to protect you in this moment of truth. Then, with a rush, the first wave fall upon you with a mindless fury. With blurring speed you deal them blows that would consign any mortal to its doom, but the grievous wounds draw neither blood nor ichor.</p>
<p>Tirelessly you slash and sever their grasping arms to prevent them from clawing you to the ground. They howl, but not in pain; these ghastly cries are joyous and triumphant. For no matter how skilfully you fight, you cannot resist their weight of numbers and, inch by relentless inch, they are forcing you ever nearer to the pits. As soon as you recognize their strategy you change your method of attack, and direct your blows at those parts of the creatures which pass for legs. Yet even now those parted from their limbs still advance, hunching and clawing their way forwards on their bellies whilst those that were once behind trample them underfoot.</p>
<p>Suddenly the advance falters and the howling ceases. The grim wall of creatures draw back a few yards and close their ranks in readiness, perhaps, for a final attack. Then, as one, they open their mouths and give vent to laughter, the like of which you have never heard before. Knots of pain build at your temples and frantically you draw upon your mind defences to repel this tidal wave of evil psychic energy.</p>

<p>Despite his close proximity, and his powerful sense of tracking, the druid fails to detect your presence here in the cavern. You hear him mumble a few disgruntled comments and then, with all the enthusiasm of a tired sloth, he leads his snickering group of rat-men into the south tunnel.</p>
<p>Patiently you wait for their flickering torches to be swallowed up by its dark depths. When you are surrounded by total darkness once more, you leave your hiding place and hurry away along the west tunnel. For more than five miles you follow this winding route and, despite your mounting fears, you encounter nothing more threatening than a few ragged-winged bats and a frightened rock snake. Gradually, as the tunnel delves deeper into the Skardos Range, the air becomes increasingly cooler and more humid. You can smell the strong scent of water somewhere in the distance and you are not at all surprised when, as you round a sharp bend in the tunnel, you see faint shimmering reflections playing upon the rough stone ceiling.</p>

<p>With gleeful malevolence the creature Exterminus takes hold of you in a bear-hug and proceeds to crush the air from your lungs. Then, with a demonic squeal of delight, it buries its needle-sharp fangs into the side of your neck and a flash of brilliant white light explodes in your head.</p>
<p>Consciousness deserts you. The sensation of falling overcomes your senses until you are consumed completely by a spinning vortex of darkness. The creature has taken your life, but more than this, it has sentenced you to a terrible punishment. You have been consigned to a realm where the power of Good holds no sway. You have been ensnared by the soul of Naar himself, the King of the Darkness, and as his prisoner you will remain, doomed to wander his dark domain for all eternity.</p>

<p>Quietly you contemplate your next move as the portcullis slams down, sealing off the main exit from Mogaruith. Within a few moments your thoughts are disturbed by the sound of a large troop of Vazhag ascending the stairs by which you entered this hall. Their approach prompts you to leave by the main door and look for another hiding place outside in the keep.</p>
<p>From the shadows of a disused store room doorway, you scour the surrounding battlements and walkways, hoping to see an opportunity for escape. However, it does not take too long to discover that the tower offered the only easy route out of this stronghold, one that is now blocked by the portcullis.</p>
<p>Suddenly you hear an angry squeal and turn to see a rat-man’s snout protruding from the window of a turret high up to your left. It has seen you and it is informing its confederates of your hiding place. You are forced to abandon the doorway and run into a nearby alley as a score of Vazhag guards come charging across the keep in hot pursuit. The alley is a dead end, but you find a stone stairway which ascends to the battlements and you take it in order to keep ahead of the bloodthirsty pack.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairs you find yourself sandwiched between two converging Vazhag patrols which are racing along the battlements from both directions. To stand and fight would be futile; you would kill many but you would eventually be overcome by the sheer weight of their numbers.</p>
<p>Now there is only one option left and the very thought of it sends a chill racing down your spine. Steeling yourself for what must be done, you sheathe your weapon, take a deep breath, and then launch yourself over the battlements towards the bubbling moat.</p>

One of them runs across your path, forcing you to halt momentarily to avoid crashing into her. But before you can continue, a Vazhag guard is shouldered away from the wagon by the crowd and he collides with you. Swiftly you grab the creature by the throat to stop it from warning its confederates, and drag it one-handedly towards the shadowy cavern wall.</p>
<p>Suddenly you feel something crawling up your forearm. A wave of revulsion knots your stomach when you see a mass of black fleas coursing up your arm, migrating from the neck of the frightened Vazhag. The ghastly sight makes you loosen your grip and allows the disease-ridden creature to squeal a desperate cry for help. As one, the guards respond to the cry. They draw their rusty weapons and narrow their tiny red eyes as they abandon the wagon and advance upon you.</p>

<p>The creatures cease their frenzied movement with an abruptness you find unnerving; it is as if they have suddenly turned to stone. Now that you can see them clearly they remind you of beetles, save that they are far larger and have long segmented tails. You observe them for a few moments longer, and then take a tentative step forwards. Instantly they burst into life, only this time they do not confine themselves to the forest floor. With a sound like a thousand squeaky door hinges, they sprout wings and soar into the air in a formation which resembles a small black cloud. Soon they have left the clearing, and as you watch the last of them disappear over the tops of the trees, you can only hope that they are not some form of lookout employed by the Cenerese.</p>
<p>On the far side of the clearing you discover that the trail continues deeper into the forest. You follow it for nearly an hour until your keen senses warn of danger ahead and immediately you halt in your tracks. You hear a movement: it is above and behind you. With incredible speed you spin on your heel and raise your weapon to parry a possible attack. Your reactions are fast, but they may not be quick enough to protect you from what lurks in the canopy of branches high above.</p>

<p>You are within twenty feet of the archway when suddenly a tremendous roar echoes around the hall. You start to run, hoping to make it through the arch and escape a confrontation, but almost immediately you are brought skidding to a halt by a terrifying sight.</p>
<p>Advancing from the alcove is a creature whose ghastly visage is the very stuff of nightmares. From its bear-like torso there protrude four tentacles and two powerful legs, all sheathed in shaggy scales. The limbs are surmounted with horny talons which glint menacingly, and its head, set with huge fishy eyes, is bulbous and disfigured by disease. It rests awkwardly upon a crooked neck which wobbles with every movement the lumbering beast makes. A livid crimson gash just below the eyes serves as its mouth, and a long tail with sharp spines swishes behind it, gouging furrows in the surface of the marble floor.</p>
<p>With surprising speed the beast is suddenly upon you, stabbing and slashing at your body with its sword-sharp talons.</p>

<p>Instantly your Bow is in your hand, an Arrow fixed and drawn ready to fire.

<p>As you force your way through the narrow thorny corridor, you are aware that the Vazhag are now streaming into the gap, close on your heels. In desperation, you turn and force your way into the wall of tangled briar and call upon your Kai Mastery of camouflage to mask your location.</p>
<p>The rat-men scurry past. You hear them in the distance, burrowing deeper into the thicket, but still you remain exactly where you are. Your caution is well-placed for soon the Vazhag retrace their steps, having lost all trace of you.</p>
<p>The Cener blazes with anger at the failure of his minions to carry out such a simple command. With a flick of his rod you see him reduce one luckless rodent to ashes, and shorten the tail of another by a broadsword’s length. Loudly he vents his displeasure and, among the oaths and vile curses, you hear him utter his intention to report to his master, Arch Druid Cadak, that there is an enemy assassin at large in the forest.</p>
<p>You know that he must not be allowed to make his report. If he were to reach Mogaruith and raise the alarm, your mission, and probably your life, would soon be over.</p>

<p>Using all your stealth and natural Kai agility, you inch your way up the rocky wall of the cavern towards the window-like gap. Your ascent goes undetected by the Vazhag guards until, by mischance, your foot dislodges a pebble and sends it tumbling down to land, with a hollow <i>thok</i>, upon the head of a snoozing war-dog. The dog erupts with a savage howl and hurls itself bodily at the rock wall.</p>
<p>Its frenzied reaction alerts the Vazhag guards and, to your horror, you see them produce bows which they load hastily and aim at your back. Throwing caution aside, you climb towards the distant gap as quickly as your aching fingers will allow, hoping to reach it before the rat-men can open fire.</p>

<p>While observing the entrance and the drawbridge for over an hour, you cannot help but notice that the flow of traffic is almost entirely in one direction: out of Mogaruith and away towards the east.</p>
<p>Occasionally a covered wagon, drawn by a team of ox-like ghorkas and escorted by Vazhag with bandaged wounds, returns along the crowded trail and crosses the moat. The guards at the main arch do not appear to challenge these wagons; they are allowed to pass directly into the keep without slowing.

<p>From deep within your being you summon the psychic energy you need to construct a fortress around your mind. The evil wave crashes against this defence and breaks into a million shards that sparkle for an instant then disappear into darkness. Your psychic energy has saved you from this concerted assault upon your mind. Yet, even as remnants of the psychic attack are fading, you sense another hostile entity is getting ready to appear.</p>
<p>From out of the black shadows of the pits you hear a dreadful rumbling roar: something huge is stirring deep within each of those dark forbidding shafts. As the ghoulish laughter reaches its pitch, you turn to see three giant, misshapen cat-like heads rise up into the light, each perched atop a snaky body as thick as the trunk of a tree. They bare their fangs and shake off the tangle of human bones that cling to their stinking, corpse-green manes.</p>
<p>The sight of these unholy creatures makes you reel back in shock and utter a cry of disbelief. Your cry is lost among the barrage of screeching howls, yet the cat-things react as if they hear it and, together, they come oozing out from their dark, noisome lairs and glide slowly towards where you stand.</p>

<p>Drawing upon your special skills and your reserves of physical strength, you pull your lower body out of the cold lake and slowly raise your knees up to your chin. The toes of your boots find footholds between the timbers and there you hold yourself, completely motionless, while your Grand Mastery of Assimilance causes your shadowy outline to blend in perfectly with the underside of the drawbridge.</p>
<p>The Vazhag scour the lake’s edge thoroughly. They search beneath the bridge, passing within a few paces of your location and yet, despite their keen senses, they completely fail to notice you. Disappointedly, they report their lack of findings to their Cenerese commander before clambering back onto the platform. You hear the Cener and the remaining Vazhag trooping across the bridge. They stop just long enough to open the Tzarg cage and drag out one of the croaking creatures. Then the cage door squeaks shut, a key jangles in its lock, and briskly the party marches away along the south passage.</p>
<p>For a full minute you remain immobile until you are sure that the enemy have gone. Then you pull yourself up onto the bridge and, without looking back, you hurry across the lake and enter the tunnel on the north side of the cave.</p>

<p>With bated breath you tiptoe past the alcove, your weapon unsheathed and held ready in case the sleeping creature should awaken. Fortunately, your Kai skills serve you well and you are able to reach the archway and leave the hall without incident.</p>
<p>A short passage leads to a junction where a wider corridor crosses from left to right. Your skin prickles in reaction to the concentration of evil you detect in this subterranean part of Mogaruith, and silently you call upon your creator, the noble God Kai, for protection and guidance before continuing.</p>
<p>Instinct prompts you to turn left, and within a few minutes you arrive at a chamber where a vast staircase of black marble ascends to many levels, lost in the gloom above. Opposite this grand staircase stands a large door, carved from a solid sheet of strange green metal, the like of which you have never seen before. It gives off a pulsating radiance which washes over the empty chamber, illuminating symbols carved into the walls and floor. You focus on these symbols and, in a chilling moment of realization, you decipher their meaning.</p>

<p>Patiently you wait for the flickering light of the Vazhag’s torches to be swallowed up by the dark depths of the south tunnel.

You are hungry and, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>For more than five miles you follow the west tunnel and, despite your mounting fears, you encounter nothing more threatening than a few ragged-winged bats and a frightened rock snake. Gradually, as the tunnel delves deeper into the Skardos Range, the air becomes increasingly cooler and more humid. You can smell a strong scent of water somewhere in the distance and you are not at all surprised when, as you round a bend in the tunnel, you see shimmering reflections playing upon the rough stone ceiling.</p>

<p>The crackling stream of energy hits the Sommerswerd with a tremendous jolt that knocks you back a few paces, yet you manage both to maintain your grip and to stay on your feet. The sun-sword absorbs the power directed against you and transfers part of that power through your hand and along your outstretched arm. The transmuted energy revitalizes and emboldens you, (restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>‘For Sommerlund!’ you cry, and cast this scabbard of sparkling energy back at the priest. Suddenly there is a tremendous flash, followed by a crackling roar as his golden rod is consumed in a blazing ball of flame. He screams as he is hurled backwards against the chamber wall by the force of the blast; then he falls to the floor where he lies completely motionless. You sheathe your sword and stare at his smouldering body, certain in the knowledge that he is no longer a threat.</p>

<p>Beyond the door lies a secret Cenerese prayer hall, a chapel of evil where the druids worship and make sacrifice to their foul gods. Kneeling in pews before a blood-red altar are dozens of figures. They chant a soulless dirge as they read from books bound in black cloth. Around the walls hang grim decorations: skulls, flayed skins, tattered battle-banners, and other ugly tributes to the power that is worshipped and coveted here—the power of death, disease, and decay.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XII]</div>
<p>You look with loathing at the congregation. In the main they are Cenerese, but there are others among them, old adversaries whose origins you recognize immediately. Acolytes of Vashna, Drakkarim, Vassagonian outlaws, Hammerlanders, and even a few Giaks. No doubt the remnants of the Darkland armies found sanctuary here after their masters’ demise.</p>
<p>A noise in the corridor behind warns that someone is approaching the antechamber. To avoid them, you slip inside the prayer hall and hide in the shadows cast by a column which supports the roof. Moments later, three druids enter the hall and close the door before taking their places among the congregation.</p>

<h3><a name="sect201">201</a></h3>

<p>You kneel beside the tunnel wall and wait with trepidation as the sound of the approaching group grows louder and nearer. Torchlight flickers, casting a watery yellow beam across the cavern floor; then the first of the group enters and you catch sight of their ugly forms.</p>
<p>A patrol of six Vazhag files into the cavern. Each one is as tall as a Sommlending youth and all are armed with crude, rusty weapons. Fragments of armour and uniforms, which once belonged to human soldiers, encase their hairy, rat-like bodies. They are no more than ten feet away from your hiding place, and they give off such a vile aroma of filth and disease that you are forced to draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to prevent yourself from retching out loud.</p>
<p>They halt at the foot of the stone stairs and talk with each other in a high-pitched squeal which reminds you of rusty door hinges. All the while they repeatedly cast furtive glances along the west tunnel as if they are waiting impatiently for another of their party to catch up. Within minutes another member of their patrol does arrive, only this creature is not one of their breed: it is human-sized. However, the hooded scarlet robe it is wearing makes it difficult for you to be absolutely sure that the creature within is human.</p>
<p>The Vazhag cease their squealing when the hooded one raises a gloved hand and motions to the south tunnel, pointing directly at the place where you are hiding. For an instant, you catch a glimpse of the glassy green mask that is covering his face, and at once you recognize this mask: it is a <i xml:lang="x-cenerese">jazak</i>, the ritual mask of a Cener Druid.</p>

<p>During the night the track has led you out of the valley and up a steady rise towards a plateau where a jutting spur of slate-grey rock stands surmounted by a score of lightning-blasted trees. There, in the shadow of the rock, your eagle-eyes detect three dark pits which have been dug side by side.

<p>Calling upon your Grand Mastery, you order the vicious war-dogs to cease their attack immediately. Instantly they obey your psychic command; they scrabble to a halt and turn their eyes to the floor, their once-chilling howls now little more than a weak chorus of kitten-like whimpers.</p>
<p>Having cowed them, you now use your power to redirect their latent aggression against their masters and, suddenly, they are transformed once more into a host of gnashing, snarling beasts. Horror fills the eyes of the Vazhag guards as their dogs turn around and come bounding towards them, hungry for the kill.</p>
<p>In the ensuing chaos, you skirt around the hall and escape through the entrance unchallenged. For a moment you are blinded by the early morning sunlight which illuminates the surrounding hills, but, as you escape along the trail which leads away from the caverns, your vision clears and you see a vast expanse of forest away to the east. This sea of sickly grey-green trees radiates an unmistakable aura of evil that immediately identifies it as the Forest of Ruel.</p>
<p>Your escape is not pursued and, after a few minutes, you stop among a cluster of boulders in order to catch your breath. The surrounding land appears deserted, the only unusual feature being the track which wends its way eastward through the hills towards a gap at the edge of the unwelcoming forest.

<p>An unholy screech, full of fear and frustration, echoes loudly in your ears. The flame-thing has detected that you are capable of defending yourself and this realization is far from its liking. For a few fleeting seconds it whirls around your head, and then, with a final howl of anguish, it dives away into the gloomy depths of the stairwell and is gone.</p>
<p>Disappointedly, the caged creatures watch the flame-thing depart before they shuffle dejectedly to the rear of their cells and settle themselves down once more. Shaken, but relatively unharmed by your psychic encounter, you stare down the stone staircase into the gloom below. Tentatively you put one foot forward, but your Kai skills and your common sense tell you that to go any further in this direction would be sheer foolhardiness.

<p>At first the Vazhag and the Cener seem unaware of your presence and you feel confident that your Kai skills are keeping your location secure. However, just as they are about to leave the cavern and head off towards the south tunnel, the Cener suddenly spins around and points directly at your hiding place.</p>
<p><i xml:lang="x-cenerese">‘Scarzh—nah!’</i> he screams, and with such vehemence that you are left in no doubt that you have been detected.</p>
<p>The Vazhag draw their weapons and rush towards the steps in response to their leader’s cry. The sudden danger galvanizes you into action and, like a panther hungry for the kill, you spring to your feet and leap among the onrushing rat-men, striking down the two nearest with one wide, sweeping blow. Before they have fallen you kick out at the chest of another and feel its ribs crack under the impact. A side-swipe puts paid to a fourth of their number, neatly parting its disease-riddled head from its shoulders and, as you pause to draw breath, you see the remaining enemy backing away in shocked confusion.</p>
<p>Ineptly they fumble with their weapons while the Cener screams at them to avenge their slain comrades. One Vazhag plucks up enough courage to attack you but you duck its whistling sword stroke with ease. Before it can strike again, you dispatch the beast with a lightning-fast stab through the heart. Your strike is executed with such economy of movement that, to the druid and the remaining Vazhag, it looks as if you hardly moved at all. For the sole surviving Vazhag it is the last straw and, with a squeal of abject terror, it drops its torch and rusty blade and abandons the druid for the dark safety of the south tunnel.</p>
<p>Cursing vilely, the Cener retreats until his red-robed back is pressed flat against the cavern wall. His mask hides his entire face, yet even so you can sense the blazing hatred that is pouring from his eyes, as if it is a stream of liquid fire. You raise your weapon and advance, eager to finish him swiftly, but you are halted by a sudden, unexpected pulse of psychic energy that crashes like a wave against your mind.</p>

<p>You follow the narrow passageway which gradually ascends towards the north. The clanging of a distant alarm bell reminds you that all of Mogaruith has been alerted to your presence and, in light of the devastation you have caused, you know better than to expect mercy from the Cenerese if they should catch you now.</p>
<p>After a few minutes the passage arrives at a hall where a railed balcony overlooks a deep circular shaft. A broad stone staircase at the north wall ascends to the next level and you stride swiftly towards it. As you pass the balcony you pause for a moment to stare down at a fascinating sight. Hundreds of feet below, at the base of the shaft, huge vats filled with a sickly brown fluid bubble and seethe as if they are boiling on a hob. You notice scores of robed druids standing on a great iron gantry suspended above these vats, each one equipped with what appears to be a gigantic butterfly net. They are busily scooping up large brown objects which keep bobbing to the surface of the morass. You use your Magnakai skills to magnify your vision and, as the scene looms larger, you see that the objects are alive. Your stomach churns with revulsion when you suddenly realize what it is that you are looking at. These are the spawning vats in which the Ceners create their loathsome, disease-ridden Vazhag.</p>

The crackling ray speeds past below your feet and explodes harmlessly among the ancient rocks. As the dust settles, you arrest your levitation and lower yourself back towards the ground, your muscles tense in readiness to run as soon as your boots touch down.</p>
<p>The druid is visibly stunned by your display of magic. However, he quickly recovers his senses, and as soon as you return to the ruins he shouts at his Vazhag minions, commanding them to attack and rip you to shreds.</p>
<p>With hatred blazing in their blood-red eyes, the Vazhag advance towards the ancient ruins, each carrying a rusty weapon poised for the kill.</p>

<p>The sound of scraping metal and rattling chains echoes in your ears. You stoop to retrieve your weapon and, as you spin around, the first thing you see is the knife-like glint of fangs. From a semicircular hole in the wall a pack of war-dogs come charging into the hall, their jaws agape and their claws scrabbling on the shiny flagstones as they race towards the desk. With the cool battle-confidence of a Grand Master you brace yourself in readiness to meet their attack.</p>

<p>The glass orb explodes on impact with a loud <i>bang</i> and you are engulfed by a cloud of sickly grey gas. At once you feel your throat tighten and your stomach churn as the deadly bacteria-infested vapour penetrates deep into your lungs: lose 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Coughing and retching, you stagger towards the entrance, your escape hidden by the cloud of poisonous gas. You have inhaled a deadly cocktail of plague viruses to which the Vazhag are naturally immune, a cocktail which would have killed an average human within seconds; only your Magnakai skills have saved you from an agonizing death.</p>
<p>In the ensuing chaos, you escape through the entrance unchallenged. For a moment you are blinded by the early morning sunlight which illuminates the surrounding hills but, as you stumble along the trail which leads away from the caverns, your vision clears and you catch sight of a vast expanse of forest away to the east. This sea of sickly grey-green trees gives off an unmistakable aura of evil that immediately identifies it as the Forest of Ruel.</p>
<p>Your escape is not pursued and, after a few minutes, you stop among a cluster of boulders in order to catch your breath. The surrounding land appears deserted, the only unusual feature being the track which wends its way eastward through the hills towards a gap at the edge of the unwelcoming forest.</p>
<p>You consult your <a href="#map">map</a> and conclude that this is the Skardos Trail, the secret route used by the Ceners which leads all the way to Mogaruith itself.

<p>The wagon is filled with the bodies of dead soldiers—human soldiers—all of whom have perished from the effects of a virulent disease. They have been stripped of weapons and armour but their tunics bear a scarlet crest emblazoned with a black stallion, readily identifying them as Slovians. Several have minor wounds caused by tiny fragments of glass. The wounds are a tell-tale sign that these troops were killed by <i xml:lang="x-cenerese">narbul</i> bombs: spheres of glass filled with a mixture of explosive and deadly plague spores. They have become one of the most feared battlefield weapons used by the Cenerese against the Freeland armies.</p>
<p>As the wagon trundles across the drawbridge you ponder why the Vazhag should be transporting a wagonload of dead Slovian soldiers to Mogaruith. Before you can fathom an answer, the wagon passes through the great arch and comes to a halt on the north side of the stronghold’s keep, close to an open doorway. Before the Vazhag disembark, you leap from the wagon and hide just inside this shadowy entrance to avoid being seen.</p>

<p>Your killing blow decapitates the monstrous lake creature, sending its vile head, with its fanged jaws still clashing madly, spinning through the air to splash into the foam-flecked waters close to the platform. For a few moments the weaving neck, its scaly stump oozing reptilian gore, thrashes the surface before it, too, is swallowed up by the cold dark waters of this underground lake.</p>
<p>Aching and breathless, you sheathe your weapon, and then wipe the spatterings of Dholdaarg blood from your face with the back of your trembling hand. The Tzargs, who were silent throughout your titanic struggle with the lake monster, now rattle the bars of their cage and croak incessantly. You recognize their crude language enough to realize that their captors are returning. However, before you can act on their warning, a shudder runs through the timbers of the drawbridge and you are forced to grip tightly with both hands as jerkily it begins to descend.</p>

<p>The cauldron smashes down into the centre of the hall and explodes with devastating effect, spewing its deadly contents in all directions. A tidal wave of acid engulfs the tables, submerging and burning everything not made of stone, porcelain, or glass. The pitiful screams of the druids rise above the thunderous din as they and their deadly work are consumed by a merciless sea of corrosive.</p>
<p>Suddenly an arrow passes within a few inches of your face. The Vazhag archers have reached the top of the ladder and are poised to rush onto the platform itself. Anxiously you look around for some means of escape, but when none readily appears you fear you are trapped. Then you notice an observation platform jutting out of the wall. It is over on the far side of the hall, more than thirty yards away, and lies some ten feet below your present position.</p>
<p>A daring escape plan forms in your mind’s eye and hurriedly you cast off your Cener Robe and Mask, a disguise which is now redundant, and prepare to enact your vision (erase the Robe and Mask from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>). You reach out and grab hold of the chain which once supported the cauldron. Then, using all your strength, you draw it back and leap into the air as the momentum carries you off the platform.</p>
<p>Your stomach churns as you swing across the hall and glance down at the dreadful carnage taking place a hundred feet below. Angry squeals and a clutch of arrows follow in your wake as the Vazhag archers try desperately to prevent you from getting away. Grimly you cling to the chain as it nears the end of its arc, and try to ignore the arrows that are whistling by on either side.</p>

<p>There is a moment of terror when first you glimpse the hideous visage which emerges from the portal. It is of a gigantic hound with mad red eyes that burn into your mind with a furnace-like intensity. It sees you and howls ferociously, baring yellow fangs dripping with foam.</p>
<p>Before it can leap up you release your Arrow and plant it deep into the creature’s ghastly skull. The beast roars as the Arrow penetrates its head but the wound does not stop it from attacking. Aghast, you drop your Bow and unsheathe a weapon to meet its assault. Moments before it strikes, you glimpse the outline of an armoured warrior standing in the open doorway. He is shouting at the beast, commanding to rip you to shreds.</p>

<p>You spin around to see a figure standing in the doorway. He is tall and his sharp features are framed by a mane of flowing platinum hair. In his left hand he carries a wizard’s staff and in his right he holds a feathered quill, the pen of the creature who was once his scribe.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XIV]</div>
<p>‘Was it you who murdered Cordask?’ he asks, his powerful voice devoid of the slightest emotion. But when you do not answer him immediately his voice and his expression undergo a dramatic change. His eyes radiate an unearthly glow and your skin tingles as you feel his psychic energies probing at your mind.</p>
<p>‘You are not a brother,’ he growls, like a rabid dog, and casts the quill aside.</p>
<p>‘Take off your mask and show your true self…assassin!’</p>
<p>And with that he advances towards you with his staff pointing straight at your heart. You raise your weapon defensively and, in the blink of an eye, a crackling flame lights at the tip of his staff and comes roaring towards your chest.</p>

Your first concern is to part company with your undead companion as soon as you can, for his presence is already attracting attention from the passing Vazhag. An empty storehouse becomes his new home and, after you have paused to bolt the door, you make your way stealthily towards a staircase which descends to a grand portal set into the base of the stronghold’s citadel.</p>
<p>You have reached the north side of the keep when you are unexpectedly confronted by three Cener Druids, who turn a corner and come walking towards you in a line abreast. To avoid them you are forced to sidestep quickly into a shadowy doorway.</p>

With a hollow <i>thok</i> the Arrow skewers the beast’s scrawny throat, lifts it bodily from the bridge, and sends it toppling end-over-end into the lake.</p>
<p>Undeterred, the remaining Vazhag come thundering off the drawbridge and onto the platform. With the magic curses of their leader echoing in their ears, they leap to the muddy shore and charge straight at you, their rusty weapons glinting dully in the light of the cave.</p>

<p>Mindful of how near you have just come to being detected, you hurry to the section of wall from where the druid appeared and search for a way to make it open once more. You discover a lever and, within seconds of pulling it, the concealed panel glides inwards allowing you access to a secret passage.</p>
<p>The narrow passageway descends by steps and slopes to a chamber which is lit by two large black candles, fixed into holes in the surface of a marble slab. On a nearby table lie the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Arrows</li>
<li>Enough food for 2 Meals</li>
<li>2 Daggers</li>
<li>1 Sword</li>

<p>If you wish to take any of these items, remember to adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>Opposite the slab there is a door which opens into a narrow corridor. You step through and follow this corridor to a room where stands an imposing door made of sheeted copper, inlaid with a filigree of gold and silver. It is the only exit from an otherwise drab and gloomy chamber.</p>
<p>A closer inspection of the door reveals that it is surrounded by an airtight seal. Furthermore, there is no keyhole, bolt, or handle. However, your keen eyesight is drawn to a pattern in the door’s centre panel which, thanks to past experience, you recognize to be a sophisticated combination lock.</p>

<p>Shortly before midnight, you and the captain ride out of Stonewatch on two fine Slovarian steeds. It is another moonless night and the plain is shrouded by darkness, yet you have no difficulty in seeing the terrain that lies ahead. Using your natural Magnakai skill of Huntmastery, every flowing contour of the grassy plain is revealed to you. The captain is not so gifted, but the special spectacles he wears fully compensate for his lack of night vision. They were a token of gratitude from the Arch-Chief of Chaman for his services in defence of the city of Gleesh during the war against the Darklords, and often they have been of use to the captain when scouting his country’s border with Ruel.</p>
<p>In less than an hour you arrive at a grassy knoll which overlooks the dense, forbidding wall of trees that is the Forest of Ruel. You are dismounting when something causes you to halt mid-way. You perceive a scent being carried on the night air: it is the heavy, cloying stench of decay.</p>
<p>‘There is great evil here,’ says the Captain, observing your reaction. ‘You would not be thought faint-hearted were you to return with me to Stonewatch.’</p>
<p>‘I will return to your fortress, Captain,’ you reply, your voice quietly resolute, ‘but not until my task at Mogaruith has been completed.’</p>
<p>The captain smiles and raises his steely hand in a salute to your brave determination. ‘Very well, my lord. So be it. Until that glad day dawns I shall pray for your safety and success.’</p>
<p>Then he brings his horse about, takes yours by the reins, and bids you a final farewell before heading back to Stonewatch. ‘May the gods watch over you and deliver us swiftly from the darkness of Mogaruith.’</p>
<p>You return his salute and watch as he gallops away with your steed in tow. Then, when finally he disappears, you turn to observe the gloomy forest perimeter. At first, the tangle of underbrush and trees appear to be so interwoven that they form an impregnable wall. Yet, at length, you see that there are two points where entry is possible. The first is where a sickly stream emerges from the forest to feed a stagnant, scum-encrusted pond; the second is where a tree has fallen and torn a hole in the thorny briars.</p>

<p>The inquisitive Tzarg passes within a few feet of your hiding place, but your Magnakai skills save you from detection. Eventually it waddles into the passageway from which you entered the hall and hurries off with an excited group of Vazhag close on its heels, all of them now convinced by the Tzarg’s actions that it has picked up your trail.</p>
<p>Patiently you wait until the sound of their footsteps has faded before you emerge from your hiding place and leave the hall by the stairs.</p>

<p>Using your camouflage skills to mask your passage, you enter the forest and follow the track into the deepening gloom. Your senses come alive to the evil that permeates every root and branch of this forbidding place and, as darkness closes in, your fears are heightened by a sickly mist which seeps out of the ground. Its corpse-like chill leaves you shivering, despite all your efforts to shield yourself from its clammy touch.</p>
<p>You are a Grand Master and night no longer restricts your vision. As the track ascends towards a wooded peak, you see the outline of a ruined stone watchtower perched atop a rocky knoll. You sense that the tower is deserted and, keen to escape from the mist, you climb towards a crack in its granite base. You crouch to enter the jagged breach and, in doing so, you disturb a host of crab-creatures nesting within. In a frenzy they scuttle away from the tower, disappearing among the surrounding rocks in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Aching with fatigue, and mindful of the perils which still lie ahead, you settle yourself into a corner of the rubble-strewn tower and try to snatch a few hours of sleep. This night your slumber is disturbed by strange and unwholesome dreams, formed from the fears suppressed by your conscious mind. You are hunted by phantom shapes which take the form of friends and fellow countrymen. Kai initiates under your tutorage and simple Sommlending folk, their heads bowed and their faces pitted and disfigured by plague, drift past you in a seemingly endless procession.</p>
<p>You awake with a start, your pulse racing and your forehead glistening with beads of sweat. At first a sense of hopelessness washes over you, brought on by the vivid memory of your nightmare, but as your consciousness returns, so too does your inner strength. You perceive the dreams as a warning of what will happen should your quest fail, and this realization strengthens your resolve to reach Mogaruith and thwart the Cener’s evil plan.</p>
<p>You have slept for several hours and, physically at least, you feel refreshed (restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). In the half-light of early morning you gather together your equipment and weapons in readiness to resume your perilous journey to Mogaruith.</p>

<p>You draw upon your healing skills to deaden the searing pain just long enough so that you can reach down and snap the arrowhead from the shaft. Then, as swiftly as you can, you withdraw the shaft and cast it down into the hall.</p>

<p>Your Arrow misses its mark and arcs harmlessly into the trees, allowing the druid to effect a hasty escape along the forest track. Cursing your luck, you run across the clearing and give chase.</p>
<p>You have been on his trail for less than a mile when you sense danger ahead. The druid has managed to reach another patrolling pack of Vazhag, much larger than his own escort, this one led by six of the druid’s brethren. He informs them of your presence and, using their corrupted form of herbcraft, they cause the undergrowth to close in upon you and hold you prisoner. Marshalling all your skills, you manage to cut your way free of its grip, but not before the druids have mustered reinforcements from Mogaruith.</p>
<p class="deadend">They attack you mercilessly with the full might of their evil craft. Courageously, you defy them, but their combined power is far greater than even a Grand Master can withstand.

<p>Walking across the age-blackened drawbridge towards the spiky arched tower of Mogaruith is an unnerving experience. It is as if you are walking along a blackened tongue towards the gaping throat of some gigantic dragon. On either side the bubbling moat releases foul fumes which fill your nostrils with a terrible sugary stench that clogs your lungs and blurs your vision. You draw upon your Magnakai skills and your vision clears, but the sight which lies ahead looks no more inviting than it did before.</p>
<p>At the tower you are challenged by a troop of Vazhag guards. Using your Magnakai Disciplines of Animal Control and Pathsmanship to aid your deception, you inform them that you have come to deliver the zombie to Brother Croumah at the Hall of Sacrifice.

<p>You insert the gleaming key into the keyhole and twist it clockwise. There is a faint <i>click</i> and, as you push, the wall glides inwards then moves away to your right. It reveals a small well-kept chamber, its walls lined with shelves containing hundreds of stoppered jars, each one neatly labelled.</p>
<p>The jars contain all manner of compounds and elements, from worthless dirt to precious gold dust, and many herbs besides. You search along the shelves and take down half a dozen jars whose contents you recognize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laumspur (Enough for 5 doses) Restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when swallowed after combat.</li>
<li>Alether (Enough for 4 doses) Increases <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 2 points for duration of one fight only.</li>
<li>Gallowbrush (Enough for 2 doses) Induces 10 hours’ sleep and loss of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points per dose.</li>
<li>Sabito (Enough for 2 doses) Enables user to breathe underwater.</li>
<li>Laumwort (Enough for 3 doses) Restores 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points if swallowed before or after combat.</li>
<li>Oede (Enough for 1 dose) Very rare and valuable. Many healing properties. Cures serious diseases. Restores 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points if swallowed before or after combat.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to keep one or more of the above jars, remember to record your choice on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.

<p>Your Arrow strikes the druid in the back and its tip skewers his evil heart. He takes a few faltering steps, and then raises his arms and vents his death-cry before collapsing into the undergrowth.</p>
<p>You run to where he has fallen and, as you reach his lifeless body, the Vazhag pack appear, alerted by his scream. The moment they see you, standing over their leader like a hunter over his kill, their nerve appears to crumble. They lower their weapons and begin to edge away. Then the leading rat-men panic; they turn and run, and the others quickly follow suit, leaving you alone with the body of the dead druid spread-eagled at your feet.</p>
<p>Curiosity prompts you to prise away the druid’s green mask and look upon the face of this servant of evil. It is an ugly, disease-riddled face, human in shape yet lacking any trace of humanity. Reluctantly you search him and discover the following items:</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Cener Robe (if kept, this item will occupy 2 spaces in your Backpack)</li>
<li>Cener Mask</li>
<li>20 Lune (equivalent to 5 Gold Crowns)</li>

<p>If you decide to keep any of the above, remember to adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>Your Magnakai skills tell you that the golden rod no longer possesses any magical aura; its destructive powers vanished the moment its wielder breathed his last.

<p>You draw aside the mouldy velvet curtain and at once your senses are assailed by an unwholesome aroma redolent of decaying flesh. Beyond the curtain a narrow passage descends, by means of a wooden ramp, to the edge of a dark circular pit. Cautiously you approach the rim and peer down into this reeking hollow. There, lying asleep on a mouldering bed of straw, ten feet below, is a gigantic dog-like creature. It has a shiny blue-black hide and a huge crocodile-like jaw. It is muscular, although its powerful limbs are scarred and pined with an unsightly disease.</p>

<p>You enter a small foul-smelling chamber lit by a single candle perched atop a three-legged stool. A bed with a straw mattress fills one corner, and a bench with drawers stands by its side. A shelf on the wall displays three cracked plates, a lump of stale cheese, some dried meat, some bread, and a bottle of brownish water (in all, enough provisions for 1 Meal).</p>
<p>You pull open the drawers and find some assorted clothing, infested with fleas, and a Copper Key. If you decide to keep the Key, remember to record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.

<p>You flick the lever and turn to approach the throne room door. There is a faint rumble and the great metallic portal slowly glides open to reveal Arch Druid Cadak’s private domain.</p>
<p>The room is little larger than the antechamber; however its furnishings and appointments are lavish in the extreme. Ornately carved furniture, inlaid with gold and precious gems, lines walls hung with priceless tapestries and paintings. At the centre of the chamber stands a great black chair, sculpted to display demonic creatures paying homage to the Cenerese. Glowing orbs hang suspended from the ceiling, bathing the chamber in a multi-hued light which is continually changing in colour and intensity.</p>
<p>Although your eyes and your Kai senses tell you that the chamber is empty, you are reluctant to pass through the door. A stench of pure evil is flooding out from this room, wafting over you like an invisible sea that seeks to soil and corrupt all it touches. Fighting back your nausea, you force yourself to cross the threshold and search the chamber before its owner returns.</p>
<p>Of all the precious items which crowd this room, your eye is attracted to three that seem to stand out from the rest. The first is a large crystal sphere which rests on a table beside the great chair. The second is a tapestry, the largest of them all, which hangs directly opposite the door. And the third is a gold statuette which rests on a shelf to your left.</p>

<p>For an hour you follow the muddy track as it twists a tortuous route through the trees of this accursed realm. Baleful eyes observe your passing yet you choose to ignore them for you sense that these watchers pose no real threat to your safety. They are lowly animals that possess little intelligence and even less courage (though you fancy the latter would not be so if you were weak or wounded). The path ascends a ridge, and then drops steeply towards the floor of a mist-enshrouded valley where you happen upon something that brings you to a halt.</p>
<p>A moss-grown skull lies on the path ahead, its jawbone agape as if uttering a silent scream. Beyond it lie two skeletons in rotting mail, half-buried in a nest of saw-toothed briar. Then, through the mist, you see weapons, rusted and mouldering, and the grisly remains of a warhorse, its armoured rider slumped astride its ruined back. You are advancing towards the horse when you hear a sound that draws your eyes away to the east. It is a busy, squeaking noise, muffled by the dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>You leave the path and melt into the tangled trees. With careful steps you edge towards the noise, your senses straining to extract information from your surroundings until you become almost a part of the forest itself. Then you detect movement ahead and, from the cover of a thorny bough, you draw your weapon and wait in readiness.</p>
<p>A line of rat-like creatures, each as tall as a youth, is wending its way along the forest path. They are armed with crude and rusty weapons and clothed in rags that once were worn by human soldiers. Your keen sense of smell detects the vile aroma of disease which hangs heavy about these loathsome rat-men, and at once you realize that these must be the Vazhag that Rimoah spoke about. Shielded by your Magnakai skills, you watch in silence as they file past your hiding place and slowly disappear. When you are sure they have gone, you sheathe your weapon and continue your trek towards Mogaruith.</p>

<p>You have climbed little more than halfway up the shaft when a snickering growl echoes from below. Awoken by falling clods of earth and dust, the gigantic dog-like creature now stands erect with its head tilted back and its fiery red eyes fixed on you. It gives a hungry roar and, with terrifying agility, it leaps from the pit and starts to claw its way up the shaft after you. Hurriedly you press on in the hope of reaching the entrance before this creature reaches you.</p>
<p>You are less than ten feet from the top when the creature slashes at your legs with its razor-sharp claws. A searing pain shoots through your calves, making you cry out with shocked surprise: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Quickly you draw up your injured legs before it can strike again, and you glimpse the beast’s huge fang-filled jaw. It snaps at your feet ravenously, spraying them with its foul saliva, and at once you know that you cannot hope to out-climb this horror. If you are to escape from the shaft in one piece, you must fight this creature to the death.</p>

<p>Slowly you advance towards the shimmering lights and, as the tunnel begins to level off in the distance, you see that it opens out into a huge cave. The shimmering is caused by a line of glowing beacons hung by chains from the vault-like ceiling of the cave. Their warm amber light is reflecting upon the cold dark waters of a lake.</p>
<p>At first there appears to be no way across the lake, but as you draw nearer to the tunnel’s end you see a spur of rock and a raised drawbridge on the opposite side. On the near side, close to a platform upon which the bridge rests when lowered, there stands a large iron cage filled with giant frog-like creatures. These must be the Tzargs that Lord Rimoah spoke of, the scouts bred by the Ceners to guide them through the swamps of Caron. A pair of Vazhag are teasing and taunting the Tzargs with sharpened sticks, jabbing them through the criss-crossed bars of their rusty cage.</p>
<p>After a while the rat-men tire of their spiteful game. Casually they cast their sticks into the lake and then settle themselves down upon the muddy shore. The larger of the two produces a haunch of maggoty meat from a haversack slung over its shoulder, and eagerly the two Vazhag proceed to devour this vile food. Both are seemingly oblivious to the hungry cries of the caged Tzargs.</p>

<p>With your lungs aching desperately for air, you propel yourself towards the shimmering, pale blue light and burst through the surface, choking and spluttering like a netted fish. You gulp at the cool air hungrily and try simultaneously to take stock of your new surroundings. You have surfaced in a vaulted chamber, small by comparison with the one from which you have just escaped, but substantial nevertheless. Here, there is no shoreline, just sheer rock walls, but to your left you see a narrow ledge of flat stone and you swim towards it. As you clamber out of the water you notice the source of the pale light that drew you to this chamber. Directly above the ledge there is a natural chimney which rises into the ceiling, and at its end you see a warm, lantern-like glow. The chimney is rough and pitted, and to someone of your experience it is as easy to climb as a wide-stepped ladder.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes you reach the neck of the chimney and find yourself staring through a hole at the floor of a passageway beyond. The source of the light comes from several oil lamps which hang at regular intervals from the roof of this narrow tunnel.</p>

The sight of your stern, blood-flecked face is enough to break the nerve of these Vazhag guards, especially now that their canine protectors lie sprawled in a lifeless heap upon the cavern floor. Shivering with fear, the rat-men retreat and allow you to escape unchallenged.</p>
<p>For a moment, as you emerge from the hall, you are blinded by the early morning sunlight, but as you escape along the trail which leads away from the caverns, your vision soon clears and you see before you a vast expanse of forest away to the east.

<p>Your escape is not pursued and, after a few minutes, you stop among a cluster of boulders in order to catch your breath.

<p>Your bold threat works. The rat-man’s confidence crumbles and nervously he shuffles to one side, lowering his spear as you advance towards him. At that moment, a column of Vazhag and a wagon laden with weapons converge beneath the archway, blocking it completely. Chaos ensues, but the confusion is to your advantage. Quickly you abandon your undead companion and weave your way through the crowd, into the keep beyond. There you notice several smaller entrances surrounding the flagstoned square. One in particular looks promising: a staircase that descends to a portal set into the base of the citadel.</p>

One brushes against your foot and immediately the others hone in on your position like a swarm of hungry eels. You raise your weapon and strike a mighty blow which tears away a great swath of the creature’s wriggling limbs. A fountain of ichor erupts from every severed end and, from somewhere above the canopy of branches, you hear an unearthly roar of pain. Once more the remaining tendrils seek you out; this time they are no longer soft and fibrous, but stiff and studded with barbed thorns.</p>

Shock ripples through the ranks when the Vazhag victim emits a strangled squeal and falls snout-first into the mud, but their sudden fear is soon dispelled when, from the safety of the bridge, the druid bellows an angry command.

<p>The sphere was not of this world. It was fashioned in the Plane of Darkness, the domain of Naar, King of all that is Evil.

<p>Banedon issues the order to his dwarven crew to set a course for Palmyrion. Then, as the hum of the craft’s powerful engine rises in pitch, he ushers you into his cabin where a welcoming meal awaits. Effortlessly the <cite>Skyrider</cite> ascends into the moonless sky and speeds southwards across Sommerlund’s forested heartland, while you endeavour to enjoy your friend’s good food and company and try not to dwell too much on the daunting task that lies ahead. Together you reminisce about past times spent aboard the <cite>Skyrider</cite>, and recall the adventures you shared in the far-away lands of Anari and Vassagonia.</p>
<p>A few hours later, as your airborne voyage is nearing completion, the conversation turns to the quest in hand. Banedon tells you that you are bound for the Palmyrion city of Holona where your guide, Captain Cearmaine, is patiently awaiting your arrival. At once you recognize the name; you recall having heard tell of the captain’s feats of bravery during the Darklands War where his actions won more than a single battle and earned him commendations from more than a dozen Freeland nations. Lord Rimoah has served you well, for in all of central Magnamund you could not have wished for a better guide than Cearmaine.</p>
<p>It is an hour after midnight when the <cite>Skyrider</cite> passes over the glimmering waters of the River Reloni and descends towards the flat-roofed Canatarium, the largest of Holona’s eight municipal halls. There you are greeted by the Captain, a man whose proud face bears the scars of his many battles. He offers his hand in friendship and you are mildly shocked when your fingers close around a palm crafted of cold steel.</p>
<p>‘A keepsake from the Battle of Vellino,’ he says, raising his metal hand so that you may inspect it in the light of the <cite>Skyrider</cite>’s bow lanterns. ‘Alas, the first was stole away by a Drakkar’s axe.’</p>
<p>Captain Cearmaine is eager to leave Holona before sunrise. His carriage awaits to take you south to his command at Stonewatch, a military fortification which stands within sight of the Forest of Ruel. Before you leave, Banedon wishes you success and godspeed. He and his crew will be awaiting you here in Holona in readiness to return you to Sommerlund once the quest has been accomplished. You bid your old friend a fond farewell then settle yourself down into the plush comfort of the captain’s carriage.</p>
<p>For four hours you are lost in dreamless slumber as the carriage wends its way across a hundred miles of open grassland trail. When next you open your eyes it is to the sight of a grey dawn breaking over the Palmyrion Plain, and the sound of a sentry’s war-horn announcing your arrival at Stonewatch. A company of horsemen, each clad like the captain in ring-mail armour and a flowing chequered tunic of crimson and blue, emerge from the outpost and ride forward to meet the carriage. The captain acknowledges their salute and watches with pride as faultlessly they change formation to escort the carriage through the outpost’s stout wooden gate. Beyond lies a drill square that, even at this early hour, resounds to the shouts of command and the measured stamp of soldiers’ feet. You disembark near a watchtower and swiftly the captain ushers you inside and leads you to his quarters on the uppermost level.</p>
<p>You spend the day in his company and together you discuss your approach to Mogaruith while you wait for night to fall. After careful study of his maps, the captain proposes two possible routes by which you can reach the Cenerese stronghold. The most direct way is to enter the Forest of Ruel and journey due east. This is by far the shortest way, but it could also prove to be the most perilous. You recall Rimoah’s account of what lurks in this dread forest and the memory alone is enough to send a shiver coursing down your spine. The alternative is to journey southwards into the Skardos Mountains and enter one of the many subterranean passages that pass through that range. If you can find your way to the Skardos trail, the secret route by which the Cenerese enter and leave their realm, you should be able to follow it all the way to Mogaruith.

<p>With deceptive ease you reach forward and pluck the spinning blade from the air when it is barely inches in front of your chest. The Vazhag looks at you aghast, frozen momentarily by the shock of what it has witnessed, but it is galvanized into action upon the instant you send the blade spinning back across the chamber, aimed at its head.</p>
<p>The knife misses the creature’s head by a finger’s length, strikes the chamber wall, and rebounds with a dull metallic <i>clang</i>. It falls at the Vazhag’s feet and is snatched up in its defence as you advance swiftly upon the creature, weapon in hand.</p>

<p>Raising your right hand, you call to mind the thoughts of the Brotherhood Spell of Lightning Hand, as taught to you by Guildmaster Banedon, and focus the power of this spell upon the tips of your first three fingers. You feel a burning sensation. It becomes more intense until your whole hand aches with a gnawing pain (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>You are tempted to abandon the spell but quickly you stifle this urge and project the spell at the middle of the fleeing druid’s back. There is a crackling sound, like the crumpling of dried parchment; then a bright blue light shoots from the tips of your fingers and hits the Cener like a hammer between the shoulder blades, sending him sprawling head-first into a tangle of thorny briars.</p>
<p>Stunned and groaning, the druid fumbles for his slender golden rod and quickly his spindly fingers locate it. However, before he can use it to retaliate, you sprint across the clearing, weapon in hand, and slay him with a single blow to the head. Curiosity prompts you to prise away the druid’s green mask and look upon the face of this servant of evil. It is an ugly, disease-riddled face, human in shape yet lacking any trace of humanity.</p>
<p>Reluctantly you search him and discover the following items:</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Cener Robe (If kept, this item will occupy 2 spaces in your Backpack)</li>
<li>Cener Mask</li>
<li>20 Lune (equivalent to 5 Gold Crowns)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to keep any of the above, remember to adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>Your Magnakai skills tell you that the golden rod no longer possesses any magical aura; its destructive powers vanished the moment its wielder breathed his last. You stoop to prise it from the dead druid’s hand, but as soon as your fingers touch its metallic surface it disintegrates into a foul-smelling dust.</p>
<p>With twilight but an hour away, you leave the clearing via the gap and hurry along the muddy track beyond.</p>

<p>In case there are any among the congregation who have the power to sense your presence, you draw upon your Disciplines of camouflage and mental defence to minimize the risks of being detected.</p>
<p>A few uneventful minutes pass until another druid enters the hall, ascending from a circular stairwell to your left. He is a tall, imposing figure, dressed in glittering blue robes edged with black velvet. The congregation rises as he walks to the altar, where he turns to face them.</p>
<p>‘Be seated my brothers,’ he commands, in a voice that is deep and resonant. At once you suspect that he is Arch Druid Cadak himself, but his opening address soon dispels this idea.</p>
<p>‘The battle against the Slovians goes in our favour. We have repulsed their puny attacks and our defences along the Storn remain intact. The Slovians are beaten. They are too weak to threaten us again. I, Kadrian, have seen the great river running red with the blood of their slain.’</p>
<p>Upon hearing this the congregation screech their approval until Kadrian calls for silence. Then, from a tome lying on the altar, he begins to read the opening passages of a service dedicated to Xuzargha, the Cenerese God of pestilence. The gathering fall to their knees, raise the hoods of their robes, and close their eyes in reverence as they listen devoutly to Brother Kadrian’s sonorous voice.</p>
<p>Anxious to leave this hall, you look around for a means of escape. Two opportunities present themselves: the circular stairwell by which Brother Kadrian entered the hall, and a door to your right marked ‘Vestibule’.</p>

<p>The tunnel floor is mostly solid stone but heavily littered with powdered rock and mouldering rubble. Slowly you advance, treading carefully among this debris to avoid making any sound that could betray your presence. The unwholesome stench becomes stronger the deeper you explore this eerie passageway, and you feel a warmth radiating from within your chest, as if your lungs had been replaced by two gently glowing coals. Your Magnakai curing skills are working to keep you safe from harm, for the air of this passageway is thick with a host of microscopic organisms, a virulent airborne cloud of disease.</p>
<p>At length the tunnel descends to a wide landing where a stone staircase plummets into darkness. Here, to your left and right, you see two small cave mouths criss-crossed with rusty iron bars. Only the slow drip of dank water punctuates the silence, but your super-senses detect that these cave-cells are not devoid of life. Huddled in the shadows are several blue-black shapes, hunched and entangled so as to form one unseemly mass upon the floor. Languidly an eye blinks open, then another, then three more. Slowly, limbs and torso disengage themselves from the mass and rise up unsteadily. For an instant you catch sight of the whole creature and you are shocked by its awful visage. A shaggy goat-like head is perched atop a snaky neck, and it wobbles repulsively as the beast staggers upright. Like its fellow creatures, its bloated trunk is riddled with disease and decay. As it shuffles drunkenly towards the bars, you see in its hellish eyes a baleful green glow. At first you feel a mixture of revulsion and pity for these creatures, but this feeling is suddenly replaced by cold fear when you notice that the green glow does not radiate from their eyes—it is reflected in them!</p>
<p>Swiftly you spin on your heels, your hand reaching instinctively to unsheathe your weapon. Confronting you now at the top of the stone stairs there hovers a monstrous shape, fashioned as if from shimmering green flame. Two whip-like tentacles extend menacingly from its core and a toothless fiery maw gapes like a death wound from where, if it were human, its face should be.</p>

<p>You fix your eyes on the observation platform as you wait for the chain to reach the end of its arc. Upon the instant that momentum stops, you release your grip and hurtle through the air towards the platform’s rail. You have timed your jump to perfection, but your landing leaves much to be desired. You collide heavily with the rail, bloodying your nose and bruising your hands and shins, yet you still manage to hold tight and prevent yourself from falling backwards to your doom (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>

Then, as if suddenly electrified, the pudgy rat-man rolls off the divan and reaches with its paw for something hidden beneath the fur covers. You decide to make an escape and pull at the secret door, but it will not open. Somehow the Vazhag has locked it.</p>
<p>You turn to face the nervous creature, your hand on the hilt of your weapon as you advance threateningly. In response it darts towards a corner of the chamber and huddles there, shivering with fright. But before you can reach the Vazhag and pull it to its feet, there is the sound of heavy footfalls and suddenly something comes bursting through the curtained archway.</p>
<p>Before you now stands a gigantic dog-like creature with fiery red eyes. Its shiny blue-black hide ripples over a muscular frame and a huge crocodile-like jaw protrudes from its cruel, canine face.

<p>You hit the surface with a mighty splash and sink like a stone. Foul fluids fill your nose and mouth, causing you to cough and retch as you struggle to rise to the surface. You are submerged in a deadly cocktail of acids and toxic wastes from the dungeons of Mogaruith and, were it not for your Magnakai Disciplines of Nexus and Curing, you would have perished within seconds of entering the moat.</p>
<p>The Vazhag on the battlements are squealing in triumph for they are certain that you have jumped to your doom. They leave the wall and return to their duties for, in their experience, no living thing has ever survived a dip in the moat. When you do break the surface and strike out for the bank, you do so unseen. It is not until you are pulling yourself out of the moat that your luck suddenly fails you.</p>
<p>You are spotted by a group of three Vazhag returning from battle. Two are armed with spears and they face you on foot, but the third sits astride a captured Slovian steed. It is wielding a cavalry lance and you can tell by the way the rat-man balances it that it is skilled in its use. The two spear-wielders squeal their battle-cry and attack you simultaneously. However, this cry is quickly transformed into a duet of pain when you strike out and kill them instantly. They drop to the ground and almost immediately the rider is upon you, jabbing at your chest with the tip of its lance. You duck the first thrust, and steady yourself to meet the second as the Vazhag lancer turns and bears down on you once more.</p>

Confidently you explore and, unhindered by the darkness, you experience no difficulty in following its sinuous course towards the heart of the Skardos Mountains.</p>

<p>The entrance to the laboratory is unguarded, so you slip inside its open door and hide behind one of the many stone pillars that support a cavernous roof. At the centre of the chamber you see two robed figures huddled over a stone table. Surrounding them are wooden racks filled with strange implements, scrolls, books, jars, and other paraphernalia. They appear to be tending to a large frog-like creature which lies spread-eagled upon the table, its limbs secured by coarse ropes. It is not until you are two steps away from the table that you recognize the creature to be a sloat—a beast of burden much used to tow barges along the River Storn.

<p>The instant you slay the last creature an eerie silence envelops the site. The howling horde have ceased their dreadful caterwauling and now their mindless faces contort with sorrow as they stare at the sundered remains of the pit beasts, twitching and convulsing in the last throes of death.</p>
<p>You spin around to face the horde, your steely gaze taunting them to approach you if they dare. But none possesses the will to continue and slowly, one by one, they turn and melt away into the surrounding trees, like phantoms into a mist. Lying on the gore-stained ground close to the pit’s edge, you notice a coil of fine copper chain. You pick it up and, in doing so, discover that it is attached to a key embedded in the mud. You can sense no aura of evil surrounding this key, and its cut and crude markings tell you nothing about its origins.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep this Copper Key, remember to record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.</p>
<p>You leave the pits and hurry on your way along the leafy tunnel. For several miles you progress in a near-darkness that is broken only by a few scattered rays of grey light creeping through the ceiling above. At length the tunnel ends and you emerge into a clearing where stand the derelict remains of an ancient stone dwelling. You approach it warily, sensing the presence of magic, yet inside its shattered walls you find nothing but mould and clumps of sickly black grass. Then your skills of divination tingle afresh as the presentiment of sorcery increases. Suddenly you realize that the source is not here in this ruined hut: it is approaching the hut.</p>
<p>Through a crack in the stones you see a gap appear in the wall of trees opposite and a group of Vazhag enter the clearing, their ratty faces sniffing at the heavy, humid air. Among their number is one who is not of their breed. He is human in size and stature, though his hooded scarlet robes make it difficult to be sure. For a moment you catch a glimpse of the glassy green mask covering his face and at once you know that this being is a Cener Druid. In his hand he carries a rod of gold that is radiating the aura of magic which you detected when first you entered the clearing.</p>
<p>The Cener calls his pack to a halt. They cease all movement and watch in quiet awe as he raises his golden rod and uses it to make a slow, deliberate sweep of the clearing. Hurriedly you draw on your Magnakai skills of Invisibility and Pathsmanship to shield you from detection as the Cener sweeps back the rod and levels it directly at the derelict hut.</p>

<p>As the last of the rat-men succumbs to your fatal blows, you look towards the bridge to see the Cener Druid gibbering with fright. He is horrified by the ease with which you disposed of his escort. Nervously he gathers up his robe and runs for the safety of the tunnel by which he and his now-deceased underlings entered the cave. Anxious not to allow him to escape and raise the alarm, you clamber out of the shallows and pull yourself onto the drawbridge in time to see his red-robed figure disappearing along the passage.</p>
<p>The tunnel beyond the bridge is narrow yet well-lit and you have no difficulty following your prey. Stealthily and speedily you close upon him like a lion running to ground a frightened fawn. He glances over his shoulder repeatedly as you draw nearer; then, in desperation, he skids to a halt beneath one of the many hanging bowls which illuminate this passageway. He raises both hands as if surrendering, but as you approach him he grasps the underside of the heavy bowl and heaves it at you.

<p>Without a sound you raise your weapon and tense yourself in readiness to strike. The Vazhag and the Cener are unaware of your presence and, as they move to enter the south tunnel, they turn their backs on where you are hiding. It is a fatal mistake, for in this instance you launch your attack.</p>
<p>Like a tiger hungry for prey, swiftly and silently you bound into the cavern and strike down the two nearest rat-men with one scything blow. A mighty kick sends a third Vazhag crashing head-first into the cavern wall, and a backhanded slash puts paid to a fourth of their number, neatly parting its disease-riddled head from its shoulders. Shocked and confused, the remaining Vazhag fumble ineptly with their weapons whilst the Cener screams frantically at them to avenge their slain comrades. With ease you duck a whistling sword stroke, and then dispatch the beast with a lightning-fast stab to its heart. Your strike is executed with such economy of movement that, to the druid and the remaining Vazhag, it looks as if you hardly moved at all. For the Vazhag it is the last straw and, with a squeal of terror, it drops its torch and rusty blade and scurries for the dark safety of the south tunnel.</p>
<p>Cursing vilely, the Cener retreats until his red-robed back is pressed flat against the cavern wall. His mask hides his entire face, yet even so you can sense the blazing hatred that is pouring from his eyes, as if it were a stream of liquid fire. You raise your weapon and advance, eager to finish the druid swiftly, but you are halted by a sudden, unexpected pulse of psychic energy that crashes like a wave against your mind.</p>

<p>You have entered a chamber constructed entirely of black marble and illuminated by artificial light. A dozen spheres of white flame hang motionless in mid-air near the ceiling, each positioned directly above an operating table bearing the corpse of a Slovian soldier. You are shocked to see that their skulls are open and empty. The brains float in glass tanks standing at the head of each table, yet still connected to their respective bodies by coils of thin copper wire.</p>
<p>Two Cenerese initiates are attending to the corpses. Their hands are sheathed in transparent gloves and they are clad in close-fitting papery suits. Startled by your dramatic entrance, they abandon their grisly work and seek the protection of their mentor, a druid who wears the hooded purple cloak of a Cenerese High Priest. He faces you across this hellish chamber, his lips drawn back in a silent, gasping snarl as he fumbles for a golden rod which is tucked into his belt.</p>
<p>‘Kill him!’ he commands, and he pushes his terrified students towards you. Hesitantly they draw their daggers and, being far more frightened of their tutor than of you, they advance. With swift and deadly precision you dispatch the two initiates and stride towards the priest, your weapon poised to deal a third fatal blow. The Cener spits a curse and instantly a sparking web of energy appears, writhing around the golden rod which he is now holding in his hand. Another curse, and the web becomes a lance of crackling power that comes surging towards your face.</p>

<p>The creepers coil around your limbs and neck in an attempt to crush the life from your body, but you resist this attack just long enough to raise your weapon and strike back. Your first blow tears away a great swath of the writhing vines and, unexpectedly, you see a fountain of ichor erupt from every severed end. Then the realization hits you that you are fighting a creature—not a plant!</p>
<p>From somewhere above the canopy of branches you hear an unearthly roar of pain. Once more the remaining tendrils seek you out; this time they are no longer soft and fibrous, but stiff and studded with barbed thorns. The swirling mass strikes out for your throat. Desperately you hack at them with devastating effect, yet one of the limbs avoids your blows and wraps itself tightly about your neck. Pain fills your head and chest as its razor-sharp thorns bite deeply into your flesh and release a powerful acid.</p>

<p>Quickly you unshoulder your pack and remove the Cener Robe and Mask. The garment and the mask still bear the vile smell of the creature that once owned them, making you hesitate before putting them on, but you are determined to enter Mogaruith undetected and, by wearing this Cenerese outfit, you hope to achieve that aim. (Erase the Cener Robe and Cener Mask from your list of Backpack Items, but note in the margin of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> that you are now wearing them.)</p>
<p>Once you have donned your disguise, you crawl to a clump of dense foliage at the edge of the forest and wait patiently for your opportunity to act. Eventually your patience is rewarded when you spy two Vazhag approaching Mogaruith from the Skardos Trail. They are leading on a chain what appears at first glance to be a man, although this impression is soon dispelled when they draw closer to your hiding place.</p>
<p>Trailing behind the Vazhag is a creature with no free will of its own, a being that was once human but is now consigned to the twilight world of the undead. The sight of this stiff-limbed zombie, propelling itself forward on withered grey limbs, fills you with revulsion and pity. With difficulty you suppress your anger at the creatures who have caused this transformation and, as the Vazhag draw level, you emerge from the foliage and order them to stop. At once the rat-men obey, deceived by your disguise and your command of the Cenerese dialect. Nervously their red eyes regard you and they shuffle uneasily as they wait for your next command.</p>

<p>There is a blinding flash followed by a terrible pain which fills your head. Then the pain subsides and you feel as if you are falling forwards into a dark, bottomless pit. The end of the heavy chain has lashed out and struck your skull, fracturing it badly. As you are plunged into unconsciousness, you lose your footing and fall to your doom in the hall below.</p>
<p>Your brave action causes the cauldron to tip its contents into the hall, thereby destroying the plague virus and the druids who know the secrets of its cultivation. This destruction has saved millions from a terrible death, and your courage in bringing this about will never be forgotten by the free peoples of Magnamund. Sadly, though, death is the price you must pay for your victory.</p>

<p>You catch sight of something huge and grey, moving just below the surface of the foaming water. For a moment it disappears; then, with a mighty splash, a great scaly head emerges with two cold reptilian eyes that flare like yellow flames. It soars up from the icy depths of the lake, perched atop a neck as stout and as long as a toa tree.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XVIII]</div>
<p>One-handedly you struggle to unsheathe your weapon as the feral-eyed beast hovers above you, its open mouth set with jagged, jet-black fangs. Hungrily it watches you and a rumble issues from its gullet as it steadies itself to strike.</p>

<p>The hideous Degradon roars in agony as your killing blow seals its fate. It crashes forward and you leap aside just in time to avoid being pinned beneath its loathsome carcass. Breathless and shaking with the fatigue of combat, you lean against the wall and survey your surroundings.</p>
<p>Before you stretches a cavernous hall, lit by the glow from fire-filled orbs hanging by chains from the ceiling. Facing each other are two rows of stone statues which form a grotesque corridor leading to an archway on the far side. Although they are human in shape, extreme expressions of pain and despair twist and contort their faces.</p>
<p>You advance cautiously. You are wary of the statues and your body is tensed to react should they show the slightest hint of animation. Fortunately your caution is unnecessary and you are able to reach the archway and leave the hall without further incident. A short passageway leads to a junction where a wider corridor crosses from left to right. Your skin prickles in reaction to the concentration of evil you detect in this subterranean part of Mogaruith, and silently you call upon your creator, the noble God Kai, for protection and guidance, before continuing.</p>
<p>Instinct prompts you to turn left, and within a few minutes you arrive at a chamber where a vast staircase of black marble ascends to many levels, lost in the gloom above. Opposite this grand staircase stands a large door, carved from a solid sheet of strange green metal, the like of which you have never seen before. It gives off a pulsating radiance which washes over the empty chamber, illuminating symbols carved into the walls and floor. You focus on these symbols and, in a chilling moment of realization, you decipher their meaning.</p>

<p>Fear and uncertainty knot your stomach as you stand and stare at the door to Arch Druid Cadak’s throne hall. Your senses scream at you to turn and run from this place for the air is so heavy with evil that you feel as if you are being slowly suffocated to death. But on this occasion you resist your instincts, for you have yet to discover where the Cenerese are cultivating their deadly plague virus and you know that the answer to that question can most likely be found here.</p>
<p>With fear running cold in your veins, you steel yourself and step towards the glowing door. As you come within a few feet of its pulsating surface, a band of intense light washes over you from head to toe.</p>

Hysterical screams of anger and fear merge into a dreadful cacophony which fills the hall with clamouring echoes.

<p>The secret door clicks shut behind you and you find yourself back in the vast, lava-lit cavern once more. Unseen, you advance towards the iron portal and wait close by, camouflaged from detection by your cloak of Kai skills, as patiently you observe the doorway and its guards.</p>
<p>After several minutes, the resonant boom of a metal gong echoes in some deep and distant part of the caves. As the echo slowly fades, another sound, that of metal scraping on stone, resounds around the cavern. Then a crack of light appears along the bottom of the portal and, with a grating screech, the great wall of black iron slowly rises up into the ceiling.</p>
<p>Through the opening comes a patrol of Vazhag who are escorting a wagon stacked high with wooden boxes, barrels, and sacks. A sudden rush of female Vazhag, all squealing and clamouring for food, brings the wagon to a halt directly beneath the onion-shaped portico. The escort struggles to fend off the hungry females with little effect until, with a spine-tingling screech, the portal begins to descend. A wave of panic washes over the Vazhag and they turn and run back into the cavern, fearful of being crushed beneath the falling iron door.</p>
<p>When it is just a few feet from the wagon, the portal shudders and grinds to a halt. Those few guards and Vazhag escort who remained nearby quickly rush forward to drag the wagon from beneath the portal.

<p>A little after midnight, you and Captain Cearmaine ride out of Stonewatch on the backs of two swift Slovarian steeds. It is another moonless night and the plain is shrouded by darkness, yet you have no difficulty in seeing the terrain that lies ahead. Using your natural Magnakai skill of Huntmastery, every flowing contour of the grasslands south of Stonewatch is revealed to your eagle eyes. The captain is not so gifted; however, the special spectacles he wears fully compensate for his lack of night vision. They were a token of gratitude from the Arch-Chief of Chaman for his services in defence of the city of Gleesh during the war against the Darklords, and they have often been of use to him when scouting his country’s border with Ruel.</p>
<p>It takes an hour to reach the foothills of the Skardos Mountains. Here, the fertile grasslands of Palmyrion give way to a hilly, weed-choked terrain which is broken by deep canyons and sharp, frowning cliffs. In the pitch blackness your eyes pick out a trail that loops down the rugged slopes towards a deep canyon floor. The captain takes the lead and you follow closely as he descends towards the mouth of a narrow gorge, situated at the far end of the canyon. Within this gorge, the trail writhes and twists like the track of a serpent as it cuts its way between two towering walls of solid rock. Strange animal-like sounds issue from hollows in the rock high above, and you feel a chill of premonition as you ride deeper into this unwelcoming gorge.</p>
<p>At length, the trail widens, and then divides in two. The captain veers left and, within a few minutes, you espy a fissure in the rock wall ahead. Silently you dismount and approach the opening with caution.</p>
<p>‘Yonder passage leads to the Skardos Trail,’ whispers Captain Cearmaine. ‘It is a sure route to Mogaruith, but one that is perilous in the extreme. More than a dozen of my bravest scouts have ventured here, alas, never to return. You would not be thought fainthearted were you to forego entry and ride back with me to Stonewatch.’</p>
<p>‘I will return to your fortress, Captain,’ you reply, your voice quietly resolute, ‘but not until my task at Mogaruith has been completed.’</p>
<p>The captain smiles and raises his steely hand in a salute to your brave determination. ‘Very well, my lord. So be it. Until that glad day dawns I shall pray for your safety and success.’</p>
<p>Then he brings his horse about, takes yours by the reins, and bids you a final farewell before turning back to Stonewatch. ‘May the gods watch over you and deliver us swiftly from the darkness of Mogaruith.’</p>
<p>You return his salute and watch as he rides along the gorge with your steed in tow. The moment he passes out of sight you turn around and steel yourself to enter the gloomy fissure.</p>

<p>Slowly you swim towards a pair of large boulders that rest half-buried in the muddy shallows of the north bank. Here you break through the waist-deep water behind the nearest rock and press yourself against its cool, smooth surface as you fight to catch your breath. Blinking the water from your eyes, you look across the lake to see the Vazhag scouring the south shore. They search beneath the bridge, passing within a few paces of where you were hanging only minutes before. Disappointedly, they report their lack of findings to their Cenerese commander before clambering back onto the platform.</p>
<p>The Cener and the remaining Vazhag cross the bridge. They stop just long enough to open the Tzarg cage and drag out one of the croaking creatures. Then the cage door is slammed shut, locked, and briskly the party march away along the south passage.</p>
<p>For a full minute you remain immobile until you are sure that the enemy have gone. Then you pull yourself up onto the bridge and, without looking back, you enter the north tunnel.</p>

<p>With a sudden rush, the leading five Vazhag fall upon you, hacking and stabbing with rust-dulled weapons. Expertly you feint and parry their attacks, and then answer their assault with such mind-numbing speed and accuracy that it is as if all five have been dispatched with one solitary blow. Their sudden deaths cool their comrades’ courage and, as the horde retreat nervously, you seize your chance and escape through the portal.</p>
<p>A few yards along the passage you happen upon a lever protruding from a grating in the floor. Instinct prompts you to pull it, and at once the great iron door descends to crush the wagon and seal off the lava-lit cavern. Safe now from the wrath of the rat-men, you explore this new tunnel in the hope of finding your way back to the surface.</p>
<p>The passage continues eastwards for several miles and, with the exception of an occasional Vazhag sentry, it is virtually deserted. At length you arrive at the entrance to another hall, smaller than the lava-cavern but equally as crowded. Daylight streams into this hall through a large archway guarded by armoured Vazhag, and pairs of horny-skinned war-dogs which they hold on the leash. Beyond the archway you can see a track which disappears towards a distant ridge of hills.</p>
<p>Directly above the archway, a thin ray of sunlight comes streaming through a window-like hole in the rock. Sorely aware that the main entrance is so heavily guarded that it will be very difficult, even for someone as gifted as yourself, to escape that way undetected, you resolve instead to escape by means of the smaller opening in the rock wall.</p>

The leading rat-men throw themselves upon you in a blood-crazed frenzy, hacking and stabbing with their rusty blades, yet you dispatch them in seconds with such precision and economy of movement that it would appear to an onlooker that you had hardly moved at all.</p>

<p>Drawing upon all of your Kai skills for aid and protection, you raise the hood of your cloak and emerge from your hiding place. The columns of armoured rat-men seem to pay little attention to you as you march boldly along the trail towards their mighty stronghold. Your skills of camouflage are working well; you can only pray that they will sustain you when you reach the archway itself.</p>
<p>Walking across the age-blackened drawbridge towards the spiky arched tower of Mogaruith is an unnerving experience. It is as if you are walking along a blackened tongue towards the gaping maw of some gigantic dragon. On either side the bubbling moat releases foul fumes which fill your nostrils with a terrible sugary stench that clogs your lungs and blurs your vision. You draw upon your skills and your vision clears, but the sight which lies ahead looks no more inviting than it did before.</p>
<p>At the tower you are challenged by a troop of Vazhag guards who regard you with suspicion and demand to know your purpose here. They will not let you pass until you answer.</p>

<p>The demonic Exterminus screams in agony as your killing blow pierces its heart. It sways for a moment, defying gravity, and then reels backwards and crashes down upon the table which stands beside Cadak’s black chair. The awesome bulk of the creature’s body crushes the table to matchwood and breaks open the crystal sphere that rested upon it. Immediately there is a loud boom and a tremendous rush of putrid air knocks you down. A funnel of darkness engulfs the body of Exterminus and, with stunning suddenness, there is silence. Both the creature and the shattered remnants of the sphere have vanished completely.</p>
<p>You stagger to your feet and turn to face the Arch Druid. The shock of what he has witnessed has left him open-mouthed and drained of colour. He is mumbling incoherently and trembling with fear. You take up your weapon and advance towards him, determined to rid Magnamund of this vile druid once and for all, but the sight of you drawing closer snaps him out of his trauma and galvanizes him into action. He weaves his hands before his face and, in an instant, he is shrouded in a cocoon of light. You strike out at the light but your weapon passes clean through it, meeting with no resistance. Then the light fades and you are left standing alone in the druid’s empty throne room.</p>

<p>As you roll, your Backpack hits the falling edge of the portcullis and jams. In the next moment you are crushed to death by twenty-five tons of oak and iron. Death is mercifully swift.</p>
<p>The incredible bravery you have displayed during your quest has brought about the destruction of the plague virus, and the druids who knew the secrets of its cultivation.

<p>You unsheathe the sun-sword and point the tip of its golden blade at the red-robed druid. From his rod leaps a second charge, a lance of crackling fire that spirals through the hole in the wall and fixes itself to the Sommerswerd like a ravenous vampire let loose upon a maiden’s throat. Instantly there is a sizzling splash of blue-white sparks and flashing webs of electrical power run back and forth along your arm. Yet you experience no pain; the dark power of the druid’s rod is no match for the goodly might of the Sommerswerd.</p>
<p>Slowly and deliberately you draw back your sword then cast away its unwelcome sheath of fire. The ball of crackling fire arcs across the clearing and scythes through a pair of trees with a splintering roar. The severed trunks teeter for a moment, and then come crashing to the ground, narrowly missing the Cener. The druid screams in fury and frustration. He curses you, and then he shouts at his Vazhag minions, commanding them to attack and rip you to shreds.</p>
<p>With hatred blazing in their blood-red eyes, the Vazhag advance towards the ruins, each with a rusty weapon poised for the kill.</p>

<p>Blood-spattered and drenched with sweat, you stagger away from the bodies of the slain hounds. It takes you a few moments to recover fully but, once you have, you set about a systematic search of the drawers of the desk. You find many scrolls and ledgers which you scrutinize for clues as to where in Mogaruith the virus is being cultivated. Unfortunately the papers yield no useful information, but your search is not entirely fruitless. Beneath the ink pot you find two small levers recessed into the desk’s surface.</p>
<p>As you examine them your Kai senses reveal that they operate the two metal doors to this antechamber. You flip the right-hand lever and the door by which you entered glides shut. Then you pause for a moment to prepare yourself before flipping the left lever, for you know that this will open the door which leads to Cadak’s throne room.</p>

<p>The flaming oil hits you like a fiery shower full in the face yet, protected by your Grand Mastery of Nexus, you suffer no harm. The Cener freezes with shock and gurgles inanely as, unhurriedly, you wipe the blazing oil from your face with the edge of your hand and pat out the tongues of flames which have sprung from parts of your tunic splashed by the oil.</p>
<p>Numbly the Cener fumbles for a weapon. He draws a curvy-bladed knife from a hidden sheath and holds it out unsteadily in front of his chest. You tell him to drop the dagger but he is deaf to your command. He lunges. You deflect his weak attack with your right forearm and counter it with a left hook to the chin which shatters the druid’s glassy mask. He reels backwards and crashes to the floor, his bony fingers clutching his throat. For a moment he writhes around on the dusty ground; then his body stiffens and he lies completely still. Cautiously you step nearer, expecting trickery. Then you see that a shattered fragment of his mask has severed his jugular vein and thus sealed his fate.</p>

<p>Swiftly you recall the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Invisible Shield</i>, and cast it by circling your right palm around your lower body as you breathe the words of the incantation. A few seconds later, a pair of Vazhag arrows come screaming towards your legs and rebound from your magical shield with a sizzling splash of sparks.</p>
<p>Saved by your mastery of Brotherhood magic, you are able to reach the gap unharmed and make your escape. You emerge on a mountainside, at a place hidden beneath an outcrop, which is ringed by wind-worn boulders and scrub. Early morning sunlight illuminates the surrounding hills, and beyond them you see a vast expanse of forest, a sea of sickly grey-green trees, which radiates an unmistakable aura of evil. The position of the sun and your Pathsmanship skills inform you that you are now looking upon the Forest of Ruel from the eastern foothills of the Skardos Mountains.</p>
<p>The land appears deserted, the only unusual feature being a wide dirt track which wends its way eastward through the hills towards a gap at the edge of the grim forest. You consult your <a href="#map">map</a> and conclude that this must be the Skardos Trail, the secret route used by the Ceners, which leads all the way to Mogaruith itself.

<p>As you sever the last of the flailing tendrils, the roaring above is replaced by a deathly silence. For a moment you remain where you stand, gasping for breath, the blood pounding in your ears. Your Kai tunic is soaked with the ichor of your unseen attacker and its rising stench is making it difficult to draw breath. Then you hear the sound of snapping branches and quickly you move aside as the body of the beast comes crashing down to earth.</p>
<p>With weapon poised you approach the huge shape. It resembles a bear, but covered in leaves rather than fur, and it possesses a bulbous head with four hooded orange eyes. Its bloated black and yellow striped body is a mass of severed stumps, and from the back of its neck there protrudes a clump of spines, like those of a porcupine, but these ooze a sticky black venom.</p>

A few minutes later, as you are exploring this new tunnel, you hear their anxious squealing cease and the great door close with a rumbling boom.</p>
<p>The passage continues eastwards for several miles and, with the exception of an occasional Vazhag sentry, it is virtually deserted. At length you arrive at the entrance to another hall, smaller than the lava-cavern but equally as crowded. Daylight streams into this hall through a large archway guarded by armoured Vazhag, and pairs of horny-skinned war-dogs which they hold on the leash. Beyond the archway you can see a track that disappears towards a distant ridge of hills.</p>
<p>Directly above the archway, you notice a thin ray of sunlight streaming through a window-like hole in the rock.

<p>You open your mouth and form your lips into an ‘O’ shape in readiness to utter the battle-spell <i>Power Word</i> you have learned from Lord Rimoah. Then, the instant the spell-thoughts focus in your mind, you project the power-word <i>Gloar!</i> at the middle of the fleeing druid’s back. Like a hammer, the sound hits him between the shoulder blades and sends him tumbling head over heels into a tangle of thorny briars.</p>
<p>Stunned and groaning, the Cener fumbles for his slender golden rod. His spindly fingers locate it, but before he can use it to retaliate, you sprint across the clearing, weapon in hand, and slay him with a single blow to the head. Curiosity prompts you to prise away the druid’s green mask and look upon the face of this servant of evil. It is an ugly, disease-riddled face, human in shape yet lacking any trace of humanity.</p>

<p>Calling upon your powers of Telegnosis, you slip easily into the trance-like state which is necessary in order for you to effect complete transcendency. At once you see yourself in spirit form, rising out of your physical body and floating effortlessly along the tunnel beyond.</p>
<p>As you drift towards the shimmering lights, you see that the tunnel opens out into a huge cave. The shimmering is caused by a line of glowing beacons hung by chains from the vault-like ceiling of the cave. Their warm amber light is reflecting upon the cold dark waters of a lake. At first there appears to be no way for you to cross the lake in physical form, but, as you draw nearer to the tunnel’s end you see a spur of rock and a raised drawbridge on the opposite side. On the near side, close to a platform upon which the bridge rests when lowered, there stands a large iron cage filled with giant frog-like creatures. You sense that they are the Tzargs that Lord Rimoah spoke of, the scouts bred by the Ceners to guide them through the swamps of Caron. A pair of Vazhag are teasing and taunting the Tzargs with sharpened sticks, jabbing them through the criss-crossed bars of their rusty cage.</p>
<p>After a while the rat-men tire of their spiteful game. Casually they cast their sticks into the lake and then settle themselves down upon the muddy shore. The larger of the two produces a haunch of maggoty meat from a haversack slung over its shoulder, and eagerly the two of them proceed to devour this vile food. Both are seemingly oblivious to the hungry cries of the caged Tzargs.</p>
<p>You sense that it is time you rejoined your physical body and so you will yourself back to where it stands in the tunnel, entranced and unmoving. The moment that your two beings are reunited, you are able to wake from your trance feeling refreshed, as if you have just awoken after a few hours’ sleep. Yet, unlike a dream, the memory of all you saw during your spirit-walk is still fresh in your mind.</p>
<p>Aware now of what lies ahead, you advance to the end of the tunnel and take up a position at the entrance to the cave, from where you observe the two Vazhag consuming their unwholesome meal.</p>

<p>As you step away from his body you suddenly sense a new danger. A number of the congregation are approaching the door, prompted to investigate by the noise of your fight. Quickly you hurry to the section of wall from where the druid appeared and search for a way to make it open once more. You discover a lever and, within seconds of pulling it, the concealed panel glides inwards, allowing you access to a secret passage. You enter, dragging the body of the High Priest behind you by the heels, and then push shut the panel just as the inquisitive congregation push open the vestibule door.</p>

<li>Alether (Enough for 4 doses) Increases <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 2 points for duration of one fight only.</li>
<li>Gallowbrush (Enough for 2 doses) Induces 10 hours’ sleep and loss of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points per dose.</li>
<li>Sabito (Enough for 2 doses) Enables user to breathe underwater.</li>
<li>Laumwort (Enough for 3 doses) Restores 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points if swallowed before or after combat.</li>
<li>Oede (Enough for 1 dose) Very rare and valuable. Many healing properties. Cures serious diseases. Restores 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points if swallowed before or after combat.</li>

<p>You drop back a few rungs, just far enough to put you beyond reach of the spear blades, and then you perform the movements of a battle-spell that Lord Rimoah calls <i>The Invisible Fist</i>. You clench your right fist, and then extend your arm and open your palm towards the enemy. A tingling rush of power surges along your arm and, an instant later, you see the Acolytes tumbling backwards, knocked over by the concussive force of the spell.</p>
<p>You seize your chance and swiftly ascend to the platform. A well-aimed kick sends one of the Acolytes toppling over the edge to fall, screaming, into the midst of some glass boxes on an experiment table far below. His partner is back on his feet, weapon in hand, and he meets your stare with a sneer that readily conveys his hatred of your race. Then, spurred on by the yells of his confederates in the hall below, he jumps forward and thrusts his weapon at your throat.</p>

<p>Your ascent to the gap goes undetected by the Vazhag guards and you emerge on a mountainside, at a place hidden beneath an outcrop which is ringed by wind-worn boulders and scrub. Early morning sunlight illuminates the surrounding hills, and beyond them you see a vast expanse of forest, a sea of sickly grey-green trees, which radiates an unmistakable aura of evil. The position of the sun and your Pathsmanship skills inform you that you are now looking upon the Forest of Ruel from the eastern foothills of the Skardos Mountains.</p>
<p>The land appears deserted, the only unusual feature being a wide dirt track which wends its way eastward through the hills towards a gap at the edge of the grim forest. You consult your <a href="#map">map</a> and conclude that this must be the Skardos Trail, the secret route used by the Ceners, which leads all the way to their stronghold of Mogaruith. You resolve to follow the trail, but first (unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery) you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stairs the tunnel continues in a straight line towards a stout wooden door that is studded and braced with iron. You sense that it is locked even before you have reached it. When you do reach the door you notice a keyhole located beneath its rust-pitted handle.</p>

<p>Without a sound you raise your weapon and tense yourself in readiness to strike. At first the Vazhag and the Cener seem unaware of your presence. But as they move to enter the south tunnel, the Vazhag suddenly freeze in their tracks and begin squealing frantically.</p>
<p>The sound galvanizes you into action. Like a panther hungry for the kill, swiftly and silently you leap among the Vazhag and strike down the two nearest with one scything blow. Before they have fallen you kick out at the chest of another and feel its bones crack under the impact. A side-swipe puts paid to a fourth of their number, neatly parting its disease-riddled head from its shoulders. You pause for breath, and see the remaining enemy backing away in shocked confusion.</p>
<p>Ineptly they fumble to unsheathe their weapons whilst the Cener screams at them to avenge their slain comrades. One Vazhag plucks up enough courage to attack you and, with ease, you duck its whistling sword stroke. Before it can strike again, you can dispatch the beast with a lightning-fast stab through the heart. Your strike is executed with such economy of movement that, to the druid and the remaining Vazhag, it looks as if you hardly moved at all. For the sole surviving Vazhag it is the last straw and, with a squeal of abject terror, it drops its torch and rusty blade and scurries for the dark safety of the north tunnel.</p>
<p>Cursing vilely, the Cener retreats until his red-robed back is pressed flat against the cavern wall. His mask hides his entire face, yet even so you can sense the blazing hatred that is pouring from his eyes, as if it were a stream of liquid fire. You raise your weapon and advance, eager to finish the druid swiftly, but you are halted by a sudden, unexpected pulse of psychic energy that crashes like a wave against your mind.</p>

<h3><a name="sect349">349</a></h3>

<p>The Cener’s dying scream alerts the Vazhag pack and they come scampering back to investigate the sound. The moment they see you, standing over their leader like a hunter over his kill, their nerve appears to crumble. They lower their weapons and begin to edge away. Then the leading rat-men panic; they turn and run, and the others quickly follow suit, leaving you alone in the clearing with the body of the dead druid lying crumpled at your feet.</p>
<p>Curiosity prompts you to prise away the druid’s green mask and look upon the face of this servant of evil. It is an ugly, disease-riddled face, human in shape yet lacking any trace of humanity. Reluctantly you search him and discover the following items:</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Cener Robe (If kept, this item will occupy 2 spaces in your Backpack)</li>
<li>Cener Mask</li>
<li>20 Lune (equivalent to 5 Gold Crowns)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to keep any of the above, remember to adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>Your Magnakai skills tell you that the golden rod no longer possesses any magical aura; its destructive powers vanished the moment its wielder breathed his last. You stoop to prise it from the dead druid’s hand, but as soon as your fingers touch its metallic surface it disintegrates into a fine, foul-smelling dust.</p>
<p>With twilight but an hour away, you leave the clearing via the gap and hurry along the muddy track beyond.</p>

<p>Drawing upon your very last reserves of strength, you fight against the powerful current and succeed in avoiding being hit by the deluge of rocks and flames. As your strength subsides, you are swept under the bridge and, minutes later, you find yourself washed up on the west bank of the Storn. A company of Slovian archers drag you from the icy water and, fearing you to be a Cenerese spy, they take you to their captain. Fortunately he recognizes your Kai cloak and tunic, and at once you are afforded the treatment and respect which befits one who holds the title of Kai Grand Master.</p>
<p>The captain sends word of your survival to the Palmyrions at Holona where, the following day, you are reunited with Captain Cearmaine and Guildmaster Banedon. Later that same day, the president of Palmyrion—Elector Manatine—arrives with his entourage and, upon learning of the success of your daring mission, he orders that an official celebration take place throughout the republic. You receive the thanks of a grateful nation and, in recognition of your bravery, the Elector presents you with the ‘Golden Star of Palmyrion’, the highest award his country can bestow upon a warrior.</p>
<p>Congratulations Lone Wolf!—you have won a major victory over the Cenerese and removed a threat which could have devastated all of Magnamund. Yet the struggle against Evil goes on. Within a few months of your triumphant return to Sommerlund a grave situation develops, a situation which threatens the life of your closest friend—Guildmaster Banedon.</p>
<p>The nature of this threat and your quest to overcome it awaits you in Book 14 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, entitled:</p>

<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio on the top of the chart and cross-reference to the random number you have picked. (E indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Enemy. LW indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Lone Wolf.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from Stage 3 until one character is dead. This is when the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either character falls to 0 or below.</li>

<li>You may only do this when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>You undertake one round of combat in the usual way. All points lost by the enemy are ignored; only Lone Wolf loses the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>If the book offers the chance of taking evasive action in place of combat, it can be taken in the first round of combat or any subsequent round.</li>

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
