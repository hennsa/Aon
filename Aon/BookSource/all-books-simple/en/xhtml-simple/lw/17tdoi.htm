   <p>You are Lone Wolf—Kai Grand Master of Sommerlund. Far away to the west lies the peninsula of Ixia. It is an icy, desolate wasteland that for 10,000 years has been the domain of Lord Ixiataaga—Masterlord of the Dead. Here he reigns supreme over a horde of lost souls, an undead populace condemned to an eternity in his service.</p>

   <p>In <strong><cite>The Deathlord of Ixia</cite></strong>, you must journey to the forbidden city of Xaagon—the seat of Lord Ixiataaga’s dark power—and confront him in a life-or-death battle which will test your Grand Master abilities to the limit. Will you overcome and defeat this terrifying entity? Or will you fall victim to his undead legions and the terrible new power they wield?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund and sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of your élite warrior caste.</p>
<p>It is the year MS 5077, twenty-seven years since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain—the Darklands—and caused the destruction of their leader and the seat of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>
<p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Some factions which were part of this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Their commanders exploited the chaos skilfully and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.</p>
<p>For seven years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a Second Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well established. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>
<p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection—to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>
<p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and the training of the Second Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded for within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. The Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities readily, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>
<p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, a hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power which you had recovered during your quest for the Magnakai. It was here, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, that you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors—Banedon and Rimoah—you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines and grasp the fundamental secrets of Left-handed and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
<p>At this time many changes were occurring beyond the borders of Sommerlund. In the regions to the northeast of Magador and the Maakengorge, the Elder Magi of Dessi and the Herbwardens of Bautar were working together in an effort to restore the dusty volcanic wasteland to its former fertile state. It was the first tentative step towards the reclamation of all the Darklands. However, their progress was painfully slow, and both parties were resigned to the fact that their efforts to undo the damage caused by the Darklords would take centuries to complete.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, throughout Northern Magnamund, peace reigns victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the age of the Darklords has finally come to an end. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>
<p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar’s agents and you have, on each occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. But your continuing victories against his minions have enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Earlier this year you thwarted Naar’s plans to revive Vashna, the greatest of all the Darklords, whose spirit is trapped deep within the fathomless reaches of the Maakengorge—the Chasm of Doom. Vashna’s spirit has remained there in uneasy entombment ever since the day, long ago, when he and his army were defeated in battle by King Ulnar I of Sommerlund. Your brave and courageous actions prevented Naar’s agents from summoning to Magnamund a Demoness named Shamath from the Plane of Darkness. This supernatural creature possessed the Deathstaff—an artefact of great evil forged by Naar himself—with which she could have resurrected Vashna and his army from the Maakengorge. Yet your timely intervention destroyed the Shadow Gate through which she was travelling, and by so doing, you imprisoned the Demoness Shamath in the limbo which exists between your world and the Plane of Darkness.</p>
<p>Confident in the belief that you had saved Magnamund from the Demoness and the Deathstaff, you returned triumphantly to Sommerlund. Several months later, however, as the year was drawing to a close, Lord Rimoah came unexpectedly to the Kai Monastery seeking an urgent audience. With growing dismay you listened as he relayed ill news—the Deathstaff had reappeared in Magnamund. The threat to the peace of your fragile world was greater now than ever before.</p>
<p>‘When you destroyed the Shadow Gate at Maakengorge, Grand Master,’ said Lord Rimoah, as the two of you discussed the matter in the secure privacy of your vault below the Kai Monastery, ‘you banished Shamath to the void, hopefully for all eternity. Yet, alas, the weapon she possessed did not go with her. Naar’s accursed Deathstaff has since returned to this world through another Shadow Gate, one that lies far away to the west, on a remote and icy peninsula that is called Ixia.’</p>
<p>‘My lord, do you wish me to go to Ixia—to find and destroy the Deathstaff before another of Naar’s agents can use it against us? Is this why you have come seeking my help?’ you replied, expecting Rimoah to affirm your assumption.</p>
<p>‘Partly so, my lord,’ he said, holding you with his steel-grey eyes, ‘but I fear that already it has fallen into the hands of an enemy—and one who is deadlier than even the Demoness Shamath. What do you know of the Deathlord of Ixia?’</p>
<p>You faintly remembered having heard this name before but were unable to recall any detail. Lord Rimoah, seeing that you were unable to give an answer, obliged with an impromptu history lesson:</p>
<p>‘The Deathlord of Ixia was once lieutenant to Agarash the Damned—the most powerful of all Naar’s champions of evil,’ said Rimoah, his head bowed as he paced the granite floor of your vault. ‘During the Age of Eternal Night he conquered much of Northern Magnamund, including the realm of Ixia which was once a rich and very fertile land. He destroyed the native Ixians, transforming them into a legion of undead servants under his command. Many centuries later, when my ancestors defeated Agarash during the Age of War, they magically imprisoned the weakened Deathlord in a secret tomb within the dread city of Xaagon, near to the southern coast of Ixia. For thousands of years his tomb lay undisturbed until the first of the Drakkarim appeared on Magnamund. They entered Xaagon and found the Deathlord’s tomb—yet legend has it that none of them escaped Ixia alive. Perhaps they, too, serve him now. During the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords conquered all of the territories surrounding Ixia yet they chose to avoid setting foot in the Deathlord’s realm. Mindful of his origins, they feared that if he were released from his sorcerous prison he would seek to dominate and destroy them.’</p>
<p>‘My lord, are you telling me that the Deathlord of Ixia is now free of this prison <em>and</em> in possession of the Deathstaff?’ you asked, fearing Lord Rimoah’s reply.</p>
<p>‘Yes, Grand Master. I’m afraid that is exactly the situation which confronts us. Since the passing of the last moon, I and others of the High Council of the Elder Magi have detected a great imbalance between the forces of Good and Evil in our world. By ill chance or by Naar’s design, the Deathstaff has fallen into the hands of Ixiataaga. Once again the Deathlord is free to indulge his unholy and insatiable appetite for living beings. Already we have heard reports from Lencian fishermen which tell of the destruction of remote Drakkarim settlements around the Gulf of Konkor, and there are even claims of a “death fleet” having been sighted in the waters of the Shakoz Bight. Yes, Grand Master, the Deathlord is free to roam the face of Magnamund once more, and I fear he will not stop until every living creature is enslaved to him in undeath.’</p>
<p>For hours, you and your trusted advisor deliberated over what could be done to prevent this unspeakable disaster from befalling Magnamund. You considered a muster of the Freeland armies and an immediate attack upon Ixia, but such a plan simply could not be executed. The peninsula of Ixia is far too remote and desolate a territory to be reached by any Freeland army on foot, and, with winter already so far advanced, any ship-borne invasion would be doomed to fail. Time was also against you. The Deathlord had to be stopped as quickly as possible before he could unleash an army of undead upon Magnamund, an unkillable army that would grow larger with every battle it fought against the living.</p>
<p>‘Only I can stop this,’ you said, voicing your thoughts.</p>
<p>‘Yes, Grand Master. Only you,’ replied Rimoah quietly.</p>
<p>After a few moments’ silence, Rimoah continued, ‘In expectation of your decision, preparations have already been made for your journey, Grand Master. I trust this doesn’t offend you?’</p>
<p>You smiled your consent.</p>
<p>‘Good. Then I shall call upon Guildmaster Banedon—he knows of the Deathlord’s rise and he has offered his ship <cite>Skyrider</cite> to hasten your journey westwards. He will tell you more about Ixia and how you will be conveyed there. Godspeed, Grand Master. I shall pray to Kai and Ishir to watch over you on this fateful mission.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>For more than six years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you begin this Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 31). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1–16), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to Book 17. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1–5) or <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6–12) adventures.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1–5) and <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6–12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13–onwards):</p>

<p>Now, through the pursuit of your new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the Gods Kai and Ishir go with you as you begin your brave and noble quest.</p>
<p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat with one of your Grand Weaponmastery weapons, you add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Defender, with which you begin the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, means you are supremely efficient in the use of <em>two</em> of the weapons listed below. For each book that you complete in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13–20), you will gain mastery of an additional weapon. For example, if you complete <cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite> and have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery at the beginning of the next <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> book, you may choose an additional Weapon to gain mastery of.</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Short Sword</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>Quarterstaff</li>
<li>Broadsword</li>
<li>Axe</li>
<li>Sword</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 to any number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.<sup><a href="#discplnz-1-foot" name="discplnz-1">3</a></sup></p>
<h4><a name="anmlmstr">Animal Mastery</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.</p>
<h4><a name="deliver">Deliverance (Advanced Curing)</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, whilst in combat, their <small>ENDURANCE</small> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. This ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
<h4><a name="assimila">Assimilance (Advanced Invisibility)</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of a few days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques that make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.</p>
<h4><a name="hntmstry">Grand Huntmastery</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and have greatly heightened senses of touch and taste. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p>
<h4><a name="pthmnshp">Grand Pathsmanship</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by hostile plants and have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.</p>
<h4><a name="kaisurge">Kai-surge</a></h4>

<p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, Grand Masters need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. When using the weaker psychic attack—Mindblast—they may add 4 points without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. (Kai-surge, Psi-surge, and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.)</p>
<p>Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>
<h4><a name="kaiscrn">Kai-screen</a></h4>

<p>In psychic combat, Grand Masters are able to construct mind fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increase as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h4><a name="nexus">Grand Nexus</a></h4>

<h4><a name="magi">Magi-magic</a></h4>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lord Rimoah, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of battle-magic, as taught to the Vakeros—the native warriors of Dessi. These skills include the basic use of Old Kingdom Spells such as <i>Shield</i>, <i>Power Word</i>, and <i>Invisible Fist</i>.

<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in this, the fifth of the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="../lw/18dotd.htm#title">Book 18</a>.</p>
<p>For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original four Disciplines you begin with, you may add 1 point to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> score and 2 points to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original four Grand Master Disciplines, and any Special Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> adventure, which is called <a href="../lw/18dotd.htm#title"><cite>Dawn of the Dragons</cite>.</a></p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you set off on your long journey to Ixia you take with you a <a href="#map">map of Ixia and the Hardlands</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1–16), you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. Fifty Crowns is the maximum you can carry, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your monastery.</p>
<p>You can take four items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess from previous adventures (remember, you are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry a maximum of ten Backpack Items).</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadsword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bow (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows; record them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>2 Meals (Meals) Each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Rope (Backpack Item)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Item) This potion restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for only one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Axe (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>List the four items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the appropriate headings, and make a note of any effect they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is strongly recommended that you also equip yourself with a close combat weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given either initial capitals (e.g. Gold Dagger, Magic Pendant), or is clearly labelled as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns. The currency of Lencia is the Lune. The exchange rate is 4 Lune for 1 Gold Crown.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 27) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving him a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 35.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Doomwolf pack’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +5. (35−30 = +5). +5 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +5. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge).</li>
<li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may evade only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, you will gain an additional Grand Master Discipline and progress towards the pinnacle of Kai perfection—to become a Kai Supreme Master.</p>
<ol>
<li>Kai Grand Master Senior</li>
<li>Kai Grand Master Superior</li>
<li>Kai Grand Sentinel</li>
<li>Kai Grand Defender—<em>You begin the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> adventures at this level of Mastery</em></li>
<li>Kai Grand Guardian</li>
<li>Sun Knight</li>
<li>Sun Lord</li>
<li>Sun Thane</li>
<li>Grand Thane</li>
<li>Grand Crown</li>
<li>Sun Prince</li>
<li>Kai Supreme Master</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="imprvdsc">Improved Grand Master Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Kai Grand Mastery, you will find that your Disciplines will steadily improve. For example, if you possess the Discipline of Grand Nexus when you reach the Grand Master rank of Grand Thane, you will be able to pass freely through Shadow Gates and explore the nether realms of Aon and the Daziarn Plane.</p>
<h4><a name="guardian">Kai Grand Guardian</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian (5 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians with this Discipline are able to  summon a limited number of forest animals to their location. The creatures so summoned will become loyal and willing allies, willing to do the Kai Grand Guardian’s bidding. This ability can only be used in an outdoor setting.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this skill are able to create a cloud of fog-like vapour within 15 yards of their location. This fog will obscure both normal and infravision. The duration of the fog increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians with this skill enjoy increased mobility when travelling across all types of terrain, whether on foot or on horseback. This improved ability is very useful when used to outdistance a pursuing enemy.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to attack up to three enemies in psychic combat simultaneously.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this Discipline are able to exercise a defensive psychic skill known as Mindblend. This cloaking ability enables them to both protect and hide their minds from being detected by a hostile psychic probe.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Splinter</i>—This causes breakable items such as bottles, jugs, mirrors, windows, etc., to shatter to pieces. The range of this spell increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Flameshaft</i>—This causes the tip of any Arrow or Arrow-like missile, to burn fiercely with a magical flame which cannot readily be extinguished by normal means.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunkght">Sun Knight</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Knight (6 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights with this Discipline are able to wield two-handed weapons (i.e. Broadsword, Quarterstaff, and Spear) with full effect, using only one hand.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature’s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Knights with this skill are able to repel at will all normal-sized insects within a radius of three yards. The range and number of insects so affected increase considerably as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Halt Missile</i>—This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may  pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2–3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight sufficient time to move away from its line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by  this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Strength</i>—By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunlord">Sun Lord</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Lord (7 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast—a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a ‘0’ = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration and degree of surface difficulty increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Lord are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Penetrate</i>—This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
<li><i>Energy Grasp</i>—This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i>, but differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or an enemy to effect the spell.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunthane">Sun Thane</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Thane (8 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes with this Discipline are able to command an animal to fall asleep at will. Some hostile animals may be able to resist this command, but most will be affected by it in some way. The duration of effect and the number of animals which can be affected at one time will increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this skill are able to conduct a Kai Exorcism. This ritual will banish any evil supernatural force that has taken possession of any goodly creature or object.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Thanes with this skill are able to protect themselves from the effects of being struck by natural electrical discharges, i.e. lightning.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to alter the temperature of water by touch. By using this skill they are able to transform water into ice and vice versa. The volume of water affected, and  the duration of effect, both increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to erect a special psychic defence called <i>Mindfort</i>. A <i>Mindfort</i> defence greatly reduces the effects of any psychic shock that would normally paralyse or weaken a lesser mortal.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Thane are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Slow Fall</i>—By casting this spell, Kai Sun Thanes are able to slow their rate of free-falling to three feet per second, thereby avoiding damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. The duration of the spell is limited at first, but it steadily increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Breathe Water</i>—Using this spell, a Kai Sun Thane is able to breathe underwater for ten minutes. The duration of effect increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Grand Master Disciplines will be noted in the <em>Improved Grand Master Disciplines</em> section of future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books.</p>

<p>Lord Rimoah removes a sphere of crystal from a pocket of his robe and holds it up to the lantern light. It is filled with a swirling grey mist. Softly he murmurs the words of an ancient spell and the mist clears to reveal the anxious face of your friend—Guildmaster Banedon. Rimoah speaks briefly to Banedon’s image, requesting that he come to the Monastery at once.</p>
<p><i>I will be with you within the hour,</i> says the voice of Banedon, a whisper in your mind.</p>
<p>Your friend is in Toran, sixty miles to the north, yet he holds true to his word. In less than an hour he arrives at the Monastery aboard <cite>Skyrider</cite>—his sleek flying ship. Two excited young Kai Aspirants bring word of his arrival to the vault and you respond by making your way swiftly to the surface. Banedon’s <cite>Skyrider</cite> is hovering above the training park, the hum of its magical engine amplified by the surrounding walls and battlements. It is dusk on this wintry evening and a shower of feathery snow is illuminated by the craft’s lanterns. A rope ladder hangs from the bow rail to the frost-hardened earth.</p>
<p>‘Go aboard, Grand Master,’ urges Rimoah. ‘Banedon will advise you and provide you with what you’ll be needing. I shall stay here and pray for your safe return.’</p>
<p>You bid a hasty farewell to your mentor before climbing the dangling rope ladder with the legendary speed and grace that sets you apart from lesser warriors. Banedon is waiting as you haul yourself aboard. He greets you with a glad smile, yet his face cannot hide his deep concern for what may await you in Ixia. You wave a final farewell to Lord Rimoah; then you retreat to the warmth of Banedon’s cabin as the <cite>Skyrider</cite> glides over the Monastery’s southern wall and ascends into the leaden sky.</p>
<p>Your friend Banedon has already set a course for Vadera, the principal city of Lencia, a destination which is more than a full day’s flight west of Sommerlund. Were this not the first stage of a longer voyage to Ixia you would gladly welcome the chance to visit Vadera, for you have many friends there in the court of King Sarnac of Lencia.</p>
<p>During the flight, Banedon details the plans which have been made on your behalf. King Sarnac himself has promised his help; he will provide you with a boat and a pilot to sail you from Vadera to Azgad Island, a desolate Lencian outpost in the Tozaz Sea. On your arrival there you will be transferred to a Lencian ice-boat, a craft specially built to withstand the power of the treacherous pack-ice which clings to the Ixian shoreline at this time of the year.</p>
<p>‘The ice-boat will land you on the coast of Ixia, Lone Wolf,’ says Banedon, ‘and then it will wait at anchor for you to return upon the completion of your mission.’</p>
<p>‘How long will the ice-boat wait for me?’ you ask, apprehensively.</p>
<p>‘If you do not return within seven days, the pilot has orders to set sail for Vadera without you. The Tozaz in winter is a cruel and terrible sea—no ordinary man could hope to survive there for much longer than a week, no matter how strong his ship or plentiful his supplies. Which reminds me—if you are to survive your visit to Deathlord Ixiataaga’s frigid realm, you will be needing some special protection.’</p>

<p>To your dismay, the descending wave of Lavas reach the Demonlord before you and form up in a protective circle around his ice-sheened body. Those that remain in the sky beat the air with their mighty wings, causing a powerful down-draught which holds you at bay.</p>
<p>Shielding your eyes from the stinging dust-choked winds, you look up and see that the Lavas leader is cradling the curious spiked metal bowl in its horny hands. He descends towards Tagazin and inverts it, and suddenly you realize its true purpose and design. It is a helm of power, affixed on top with a crystal spike. The Lavas places the helm upon the Demonlord’s head and the spike begins to glow menacingly.</p>
<p>Now all of the Lavas ascend into the sky where they wait to view a confrontation which is about to commence. Suddenly Tagazin, revitalized by the power of the spiked helm, comes charging at you with his head lowered, snorting gruffly like a maddened bull.</p>

<p>As you pass by the shimmering archway, you feel nausea rising from the pit of your stomach and a wave of dizziness makes you falter for a few moments: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, your dogged persistence pays off when you discover a partially-concealed panel in the wall. As you step nearer, it slides open to reveal a flight of steps which ascend to an empty chamber. Here you discover a door of opaque green crystal set flush into the north wall. Closer investigation reveals a curious lockplate positioned at its centre.</p>

<p>You mistime your jump and land badly, breaking your right leg in three places and rendering yourself incapable of moving. Gritting your teeth against the intense pain, you draw on your healing skills to mend the broken bones. Unfortunately, before your legs have healed sufficiently for you to go on, you are crushed to death by a deluge of falling masonry.</p>
<p>Your incredible courage has brought about the defeat of the evil Deathlord Ixiataaga, saving untold millions of living souls from an eternity of slavery in his service. So long as there is Good upon Magnamund you will never be forgotten. Sadly, though, death is the price you have paid for this victory.</p>

<p>There is a faint <i>click</i> and the door opens without a sound. You walk through and emerge into a chamber composed entirely of polished black crystal, where you see myriad images of yourself trailing away into infinity within the mirror-smooth walls. At first you see only your own reflections, but when you cast your gaze around this eerie chamber you realize that you are not alone. Standing guard at an open archway are a trio of undead creatures, the like of which you have never encountered before. They are armed with barbed tridents which they hold loosely in their corpse-green hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly they become aware of your presence and come scurrying forwards, their tridents raised in readiness to pin you to the wall.</p>

<p>Drawing on your Magnakai skills of camouflage and psychic defence to shield your body and mind, you leave your hiding place and hurry through the open archway. Several hundred yards beyond, you come to a wide stone staircase which ascends to a landing, positioned high above the underground lake and ice cavern. As you climb the steps, the sub-zero temperature plummets even further, making you shiver involuntarily, despite the combined protection of your Platinum Amulet and your Magnakai skills.</p>
<p>At length you reach the landing to be greeted by the sight of two undead Ixian warriors standing guard at the mouth of a cave. Instinctively, you sidestep into the shadows to avoid being seen, but the Ixians show no reactions; it is as if they have both been cast in stone.</p>
<p>Beyond the open cave mouth you see a bleak and desolate wasteland of rock and ice. A blizzard is raging, whipped up by a fierce electrical storm that blazes above a distant mountain range. The jagged peaks are illuminated by the flashes of the storm’s ghostly, blue-white fire.</p>
<p>Your Kai senses tell you that the evil sorcery which animates and controls the guards is temporarily dormant: these two skeletons currently pose no threat to your safety. However, the same cannot be said of the troop of undead Drakkarim warriors who, at this moment, are marching up the stairs behind you. Reluctantly, you leave the cave mouth and set off into the raging blizzard in search of the city of Xaagon.</p>

<p>You are on the threshold of unconsciousness when suddenly the light fades and you find yourself kneeling on a floor of black crystal, staring at the reflection of your pain-wracked face in its highly-polished surface.

<p>As you stare upwards at the monstrous spire, you detect waves of pure evil radiating from its ice-sheathed surfaces. They seem to wax and wane in time with the crimson light pulsing from its tip. Your improved mastery also detects dangerously high concentrations of light in the ultraviolet spectrum. So strong is this light that it physically sickens you, yet you find it hard to look away; you are both fascinated and repulsed by it.</p>

<p>With a dull <i>clunk</i>, the lock disengages and the heavy portal creaks ajar.<sup><a href="#sect10-1-foot" name="sect10-1">4</a></sup> Immediately you are greeted by a blast of frozen air as you push open the door and step out onto a viewing platform which is fixed to the outer metallic skin of this huge alien submarine. Away to your right you can see a line of ice-boats at anchor at the lake’s edge, and to your left you notice a column of skeletal warriors. These are being led by a black-robed Cabalah, marching in mechanical fashion along a jetty towards the mouth of a tunnel which leads out of the vast ice cavern. Your keen Kai senses tell you that you have arrived in Ixia, and that the distant tunnel leads to the surface.</p>
<p>You commit the position of the ice-boats to memory; if your mission is successful, you will be needing some means by which you can escape from Ixia. Then you carefully observe the area immediately surrounding the submarine, and notice that there are only two ways by which you can reach the distant tunnel—by the adjacent jetty, or by entering the icy waters of the lake and swimming to the shore.</p>

<p>You pilot the ship cautiously along a string of narrow fjords which cut an uncertain route through this treacherous field of icebergs. Using a mix of hand signals and telepathy, you send directions to the helmsman at the rear of the ship. It is a gruelling procedure which soon takes its toll on the nerves of all aboard.</p>
<p>Every few minutes your vision is obscured by gusts of powdery snow which swirl across the deck, blown down from the tops of the surrounding ice cliffs. During one of these fierce blasts you are momentarily blinded. You clasp your hands to your stinging eyes and suddenly the incessant howl of the wind is accompanied by the tortured screech of the hull as it shudders along a bank of submerged ice. The impact sends the ship careering violently to port and almost hurls you overboard. You crash heavily against the rail and rebound to the deck where you lie for a few moments, stunned and gasping for breath: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Mindful of the deadly danger, you scramble to your feet and rush to the prow. The crew have been clearly terrified by the collision; most of them are cowering along the ship’s rail, staring up at the encroaching walls of ice, their eyes haunted with fear as earnestly they offer prayers to the Goddess Ishir. Then, almost without any warning, the snow-laden wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg field into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea. The crew give a hearty cheer, relieved that their icy ordeal has at last come to an end. One man pulls the cork from a bottle of black rum which he has been keeping for a special occasion. He takes a mighty swig, and then passes it to you. Just as you are about to take a swallow, unexpectedly you hear the helmsman’s voice echoing along the deck: ‘Ship ahoy!’</p>
<p>Fear returns to tie a knot in your stomach as you turn and focus your eagle eyes upon the distant vessel.</p>

<p>You see that the Deathstaff is no longer vibrating with power.

It will be several minutes before the Deathstaff recoups its dark powers—you must act swiftly if you are to turn this to your advantage.</p>
<p>You raise the Sommerswerd and an umbrella of golden light bursts from its hilt to illuminate the debris-strewn chamber.</p>
<p>‘For Sommerlund and the Kai!’ you shout, and with a single mighty leap, you traverse the fiery moat and land on the plinth within an arm’s length of the Deathlord’s foul form. Your brave and bold action takes Ixiataaga aback, but he quickly recovers, and with unnerving speed, he spins around to counter your attack.</p>

<p>With difficulty you retrieve the Sabito from your Backpack and force it into your mouth. Your lungs feel as if they are on fire, and you are barely moments away from slipping into unconsciousness when the Sabito takes effect. Quickly the feelings of nausea subside and your strength returns. This prized herb enables your body to absorb oxygen from the icy seawater directly through the pores of your skin, negating the need to surface for air.</p>
<p>In just a few minutes you reach the distant shoreline and break through the surface alongside a shallow stone causeway. Atop this causeway is a track, a spur of which branches off towards the tunnel entrance. With only your head visible above the lake, you cling to the causeway stones and wait patiently for a patrol of undead warriors to march past.</p>

<p>Once again the freezing air is filled with cries of fear and chaos. Drawn by these frightful sounds, you run to the stone parapet and look down to see the great black ship come shuddering to a halt beside the harbour wall. Instantly, a horde of undead warriors leap onto the quayside and rush off in pursuit of the routing Lencians. Their eyes burn with an unnatural fire and they howl like demons as mercilessly they hunt down their human prey.</p>
<p>Prarg has now loaded the pantard and he calls on you to act as gunner. You oblige by taking hold of the firing mechanism and swivelling the weapon around in search of your first target. Two spring readily to view: the mass of undead that are swarming ashore, and a glowing glassy sphere which is mounted on a plinth beside the ship’s wheelhouse.</p>

<p>You stride over to Lanza and slap him heartily on the back. ‘Well fought, captain. You and your men have brought honour to Lencia this day.’</p>

<p>‘Well met, my lord,’ you say, and Ardan returns your greeting with a smile. Sadly, his smile soon fades when he says: ‘No doubt your able companion, Guildmaster Banedon, has told you of the rise of evil in Ixia.

<p>Quickly you make your way across the hall, zigzagging to dodge pillars, chunks of stone, and the many bodies of Ixiataaga’s former undead slave-warriors which are raining down from the shattered stairwell above. Assisted by your Kai Disciplines, eventually you reach the lowest level of the Crystal Spire where the entrance hall and grand arch open out into the city.

Above, you can hear the frenzied shouts of the Lencian crewmen as they are engaged by the undead Drakkarim in fierce hand-to-hand combat.

<p>Gradually, the storm lifts its heavy yoke. Although snow continues to fall, the wind loses its angry intensity, and for the first time since you left the cave mouth, you are able to see more than a mile distant. As you crest an icy ridge, you stop to get your bearings. You look to the south and see the brooding, grey-black waters of the Tozaz Sea lapping at the ice-locked Ixian coastline. To the north and west you are surrounded by unfriendly mountains, and to the east, directly ahead, lies a pass which cuts between two viciously sharp peaks. Beyond the pass you catch your first tantalising glimpse of Xaagon—the city of the Deathlord.</p>
<p>You establish that you are less than three miles from the crystal walls and monstrous towers of Xaagon. You resolve to try to reach the city before the storm resumes but, as you enter the pass, the blizzard returns with malicious vigour. Finding it impossible to continue, you stop and use your Kai skills in order to seek sanctuary from the raging storm.</p>

You rush to the end of the street and join them at a small flagstoned square, close to the harbour wall.</p>
<p>‘Captain—we must save the ice-boat!’ you shout, pointing to the ship which is being attacked by the skeleton horde. ‘Indeed we must,’ he replies, dourly. He orders a handful of his men to form a protective wall around you and, the moment their shields lock together, you move with them towards the ice-boat.</p>
<p>Twenty yards from the quayside, you break away from the wall and sprint towards the ship’s gangplank. You are halfway along the plank when you find yourself confronted by a wedge of skeletal warriors, armed with crude axes and swords. You leap into their midst, striking them down with blurring speed and deadly accuracy.

Stunned and helpless, it is only the speedy action of the crew which saves you from being crushed between the hull of the ship and the harsh, unyielding ice. With a noose of oiled rope, a couple of crewmen swiftly retrieve you from the sea and haul you back onto the deck. Dazed but undaunted, you free yourself from the rope and scramble back to the prow.</p>
<p>‘Hard a’port!’ you yell, waving frantically to the helmsman. He responds immediately, and within a few minutes the ship is free of the ice-bank and safe in deep water.</p>
<p>Some of the crew, clearly terrified by the collision and the subsequent sight of you falling overboard, are cowering along the ship’s rail like frightened puppies. They stare up at the encroaching walls of ice, their eyes full of fear as they pray feverishly to the Goddess Ishir to save their souls. Then, almost without any warning, the snowy wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg fjord into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea. As one, the crew give a hearty cheer, relieved that their ordeal has at last come to an end. One man pulls the cork from a bottle of black rum which he has been keeping for a special occasion. He takes a mighty swig, and then hands the frosted bottle to you. Just as you are about to take a swallow, unexpectedly you hear the helmsman’s voice echoing along the deck: ‘Ship ahoy!’</p>
<p>Fear returns to tie a knot in your stomach as you turn and focus your eagle eyes upon the distant vessel.</p>

Strange and intricate carvings decorate every inch of its coal-black timbers, and runic symbols embellish the metal plates which sheathe the hull forward of the mainmast. Calling upon your Kai senses, you determine that this vessel was not constructed by the unhuman creatures who crewed it, but that it is an ancient ship, built and crafted by a race of mariners who have long since disappeared into the mists of time. Closer examination of the timbers reveals it to be more than eleven thousand years old.</p>

A score of undead have clambered aboard the vessel and it is clear by their actions that they intend to destroy and sink it.</p>
<p>Determined to put a stop to their plan, you race into the hut, squeeze yourself through its solitary window, and then run headlong towards the stricken ship. You are halfway along the gangplank when you find yourself confronted by a wedge of skeletal warriors, each armed with a crude axe or sword.

As the tip of the Power Spike bites deep into the haft of Ixiataaga’s fell weapon, a hissing mass of crimson and white sparks explode into the air. These fiery motes are immediately sucked into the vortex of the Shadow Gate, which has now begun to whirl with alarming intensity.</p>

From its skull-face bulge three milky-white eyes, set above a lipless maw edged with dozens of barbed fangs. In its claw-like hand it clutches what appears to be a stalactite.

<p>‘In response to Lord Ardan’s request, I have made provision for your journey to Ixia, Grand Master,’ says the King, as the five of you gather around the map table. ‘As we speak, a man-o’-war is standing by in Vadera harbour, awaiting my order to set sail. Captain Prarg will accompany you during the first part of your sea voyage to our outpost, which is here on Azgad Island.’ King Sarnac points to the map, indicating a remote island near to the Gulf of Konkor.</p>

From there you must make your way on foot to the city of Xaagon, where you will find the Deathlord and his accursed weapon—the Deathstaff.’</p>

<p>Then, almost without any warning, the snow-laden wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg field into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea. The crew give a hearty cheer, relieved that their icy ordeal has at last come to an end. One man pulls the cork from a bottle of black rum which he has been keeping for a special occasion. He takes a mighty swig, and then passes it to a comrade. Just as the second man is raising the bottle to his lips, you hear unexpectedly the pilot’s voice echoing along the deck: ‘Ship ahoy!’</p>
<p>Fear returns to tie a knot in your stomach as you turn and focus your eagle eyes upon the distant vessel.</p>

Instead, you experience a sensation of falling, as if you are twirling and tumbling endlessly backwards into the heart of a white-hot sun.</p>

Standing guard at an open archway are a trio of undead creatures, the like of which you have never encountered before.

His posting here had been his punishment for a drunken brawl in a Vadera tavern in which he had killed, albeit in self-defence, the brutish elder son of Haglar, the mayor of the city. At his court-martial he had been allowed to choose his fate—command of the notorious Azgad Island garrison, or death by hanging. Lanza readily admits that there have been times when he has felt that he made the wrong choice.</p>

<p>In the tightening confines of this narrow fjord, it proves impossible for you to avoid a collision. With a shuddering crash, the port bow grounds on a submerged ridge of ice and is torn wide open. Within the hour, your ship sinks, leaving you stranded alone on the ice-field.</p>
<p>For three weeks you survive on the ice until, in the middle of one cold and stormy night, with your strength nearing its lowest ebb, you are swept into the sea, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>You can take some comfort in the fact that your incredible courage brought about the defeat of the evil Deathlord, saving untold millions from an eternity of slavery in his service. So long as there is Good upon Magnamund you will never be forgotten. Sadly, though, death is the price you have paid for this victory.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here in the Tozaz Sea.</p>

<p>The ghastly creature shrieks with undisguised glee as it prepares to strike you down. It raises its jagged rod of ice and sparks ignite at the tip—the prelude to another devastating blast of energy which the beast is about to aim at your crouching form. You reach for your own weapon, desperate to defend yourself, but as your hand closes around the hilt you hear the unexpected sound of rushing wind. Suddenly a spear-like missile hits the creature in the back and explodes from its chest. The impact sends the beast cartwheeling past you to slam into the ice-boat’s mast. You look towards the watchtower and see Prarg at the parapet, standing behind a catapult-like pantard, his clenched fist raised in triumph. You return his salute, thankful that his aim was true.</p>
<p>The pantard bolt has pinned the creature to the mast but it has not destroyed it. Howling with anger, it twists and writhes to get free. Then, as if drawn by its unhuman cries, a mass of skeletal warriors come charging down the gangplank towards you. Instinctively, you draw your weapon and strike the plank a mighty blow, splitting it cleanly in two. Both sections collapse and the onrushing skeletons tumble helplessly into the icy water.</p>

Fortunately, as you reach the shallows, the creature is forced to abandon its pursuit and let you escape. Coughing and retching violently, you stagger out of the icy water and stumble to the cover of some boulders which lie embedded in the shore.

<p>With your briefing now concluded, King Sarnac ushers you all into his court chamber. There you bid him, Lord Ardan, and Guildmaster Banedon farewell, and they in turn wish you good luck and godspeed before Captain Prarg escorts you to the harbour. It is snowing heavily, and few of Vadera’s inhabitants notice as the two of you are welcomed aboard the <cite>Maycastle</cite>, the square-rigged man-o’-war which will carry you to Azgad Island.</p>
<p>You leave Vadera within the hour and begin the long, cold voyage northwards. During the voyage, Captain Prarg tells you about the raids which have destroyed several small Drakkarim settlements along the Gulf of Konkor and the coast of the Shakoz Bight. On the twelfth day of your two-week sea journey, you catch a glimpse of one such settlement, near to the mouth of the River Lenag. All that remains is a wispy pall of smoke which hangs above the burnt-out hovels, darkening an already stormy sky.</p>
<p>For most of the voyage, a host of seabirds have accompanied the <cite>Maycastle</cite>, attracted by the scraps of food regularly thrown out by the ship’s galley. But at dawn on the thirteenth day, as the ship enters the Gulf of Konkor, the usual flocks of shrieking gulls are nowhere to be seen. It is as if they have suddenly become aware of impending danger and have turned back, eager to stay out of harm’s reach. Later in the day, a fierce squall arises from the east which whips the iron-grey waters of the gulf into a maelstrom. The crew fight desperately to control their ship as the storm rages all day and all night, not abating until dawn of the following day. As the wind gradually dies and the sea settles, the lookout is able to resume his post atop the mainmast.</p>

<p>‘Land ahoy!’ he cries, and all eyes scan the northern vista. There, perched on the wintry horizon, is a grey strip of barren, frost-covered rock. You magnify your vision and see, on the western side of this island, a few slate buildings clustered around a fortified stone tower.</p>
<p>‘That’s Fort Azgad,’ says Captain Prarg, with relief in his voice. ‘At last we’ve arrived.’</p>

<p>At the first opportunity you sprint away from the wooden crates and descend the staircase to a closed door. It is a sturdy portal, carved from solid rock and banded with strips of bronze. You test it with the toe of your boot and, to your surprise, it swings open with barely a sound.</p>
<p>Beyond the door lies a rough-hewn chamber lined with racks of ancient crystal spears and swords. Despite the millennia which have passed since they were crafted by armourers during the Age of Eternal Night, these weapons still hold a keen edge and gleam like new.</p>

<p>The portal begins to shimmer and lose its solidity. At first it becomes transparent and then it fades completely, as if evaporating into thin air. With a smile of satisfaction on your lips at having overcome it, you step through the now-open archway and into an adjoining hall.</p>
<p>This vaulted, oblong-shaped hall is illuminated by flickerings of electrical fire which arc between two freestanding pillars at the far end of the chamber. Beyond the pillars you can make out the shadowy entrance to another chamber; it is the only other exit from this hall. You realize at once that to pass between the pillars could prove to be fatal: the power arcing between them is as great as any lightning storm raging in the skies above Xaagon. Yet there may be a way of avoiding contact with this raw power. You notice that the two freestanding pillars do not go all the way to the ceiling—there is a gap at the top, a little over two feet wide.</p>

<p>With trepidation you steer the ship along a string of narrow fjords which cut an uncertain route through this treacherous field of icebergs. Your hands, slick with nervous sweat, grip the wheel tightly and inch it back and forth in response to the pilot’s frantic signals. It is a gruelling ordeal which soon takes its toll on the nerves of all aboard.</p>
<p>Every few minutes your vision is obscured by gusts of powdery snow which swirl across the deck, blown down from the tops of the surrounding ice cliffs. One of these fierce blasts temporarily blinds you. As you fight to restore your vision, the incessant howl of the wind is suddenly accompanied by the tortured screech of the ship’s hull as it collides with a ridge of submerged ice. The impact sends the vessel careering violently to starboard and hurls you painfully against the wheelhouse wall: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>The instant you set foot inside the cave entrance, you hear a noise which makes you freeze in your tracks. A ghastly half-gibbering, half-growling sound issues from the dark recesses of the cave—a warning from the creature which dwells here that you are not a welcome visitor. You scan the inky darkness and see the glint of two yellow eyes as they emerge from a fold in the rock wall. Slowly the eyes advance. You use your ability to see in the infrared spectrum of light, in order to discern the outline of this shadowy creature, but it is to no avail. You can detect no heat patterns. The reason for this is simple—the creature now advancing towards you gives off no heat because, like everything else in this wretched land, it is already dead.</p>

<p>The creature turns its icy rod around and points the blunt end towards your head. There is a brilliant flash of light and a guttering ball of flame comes speeding from the base of the rod towards your face. Your reflexes save you—you dive for cover behind a tool chest and the fireball whistles over your head to explode into the decking. Howling with anger, the creature launches a second fireball, but this one is not aimed at you—it is targeted at the ice-boat’s waterline.

<p>As the last skeletal warrior crumbles beneath your repeated blows, you step back and wipe the sweat of battle from your brow. A glance into the secret panel through which they emerged reveals a narrow chamber beyond. Lying on the crystal slab floor you see several items of equipment:</p>

<p>Silently you climb the stairs and peer over the lip of the hatch; you are just in time to witness a scene which shocks you to the core. You see that the undead Drakkarim warriors have slain all of the Lencian crewmen and have heaped their bodies around the base of the mainmast. One of the undead, clad in a filthy grey cloak embroidered with alien symbols, utters a chilling liturgy over the corpses of the slain. You sense something is very wrong. The chill air crackles with power and sparks of evil energy whirl around their bodies. When at last the liturgy ends, you see to your horror the slain Lencians rise up and take their places alongside the Drakkarim undead.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration IX]</div>
<p>Revolted and angered by what you have witnessed, you vow to avenge the souls of the crew and draw your weapon in readiness to attack the host of Drakkarim undead. But before you can act, you feel a shudder run through the deck. The great vessel which has swallowed your ship is lurching to a halt. There is a dull boom, and then several portals open in the surrounding walls of the host vessel, spilling beams of white light across the deck of your captive ship. Scores of Drakkarim undead emerge from these portals and descend upon the ship like a host of hungry ghouls. You are forced to abandon your plan for vengeance—there are now far too many of the enemy. Yet all is not lost. In the milling confusion, you seize an opportunity to get away from the ship and escape into one of the light-filled portals.</p>

Fearing discovery, you leap from the rear of the moving wagon and hide yourself among a stack of empty wooden crates.

<p>Leaning at a slant to make headway into the blizzard, you trek determinedly through deep snow that is heaped in drifts around the breached city wall. As you pass through the gap, you catch brief glimpses of ruined buildings through the sleeting gale. You also become aware of a noise—a low hum—which is reverberating beneath the howl of the wind. You stop to listen and at once you determine that this strange noise is coming from the Crystal Spire.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration X]</div>
<p>Wearily you press on through the awesome ruins of this age-old city, where once a proud and mighty race reigned supreme, until you are forced to halt and take cover from a passing troop of skeletal warriors. You watch them march stiffly along an ice-choked avenue towards a plaza which is dominated by a frozen fountain. Beyond the fountain’s solid plume of water you see a broad ramp which ascends to a grand archway at the base of the Crystal Spire.</p>

<p>Banedon reaches for a small wooden box which lies half-buried on a shelf, amongst a clutter of scrolls and charts. As he does so, he is momentarily distracted by the Platinum Amulet which you wear on a cord around your neck. You notice the suddenly inquisitive look in his eye.</p>
<p>‘How did you come by that?’ he asks, as he stares fixedly at the amulet.</p>
<p>‘It was given to me by Gwynian—the Sage of Varetta. I’m sure its powers kept me safe from the perils of the Maakengorge. Tell me, my friend, have you heard of this sage?’</p>
<p>‘Oh yes,’ replies Banedon, thoughtfully, ‘I know Gwynian. If the amulet you wear was given to you by him then, perhaps, you do not need the special protection I had in mind after all.’</p>
<p>Banedon takes the small wooden box and hands it to you. Upon opening it you discover it contains a platinum amulet, almost identical to the one you are already wearing.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the air crackles and seethes with static power. A dark shape is taking form at the centre of the raging cyclone, a shape which radiates an intense aura of evil. It solidifies into a tall, black-robed torso surmounted by a goat-like skull. Where there should be eye sockets you see fiery cores of scarlet energy. Fear grips you with its icy hand when you smell the stench of death and corruption that hangs heavy around this dread being. You are in no doubt that you are now in the presence of the Deathlord of Ixia.</p>
<p>Tagazin whimpers like a frightened pup and slinks towards his master, his head bowed in fearful subservience. The Deathlord removes the Deathstaff from inside his funereal robe and holds it on high. Tagazin freezes in his tracks and his whole body trembles violently—he is clearly petrified of his master’s wrath.

<p>You are dazed and bruised but otherwise unharmed, the glancing blow and your Magnakai skill of Nexus having spared you the worst effects of the deadly bolt.

<p>When you regain consciousness, it seems as if you have been knocked out for no more than a few minutes, but as your mind clears you sense that you are still at sea, although no longer in the hold of the Ixian ice-boat. Countless hours, perhaps even days, could have elapsed since you were knocked out, and now you find yourself lying face down on the floor of a small dank cell. Instinctively you reach for your weapon—but it is no longer there. Your head throbs, your body aches viciously, and your mood is further soured when you discover that your Backpack, your Weapons, and all of your Special Items (with the exception of your Platinum Amulet) are missing.</p>
<p>You roll over wearily and drag yourself to your feet.

<p>As your divine blade inflicts the wounds which destroy these creatures, their bodies undergo a swift and gruesome transformation. They implode, twisting and shrinking as they contract, until all that is left are three evil-smelling pools of bubbling black venom surrounded by melted ice and fragments of smouldering cloth.</p>
<p>You sheathe the Sommerswerd and step away from the foul remains. But as you turn to leave the ruins, you hear a terrifying howl that makes your blood run cold. With fearful anticipation you look up at the towering Crystal Spire and see, illuminated by lightning flashes, the awesome figure of Deathlord Ixiataaga. He stands behind the parapet of a window in the upper reaches of the spire, the Deathstaff raised high in his ungodly hand. He has sensed the presence of the Sommerswerd and he has determined to destroy it.</p>
<p>You see a flash of white light explode at the tip of the Deathstaff, and in the very next instant, you feel agonizing pain shoot through every part of your body.

<p>The dingy, ice-caked corridor wends its way deeper into the bowels of this vast alien vessel. You explore a maze of empty holds, where the walls are braced with gleaming crystal girders, and pass through low-ceilinged chambers that, despite the biting chill, reek of death and decay. At length your search ends at a great grey door which is guarded by two undead Drakkarim warriors, armed with spears.

<p>Shielding your eyes from the stinging dust-choked wind, you look up to see that one of the winged creatures is cradling a curious item in its horny hands, an item which radiates an intense aura of evil power.

In his bony hand he clutches a rod which hums with the power contained within its silvery haft. He had intended to use its power on you, to extract details of your mission, but the swiftness of your attack has preempted this. The skeletal being shrieks with anger as you wrestle the rod from his grasp. Suddenly, a blast of red-hot fire erupts from its tip, carving a fist-sized chunk of stone from the cell wall.

You realize at once that to pass between the pillars could prove to be fatal: the power arcing between them is as great as any lightning storm raging in the skies above Xaagon. Yet there may be a way of avoiding contact with this raw power.

You magnify your vision and see that its main deck is completely enclosed by a canopy of overlapping green-grey timbers, affording it the appearance of some gigantic fish. Two glassy portholes and a jagged line which stretches around its prow complete this chilling illusion.</p>
<p>For its shape and size it moves towards your ship at an unnatural speed. You call the crew to arms, fearing it to be an enemy vessel closing to attack, and you sense a shudder run through them when, for the first time, they clearly discern its alien design. You focus your Kai senses upon the oncoming craft and suddenly you realize its purpose. It is an Ixian vessel, come to rendezvous with your ship, believing it still to be manned by the undead horde which attacked Fort Azgad.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XII]</div>
<p>‘Stand firm!’ you shout, attempting to rally the nervous Lencians as the craft speeds ever nearer. When less than a hundred yards distant, its great prow begins to creak open. It is as if you are looking into the ghastly maw of a hungry sea predator. The fearful sight alarms the Lencian crew and they flee towards the bow of the ship in panic: ‘Save us!’ they cry. ‘Ishir save us! It’s going to eat us alive!’</p>

<p>You flee the chamber, escaping past many Ixian and Drakkarim guards who stand rigidly immobile, fixed in the poses and attitudes they were in the very moment you vanquished the Deathlord. It was his power which gave them un-life; now that power is no more.</p>
<p>Fearing for your survival, you sprint across heaving, buckling slabs of broken stone that were once smooth tiled floors, and rush down staircases that crack and twist beneath your feet. You are racing down one such stairwell when suddenly an entire section collapses, leaving a gaping hole more than fifty feet deep. Above you, a row of pillars topple like storm-shaken trees, blocking the stairs completely, and making it impossible for you to retrace your steps.</p>

<p>You trudge stoically through the snow and ice towards the distant circle of rocks, hoping all the while that they will afford you some protection from this incessant blizzard. When you are within a few dozen yards of the circle, you hear a deafening <i>crack!</i> which sets your pulse racing. With that split-second warning, a huge expanse of rock and ice breaks away from the slopes above and swiftly transforms itself into a thundering avalanche. Wide-eyed with horror, you watch as a million tons of ice, snow, and shale comes rumbling down the mountainside towards you.</p>
<p>Galvanized into action, you turn and run from this deadly white wall of destruction. It is almost upon you when you see a low shelf of rock near the base of the pass, and desperately you dive for cover beneath it.</p>

<p>Outside of this vessel is a vast subterranean lake enclosed within a titanic cavern of ice. Several ice-boats, similar to the one on which you set sail from Fort Azgad, are moored in a long line at the lake’s edge. Scores of undead warriors attend to these ships, and many more can be seen marching along the frosty walkways which go all around the lake’s shoreline.</p>
<p>Quickly you realize that these ships are part of a great invasion fleet. Constructed by the slaves of Deathlord Ixiataaga, they can only have been built for one purpose—to carry his armies of undead warriors to the lands of the living. Rimoah and Ardan were correct—the Deathlord does intend to wage a bloody war upon Magnamund—yet even their gloomiest predictions failed to estimate just how advanced his plans are.</p>
<p>Shocked by the revelation of your discovery, you reaffirm your vow to thwart the Deathlord’s monstrous scheme. You move away from the porthole and hurry along the hallway in search of a way out of this alien submarine.</p>

<p>The howling winds of the void rip at your face and clothing as you plummet into the core of the lightless abyss. You lose all sense of time until, in the remote distance, you see tiny motes of light come streaking towards your face. Then, as suddenly as it began, the sensation of falling through deep space is replaced by an abrupt cessation of movement.</p>
<p>Stunned and disorientated, you shake your head and rise uneasily to your feet. As your blurred vision clears, you see that you have returned to the chamber of the Crystal Spire from where you were first sent tumbling into the Shadow Gate. It is empty now. Fearing the worst, you use your Kai skills to determine the time and the date. To your immediate relief you discover that only a few hours have elapsed during your absence from Magnamund; it is still possible for you to achieve your quest.</p>
<p>You resolve to find the Deathlord, even if it means searching every chamber of the Crystal Spire. You turn to leave this hall, but a noise behind you makes you freeze in your tracks. The sudden stench of decay and corruption tells you that you may not have to look too far to find your adversary after all.</p>

<p>Your Kai Mastery warns you that you have inadvertently triggered a silent alarm. You unsheathe your weapon and turn to leave this rubble-strewn chamber, but as you move towards the stairs you hear a sound that makes you spin on your heel: it is the grating rumble of stone on stone.</p>
<p>From out of a secret panel in the wall to your left come six skeletal warriors, each one brandishing a rust-pitted sword. They make no sound, yet their eye sockets are aglow with sorcerous fire as they rush across the chamber towards you.</p>

<p>The portal begins to shimmer and lose its solidity. At first it becomes transparent and then it fades completely, as if evaporating into thin air. With a smile of satisfaction on your lips at having overcome it, you step through the now-open archway and into an adjoining hall.</p>
<p>This vaulted, oblong-shaped hall is illuminated by flickerings of electrical fire which arc between two freestanding pillars at the far end of the chamber.</p>
<p>Beyond the pillars you can make out the shadowy entrance to another chamber; it is the only other exit from this hall. You realize at once that to pass between the pillars could prove to be fatal: the power arcing between them is as great as any lightning storm raging in the skies above Xaagon. Yet there may be a way of avoiding contact with this raw power. You notice that the two freestanding pillars do not go all the way to the ceiling—there is a gap at the top, a little over two feet wide.</p>

<p>The dozen or so Lavas surrounding the ailing Tagazin appear to be urging him on towards the Shadow Gate. Your hopes of returning to your home world rose when first you saw the Shadow Gate, but now the familiar sensation of fear returns to chill your blood. The thought occurs to you that if Tagazin should enter the Shadow Gate before you, the Lavas may be able to close it behind him and deny you the chance of escaping from this evil domain. It is a risk you cannot afford to take.</p>
<p>Drawing your weapon, you race along the track in pursuit of the Demonlord, grimly determined to prevent him from reaching the Shadow Gate alive.</p>

<p>As you stumble away from the cave mouth, you look back over your shoulder to see the mysterious creature illuminated momentarily by a flash of lightning. The sight is chilling to behold. From the creature’s huge, bear-like body there writhes a score of slimy tentacles, and from the top of its reptilian head there protrudes a twisted horn, longer than a broadsword. It gives a loud gibbering howl of victory before returning to its evil-smelling lair.</p>
<p>Denied shelter in the cave, you return to the bottom of the pass and seek cover among the circle of rocks which lie on the southern face. When you are within a few dozen yards of the circle, you hear a deafening <i>crack!</i> which sets your pulse racing.

<p>Less than fifty yards away you see a shaggy, grey-furred beast of burden which is harnessed to a wooden wagon. A troop of undead soldiers is unloading shiny metallic containers from the back of this wagon which they then carry, cradled in their bony arms, into the open mouth of the submarine.</p>
<p>Stealthily, you make your way closer to the wagon and await the chance to climb aboard as soon as the final container has been off-loaded. At last the opportunity arrives; you leap aboard and hide yourself from sight beneath a greasy, foul-smelling tarpaulin.</p>
<p>After a few minutes you feel a jolt as the wagon moves off. Through a crack in its ancient wooden planks, you watch with trepidation as the wagon trundles along a causeway towards the distant tunnel entrance. It enters the tunnel, unchallenged by the skeletal warriors who stand guard here, and ascends a gentle gradient to another ice-walled cavern. Several passages connect here from all directions, like the spokes of a giant wheel converging at the hub.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XIII]</div>
<p>An undead Drakkarim soldier steps forward, takes hold of the shaggy beast’s harness, and leads the wagon towards a stockpile of metallic containers. Clearly he intends to load these onto the wagon for transportation back to the submarine. Fearing discovery, you leap from the rear of the moving wagon and hide yourself among a stack of empty wooden crates. From here you observe two possible ways by which you could leave this busy cavern: by an unguarded staircase in the north wall, or through an open archway in the east wall.</p>

Then it crumples to the icy ground, its body transforming swiftly into an evil-smelling pool of bubbling black venom.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Cabalah seems to weaken the attacking horde. They falter, and Lanza’s men seize the opportunity to counterattack. You rush forward and join them as they fight their way valiantly back towards the quay.</p>
<p>‘Look there, Grand Master!’ shouts Lanza, pointing to the ice-boat. A score of undead have clambered aboard the vessel and it is clear by their actions that they intend to destroy and sink it.</p>
<p>‘They must be stopped!’ you cry. You break free from the battle and run headlong towards the stricken ship. You are halfway along its gangplank when you find yourself confronted by a wedge of skeletal warriors, armed with crude axes and swords.</p>
<p>You leap into their midst, striking them down with blurring speed and deadly accuracy. As the last one falls, its corpse-like body almost severed at the waist, you hear a noise behind you which makes you spin around in fearful expectation.</p>

<p>You sheathe your weapon and step away from the foul-smelling mounds of dust. But as you go to leave, you discover that the open archway that these creatures were guarding when you first arrived in this chamber is now sealed. You approach the solid sheet of opaque green crystal and examine an intricate lockplate which is set in the centre of its mirror-smooth surface. It is a lock of ancient design, one which operates by psychic energy. You study the intricate patterns which embellish it and gradually you realize that they give clues to a two-digit number. By projecting the image of this number at the lock, using your psychic powers, you will release the locking mechanism and cause the portal to open.</p>
<p>The first of the two numbers is equal to the number of islands which lie within 150 miles to the west of Xaagon.</p>

As the blade of the sun-sword bites the haft of Ixiataaga’s fell weapon, a hissing mass of crimson and gold sparks explode into the air. These fiery motes are sucked into the vortex of the Shadow Gate, which has now begun to whirl with alarming intensity.</p>

You look up to see that one of the winged creatures is cradling a curious item in his horny hands, an item which radiates an intense aura of evil power. At first glance it resembles a large metal bowl with a sharp spear of crystal fixed to its underside, but when the Lavas descends towards Tagazin and inverts it, you suddenly realize its true purpose and design. It is a helm of power, affixed with a crystal spike. The Lavas place the helm upon the Demonlord’s head and the spike begins to glow menacingly.</p>

<p>‘Give me your Weapon, Grand Master,’ says Banedon, holding out his hand expectantly. You unsheathe your hand-weapon and pass it to him hilt-first. From a pocket he takes out a dull red gem, no bigger than a fig stone, and presses it gently against the hilt of your Weapon. To your surprise, you see the gem sink into the hilt as easily as if Banedon were pressing it into a pat of warm butter.</p>
<p>‘The gem is a Dessi Stone,’ says Banedon, in answer to your unspoken question. ‘Lord Rimoah gave it to me. Now, I give it to you.

<p>You take the ship’s wheel and turn this alien vessel out of the narrow harbour, into the roiling waters of the Tozaz Sea. It is less than an hour past noon and yet the winter night has already closed in. You share the icy darkness with a crew of six Lencian outposters, all of whom have volunteered for this perilous mission. Lanza has ordered them to land you on the coast of Ixia and wait at anchor for seven days for you to return; they must wait no longer.</p>
<p>With ten miles of sea behind you, you hand over the wheel to one of the crew and settle down on the wheelhouse floor to sleep. But you have barely closed your eyes when the deck begins to buck like a stallion. The ship has sailed directly into a <i xml:lang="">saesha</i>—a sudden and violent sea-storm for which the Tozaz is infamous. Thunder roars and sleet blows with blinding ferocity as the ship dips and rolls in the waves.</p>
<p>After what seems like an eternity, the ship emerges from the storm—a storm against which few craft other than this could have sailed. The darkness gives way to an eerie dawn which casts its watery light upon a new danger. In the grey half-light you see thousands of icebergs ahead, stretching across the horizon as far as the eye can see. Your heart sinks—navigating a course through this icy maze could well prove impossible.</p>

<p>The dozen or so winged creatures that surround the ailing Tagazin appear to be urging him on towards the Shadow Gate. Your hopes of returning to your home world rose when first you saw the whirling vortex, but now a familiar sensation of fear returns to chill your blood. The thought occurs to you that if Tagazin should enter the Shadow Gate before you, the dragon-creatures may be able to close it behind him and deny you the chance of ever escaping from this evil domain. It is a risk you cannot afford to take.</p>

At first the alien cries of your pursuers sound hungry and frantic, like those of a ravenous pack of starving wolves denied their prey, but suddenly you realize that they are not cries of hunger at all—they are howls of glee.

<p>The great alien vessel looms towards your ship, its jaw-like prow hinged open as if in readiness to bite you in half. Then, with stunning swiftness, your entire craft is consumed by this onrushing vessel, swallowed up in its great jaws. There is a moment of deadly silence. Then, in the morbid, greenish gloom, you hear a bubbling rush of icy water echoing through the vast depths of this gullet. With fearful anticipation you unsheathe your weapon, move towards the ship’s rail, and then look down. The surrounding seawater is fast draining away, leaving your ship dry-docked upon a long, V-shaped plinth which glistens like polished bone. The bubbling subsides, to be replaced by another noise—the sound of a great portal grinding open. Bright light streams across the deck, blazing down from an archway which is opening close to the starboard bow. Silhouetted in this light are a hundred moving forms, each man-sized and armed with a sword or a spear. A ghastly howl of anger arises from their ranks when they see unexpectedly that the ship is crewed by living men. As the first of their number leap from the arch and crash upon the deck, you recognize their form. Once these creatures were Drakkarim warriors; now they are undead slaves in the service of the Ixian Deathlord.

<p>The moment you draw your divine blade, the bodies of your attackers undergo a swift and gruesome transformation.

They barely have time to cry out in agony as their twisted remains hit the floor and crumble to dust.</p>
<p>You sheathe the Sommerswerd and step away from the foul-smelling mounds of dust. But as you turn towards the archway that these fell creatures were guarding, you are confronted by a terrifying sight. Framed in the archway is the awesome figure of Deathlord Ixiataaga himself, the Deathstaff raised high in his ungodly hand. He has sensed the presence of the Sommerswerd and he has come to destroy it. Stunned by his awful visage, you fail to react in time to save yourself. You see a flash of white light explode at the tip of the staff and, in the very next instant, you feel agonizing pain shoot through every part of your body. Then an explosion of white-hot fire obliterates your senses and, in a terrifying instant, the light that is your life is snuffed out.</p>

<p>You advance slowly along the slippery foredeck towards steps which ascend to the raised stern of this alien vessel. Every inch of its coal-black timbers is decorated with strange and intricate carvings, and archaic symbols embellish the metal rails which encircle its gunwales. Drawing on your Grand Master Disciplines, you determine that this vessel was not constructed by the unhuman creatures who crewed it, but that it is an ancient ship, built and crafted by a race of mariners who have long since disappeared into the mists of time. Closer examination of the timbers reveals it to be more than eleven thousand years old.</p>
<p>You climb to the wheelhouse, which stands in the centre of the stern deck, and discover there a large, glassy sphere mounted upon an ornate base of glittering black stone. A low hum and a faint greenish glow radiate from this sphere, which in turn is connected by silver tubes and strands of braided metal to the wheel which steers the craft. After careful study of the controls you feel confident that you could sail the vessel.</p>
<p>Prarg enters the wheelhouse and announces that, having thoroughly searched the bow and below deck areas, he is sure that it is empty—no hidden enemies are lurking aboard.</p>
<p>‘Well, Grand Master,’ he continues, staring bemusedly at the strange workings of this craft, ‘this is a rum craft and no mistake. Are you sure it can carry you to Ixia?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I’m sure,’ you reply. ‘In fact I’m certain that it will be safer to sail the Tozaz in this ship than to attempt the crossing in any ice-boat bearing the Lencian flag.’</p>
<p>Prarg looks out of the wheelhouse window at the sunken remains of the ice-boat, and says: ‘I hope you’re right, Grand Master. I sincerely hope you’re right.’</p>

<p>With the hideous gibbering shrieks of the Chaos-creatures echoing in your ears, you hurry down the slime-smeared steps into the claustrophobic depths of this sunken building. At first the alien cries of your pursuers sound hungry and frantic, like those of a ravenous pack of starving wolves, but suddenly you realize that they are not cries of hunger at all—they are howls of glee. The Chaos-creatures are enjoying the sight of you rushing headlong to your doom!</p>
<p>You skid to a halt but it is already too late. With chilling abruptness, the slimy stairs open up and you fall feet-first into a deep, dark pit.</p>

<p>As the first line of screeching Drakkarim hurl themselves forwards, you advance to meet their attack, your weapon dealing them destruction in a wide arc. Resistance meets your weapon’s keen edge, though it is not the touch of armour or flesh. Your powerful blows shear through Drakkarim bodies with the sickening feel of clinging jelly. It is as if you are fighting against a horde of bloodless phantoms possessed of a rubbery strength in their rotting, wasted limbs. The first line falls, but a second is poised ready to throw itself upon you with a mindless fury.</p>

<p>Your Kai Mastery warns you that the rod is ready to discharge another blast of energy. If you touch this sorcerous weapon, it is you who will be the victim of the blast.</p>
<p>Aware of the danger, you quickly pull your hand away. Instead of retrieving the rod, you change direction and barge your way head-first through the skeletal warriors who are blocking the door. The speed of your action leaves them sprawled helplessly on the ground and, by the time they have untangled themselves and staggered to their feet, you are nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>You escape along a dark corridor and, when you are sure that you are not being followed, you pause for a few moments to use your Magnakai skill of Nexus in an attempt to determine the location of your missing weapons and equipment. You sense they are not too distant and, guided by your intuition, you go off along an adjoining passageway in search of them.</p>
<p>The dingy, ice-caked tunnel wends its way deeper into the bowels of this vast alien vessel. You explore a series of empty holds, where the walls are braced with gleaming crystal girders, and pass through low-ceilinged chambers that, despite the biting chill, reek of death and decay. At length your search ends at a great grey door which is guarded by two undead Drakkarim warriors, armed with spears. The noises you heard during your time in the cell have now ceased, and so has the movement of the vessel; you sense that this craft is no longer at sea.</p>

<p>Before the sundered remains of your enemies can merge and reform, you kick them into the pit where they are consumed by the creatures which lurk at the bottom of its slime-filled base. Then, without looking back, you make a swift escape up to the roof and hurry away along the mossy ridge.</p>
<p>Minutes later, you come to a thicket of mist-enshrouded trees. As you pass through this eerie wood, you detect the presence of Tagazin once more. Fresh tracks indicate his direction and determinedly you set off, finding it an easy task to follow his clawed footprints in the loamy soil. They lead you through a tangle of saw-toothed briar and up a gently sloping rise. As you crest the top of the rise, you look upon an awe-inspiring sight.</p>

<h3><a name="sect264">264</a></h3>

<p>You follow Captain Lanza as he races down to the base of the watchtower and hurries off along the slate-cobbled avenue which leads directly to the harbour. As he runs he curses and barks orders at the garrison soldiers who are fleeing from the quay, but they are wide-eyed with terror and all appear deaf to his commands. As you reach a bend in the road, you see the great black ship shuddering to a halt alongside the harbour wall. Instantly, a horde of undead warriors leap onto the quay and come rushing in pursuit of the routing Lencians. Their eyes burn with an unnatural fire and they howl like unchained demons as they mercilessly hunt their human prey.</p>
<p>Lanza manages to rally a dozen of his best men to form a defensive line across the narrow avenue. With their shields overlapping and their swords poised ready to thrust, they brace themselves to receive the first wave of undead. The pugnacious captain shouts words of encouragement to stave off their fear but it is clear to you that every single one of them is terrified. Their faces are drenched with sweat despite the biting cold.</p>
<p>With a hideous howl, the advancing mass of undead fall upon their line, hacking and stabbing at their shield-wall with their rust-dulled blades. The Lencians fight back furiously, shattering bones and cleaving skulls, but they are forced to give ground before the pressing onslaught.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XVI]</div>
<p>Then, from the midst of the enemy ranks, a grisly creature clad in mouldering black robes comes bursting through the shield-wall. A Lencian turns to thrust his sword into the creature’s wormy flesh. His attack releases a gout of venom and instantly his sword crumples—corroded by the foul blood. The venom splashes him and he falls screaming to the ground, clutching at the smouldering stump that was once his hand. The creature howls with malicious glee as it leaps over his writhing body. It rushes towards you, its eye sockets blazing and its black claws extended to rake your flesh.</p>

You writhe in agony as gravity releases its hold on your body, and you feel yourself begin to rise: lose 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>You are on the threshold of unconsciousness when suddenly the light fades and you find yourself kneeling on a floor of black crystal, staring at the reflection of your pain-wracked face in its highly-polished surface. Wearily you raise your aching head and see, to your horror, a trio of undead creatures scurrying towards you from an open archway.

<p>Determinedly you battle your way through deepening snow and sleeting crosswinds to reach the remnants of Xaagon’s west gate. This once-magnificent portal lies scattered in pieces around the open archway of a twin-towered barbican. As you approach the arch, you catch brief glimpses of the city’s ruined buildings through the driving sleet. You also become aware of a noise—a low hum—reverberating beneath the howl of the wind. You pause briefly to listen and determine at once that this strange noise comes from the direction of the Crystal Spire.</p>
<p>Warily you press on towards the barbican, your eyes peeled all the while for guards. You are within a few yards of the archway when suddenly your Kai Sixth Sense alerts you to danger. Moments later, a dozen undead Drakkarim warriors come looming out of the storm, marching two abreast towards the west gate arch. To avoid detection you quickly sidestep into a shadowy portal at the base of the barbican wall. Here you discover a flight of stone steps which ascend to a derelict chamber that once served as a guardroom.</p>

Its concussive vibration is so strong that it leaves ripples in the snow.</p>
<p>You crane your neck to look at the uppermost tip of the spire, and you shiver with dread when you detect the unmistakable presence of the Deathlord. His cloying aura of evil makes you break out in a cold sweat, but you fight back this fear and resolve to gain entry to the Crystal Spire; you are determined to defeat him.

<p>You climb out of the forward hold and hurry along the deck to a flight of steps which ascend to the raised stern. A wheelhouse stands in the centre of the stern deck, inside of which you find Prarg examining a large glassy sphere mounted upon an ornate base of glittering black stone. A low hum and a faint greenish glow radiate from this sphere, which in turn is connected by silver tubes and strands of braided metal to the wheel which steers the craft.</p>
<p>‘What do you make of this, Grand Master?’ says Prarg, inviting you to take a closer look. You inspect the devices and determine them to be the propulsion and steering mechanisms. After careful appraisal of the controls you determine that you could easily sail the vessel.</p>
<p>‘Well, Grand Master,’ he says, staring bemusedly at the strange workings of this ship, ‘this is a rum craft and no mistake. Are you sure it can carry you to Ixia?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I’m sure,’ you reply. ‘In fact I’m certain that it will be safer to sail the Tozaz in this ship than to attempt a crossing in any ice-boat bearing the Lencian flag.’</p>
<p>Prarg looks out of the wheelhouse window at the sunken remains of the ice-boat and says: ‘I hope you’re right, Grand Master. I sincerely hope you’re right.’</p>

Unsure of its purpose, you hazard a guess that it is some kind of weapon that the Lavas leader intends to use against you.</p>

<p>You pilot the ship cautiously along a string of narrow fjords which cut an uncertain route through this treacherous field of icebergs. Using hand signals and telepathy, you send directions to the helmsman at the stern of the ship. It is a gruelling ordeal which takes its toll on all aboard. Every few minutes your vision is obscured by gusts of powdery snow which swirl across the prow, blown down from the tops of the surrounding ice cliffs. During these fierce blasts you often lose sight of the way ahead and are forced to rely solely upon your Kai instincts to see you through.</p>
<p>The wind howls incessantly, accompanied by the tortured screech of the hull as it skims and grazes vast banks of submerged ice. The sounds send shivers of dread coursing down your spine. The crew are also clearly terrified by the noises; they cower beside the ship’s rail and stare up at the encroaching walls of ice, mouthing prayers to Ishir, their eyes haunted with fear.</p>
<p>Then, almost without any warning, the snow-laden wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg field into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea. The crew give a hearty cheer, relieved that their icy ordeal has at last come to an end. One man pulls the cork from a bottle of black rum which he has been keeping for a special occasion. He takes a mighty swig, and then passes it to you. Just as you are raising the bottle to your lips, unexpectedly you hear one of the crew shout: ‘Ship ahoy!’</p>

<p>Several hours pass before the blizzard dies down sufficiently for you to be able to leave the cave and continue your lonely trek towards Xaagon. You reach the end of the pass where, for the first time, you get a clear view of the Deathlord’s dread city. Once, millennia ago, this city had been the home of a brilliant civilization; today the stately crystal palaces and temples of Xaagon are occupied by the lord and host of the evil dead.</p>
<p>Onward you trek, through knee-deep snow and jagged ice, towards the towering walls of Xaagon. The city is dominated by a spire of crystal which stabs the stormy sky, drawing lightning from the black clouds which swirl around its tip. From this needle-sharp point there radiates a crimson glow which sweeps the surrounding landscape. It is like a hellish lighthouse casting baleful crimson beams across a dead sea of ice.</p>
<p>Gradually, as you come within the shadows of Xaagon’s outer wall, you see two places where you could gain entry to the city beyond. The first is near to the coast, through a breach in the south wall; the second is through the city’s shattered west gate. Neither entrance appears to be guarded.</p>

<p>Your final blow draws a hellish shriek from the skull of Deathlord Ixiataaga, so loud that it batters the walls and shakes the plinth on which you stand. The Deathstaff disintegrates in his skeletal hand and he topples backwards towards the fiery moat. Yet as he does so, his body crumbles into a plume of grey-green dust which is sucked away into the whirling maw of the Shadow Gate, together with the shattering remnants of the Deathstaff.</p>
<p>Your victory over the Deathlord has freed Ixia from an evil which has enslaved its dead for millennia. Now, at last, their tormented souls can find a lasting peace. You have destroyed a great and evil entity, yet by doing so you have also unwittingly removed the power which has kept the ravages of time at bay for thousands of years. Now, time returns to Xaagon.</p>
<p>Eager to leave this place, you leap across the fiery moat and run towards the archway. But as you are passing through it, there is a terrific explosion which shakes the very foundations of the Crystal Spire. Fear grips your heart when suddenly you realize that all of Xaagon is collapsing.</p>

<p>You flee from the skeletal horde and hide in an empty outbuilding, close to the base of the watchtower, until you are sure the coast is clear. As you emerge from hiding, you hear Captain Lanza’s stirring cry ring out above the noise of battle: ‘For Lencia and the House of Sarnac!’ Despite the odds, he and his men have beaten back the enemy and are now within a stone’s throw of the quay. You rush along the street, towards the harbour, and join them at a small flagstoned square close to the quayside.</p>
<p>‘Captain—we must save the ice-boat!’ you shout, pointing to the ship which is being attacked by the skeleton horde. ‘Indeed we must,’ he replies, dourly. He draws together a handful of his men to form a protective wall around you and, the moment their shields lock together, you move with them towards the ice-boat.</p>
<p>Twenty yards from the quayside, you break away from their protective wall and sprint towards the ship’s gangplank. You are halfway along the plank when you find yourself confronted by a wedge of skeletal warriors, armed with crude axes and swords. Courageously you leap into their midst, striking them down with blurring speed and deadly accuracy. But as the last one falls, its corpse-like body almost severed at the waist, you hear a noise behind you which makes you spin around in fearful expectation.</p>

<p>You move forwards, eager to exploit your advantage, but the Deathlord reacts swiftly. He utters a guttural sound and, in the next instant, a massive bolt of energy shoots from the tip of the Deathstaff and comes speeding towards your chest.</p>

<p>Gradually you become aware that this mysterious craft is slowing down as if in preparation to dock. Anxious to escape, you leave your hiding place and climb the stairs to the deck above. Over the past few hours your shock at having witnessed the unholy resurrection of the Lencian crew has gradually turned to anger. You vow to avenge the souls of the crewmen and draw your weapon in readiness to attack the host of Drakkarim undead who are standing in rows upon the deck. But before you can act, you feel a shudder run through the steps as the host vessel comes lurching to a halt. There is a dull boom and then several portals open in the surrounding wall, spilling beams of white light across the deck of your captive ship. Scores of Drakkarim undead emerge from these portals and descend upon the ship like a host of hungry ghouls. You are forced to abandon your plan for vengeance for there are now far too many of the enemy. Yet all is not lost. In the milling confusion, you seize an opportunity to get away from the ship and escape into one of the many light-filled portals.</p>

<p>Reluctantly you turn away from the door and descend the steps to the entrance hall below. You are still determined to find and defeat the Deathlord, but in order to do so you must get to the upper levels of the Crystal Spire. Faced with no alternative, you enter the shimmering archway.</p>

<p>A sense of unease makes you slow your hurried pace as you approach the shadowy opening. The low humming noise, which has been a constant presence ever since you first entered the Crystal Spire, is almost unbearable now. Were it not for your natural Kai defences, your hearing would have suffered permanent damage the moment you passed beyond the two pillars.</p>
<p>Beyond the opening lies a grand yet sinister chamber. Peering into its gloomy recesses, you observe that this chamber was constructed with great skill and care in some distant age. But it is not the rich decorations which hold your attention; it is the whirling circular vortex which hangs on the far wall like some nightmarish, living mural. Your pulse quickens when you look into its spinning core for you recognize immediately that it is a Shadow Gate—an astral doorway to another plane of existence.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XVII]</div>
<p>Your Kai senses quickly become attuned to the powerful psychic residues which linger in this chamber. You notice that several empty coffins lie scattered about the floor and, when you focus upon them, chilling dream-like images form in your mind’s eye. You see the accursed Deathstaff emerging from the Shadow Gate. It spins end-over-end and impacts against the heavy stone lid of a coffin, breaking it in two. Its evil power feeds un-life into the mouldering remains of the Ixian Elder lying within and, driven by this ungodly energy, the remains rise up from their stony tomb. The resurrected Ixian bears the Deathstaff to the highest chamber of the Crystal Spire where, imprisoned in a cage of light fashioned by the Elder Magi, stands Deathlord Ixiataaga. The Ixian pushes the Deathstaff through the wall of this shimmering prison and, with a crackling flash, the cage of light vanishes. Freed from the magical prison which has kept him secure for thousands of years, Deathlord Ixiataaga takes the Deathstaff and howls with manic glee as he rejoices in his fateful escape.</p>
<p>The disturbing images fade from your mind, driven away by your Kai Sixth Sense which is warning you of imminent danger. A wispy black vapour is leaking from the circular stone edging which abuts the whirling Shadow Gate. You focus upon these smoky black trails and sense at once that they are alive and that they radiate an aura of evil.</p>

<p>The second wave of Lavas come swooping down <i xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>, the terrific beat of their wings forcing you and the Demonlord apart. Shielding your eyes from the stinging dust-choked wind, you look up and see that the Lavas leader is cradling the curious spiked metal bowl in its horny hands. He descends towards Tagazin and inverts it, and suddenly you realize its true purpose and design. It is a helm of power, affixed on top with a crystal spike. The Lavas places the helm upon the Demonlord’s head and the spike begins to glow menacingly.</p>
<p>Now all of the Lavas ascend into the sky where they wait to view a confrontation which is about to commence. Suddenly Tagazin, revitalized by the power of the spiked helm, comes charging at you with his head lowered, snorting gruffly like a maddened bull.</p>

<p>You quickly recover and take your position at the helm, yet the impact has left you shivering with shock. The crew have also been clearly terrified by the collision; most of them are cowering along the ship’s rail, staring up at the encroaching walls of ice, their eyes haunted with fear as they pray silently to the Goddess Ishir.</p>
<p>Then, almost without any warning, the snow-laden wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg field into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea. The crew give a hearty cheer, relieved that their icy ordeal has at last come to an end. One man pulls the cork from a bottle of black rum which he has been keeping for a special occasion. He takes a mighty swig, and then passes it to a comrade. Just as the second man is raising the bottle to his lips, unexpectedly you hear the pilot’s voice echoing along the deck: ‘Ship ahoy!’</p>

<p>The freezing winds of the abyss tear mercilessly at your body as you tumble headlong through this cold and lightless void. You scream with anguish but hear nothing, not even the sound of your own voice, for sound does not exist in the airless limbo of a Shadow Gate. You are in no-space, falling helplessly between two planes of existence.</p>
<p>You are on the brink of unconsciousness when, with shocking abruptness, you splash face-first into a warm and stinking mire. Coughing and retching, you stagger to your feet and claw the oily muck from your stinging eyes. When you prise open your gluey eyelids, the sight which greets your disbelieving gaze is wholly unlike that of frigid Ixia. You find yourself knee-deep in steaming mud, surrounded by a hot and humid jungle of dense vegetation. Your Kai senses detect an all-consuming aura of evil which saturates this swampy land, warning you that this foul, stinking mire is part of the Plane of Darkness—the domain of the Dark God Naar. You scan the fetid landscape and sense that you are not alone—Tagazin is here, beyond the range of your vision but, nevertheless, not too far distant.<sup><a href="#sect303-1-foot" name="sect303-1">17</a></sup></p>
<p>A sense of helplessness assails your spirit, feeding a growing fear that you have failed your mission. Your only hope is to find another Shadow Gate through which you can escape from this nightmare plane and return to your home world. Weary and despondent, you trudge through the slime towards a ridge of firm ground which is carpeted with lime-green moss. You sense Tagazin’s presence somewhere in this direction and you cling to the faint hope that he may be able to lead you to the Shadow Gate you seek.</p>

<h3><a name="sect304">304</a></h3>

<p>From your hiding place among the boulders you watch the activities of the loathsome undead. The causeway and jetty are teeming with cadaverous soldiers who, under the direction of several spindly, black-clad creatures, are busily transferring materials to and from the ice-boats and the open mouth of the submarine. The tunnel entrance lies only two hundred yards away, yet reaching it without being detected by the enemy looks to be a near-impossible task. You are trying to formulate a plan of action when suddenly you notice a means by which you can achieve your goal.</p>
<p>The track, which branches away from the causeway and leads to the tunnel entrance, passes close beside your hiding place. Every so often a wagon loaded with equipment trundles along this track towards the jetty, and an empty one trundles back. When the next empty wagon appears, you get ready to abandon your hiding place and leap aboard its open tailgate.</p>
<p>Patiently you observe your chosen wagon. It is being hauled by a shaggy, grey-furred beast of burden which is harnessed by heavy leather straps. As it trundles past the boulders you break cover, leap aboard the tail, and hide yourself from sight beneath a greasy, foul-smelling tarpaulin. Through a crack in its ancient wooden planks you watch with trepidation as the wagon moves slowly towards the tunnel entrance. It enters the tunnel, unchallenged by the skeletal warriors who stand guard here, and ascends a gentle gradient to another ice-walled cavern. Several passages connect at this point from all directions, like the spokes of a giant wheel converging at the hub.</p>

<p>Groaning from the pain of your wound, you stagger to your feet and barge your way through the skeletal warriors who are now clustered in the doorway to the cell. The speed of your action, so soon after receiving a wound that would have killed outright any lesser mortal, takes the group by surprise and leaves them sprawled helplessly on the ground. By the time they have untangled themselves and found their feet, you are nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>When you are sure that you are not being followed, you pause for a few moments to attend to your wounded stomach. Once you have staunched the bleeding, you then use your Magnakai skill of Nexus in an attempt to determine the location of your missing weapons and equipment. You sense they are not too distant and, guided by your intuition, you go off along an adjoining passageway in search of them.</p>
<p>The dingy, ice-caked tunnel wends its way deeper into the bowels of this vast alien vessel. You explore a series of empty holds, where the walls are braced with gleaming crystal girders, and pass through low-ceilinged chambers that, despite the biting chill, reek of death and decay. At length your search ends at a great grey door which is guarded by two undead Drakkarim warriors, armed with spears. The noises you heard earlier have now ceased, and so has the movement of the vessel; you sense that this craft is no longer at sea.</p>

<p>The portal opens out into a domed chamber where several great orbs of fire-filled crystal, mounted on mechanical plinths, generate the intense light which is flooding the deck of the captive ship. You cross to a tunnel which leads out of the chamber and follow along a series of dingy, ice-caked corridors that wend their way deeper into the bowels of this vast alien vessel. You explore a maze of empty holds where the walls are braced with gleaming crystal girders, and pass through countless low-ceilinged chambers that, despite the biting chill, reek of death and decay. At length you come to a junction where the corridor splits in two directions.</p>

<p>As the <cite>Maycastle</cite> cuts through the icy waves towards the fort, a beacon flares into life, its guttering yellow flame marking the entrance to the outpost’s slate-walled harbour. A Lencian flag is raised atop the watchtower and the crew give a cheer—for them it is a welcoming sight after two cold and difficult weeks at sea.</p>
<p>The <cite>Maycastle</cite> docks at the harbour wall, alongside the iron-bowed ice-boat which will take you to Ixia. The excited garrison have gathered to greet the crew; they have been looking forward to receiving fresh provisions and news from their homeland for several weeks. You disembark with Prarg and are met on the quay by a bearded sergeant clad in a fur-trimmed leather tunic. He escorts you to the watchtower, where you are welcomed in person by Captain Lanza, the garrison commander.</p>

Cursing your luck, you turn and run towards the stern section, where you hide behind the ship’s rudder gear. The undead warriors ignore the broken bodies of those you fought, and make only a cursory search. As you watch them climbing out of the hold you breathe a silent sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Finally the lock surrenders to your blows and the heavy portal creaks ajar. Immediately you are greeted by a blast of frozen air as you push open the door and step out onto a viewing platform which is fixed to the outer metallic skin of this huge alien submarine. Away to your right you can see a line of ice-boats at anchor at the lake’s edge, and to your left you notice a column of skeletal warriors. These are being led by a black-robed Cabalah, marching in mechanical fashion along the jetty towards the mouth of a tunnel which leads out of the vast ice cavern. Your keen Kai senses tell you that you have arrived in Ixia, and that the distant tunnel leads to the surface.</p>
<p>You commit the position of the ice-boats to memory; if your mission is successful, you will be needing some means by which you can escape from Ixia. Then you carefully observe the area immediately surrounding the submarine, and notice that there are only two ways by which you can reach the distant tunnel—by the adjacent jetty, or by entering the icy waters of the lake and swimming to the shore.</p>

<p>From the prow of the enemy ship comes a hissing cloud of fire-tipped arrows. You dive for cover and escape being hit, but many of the burning shafts pierce the ice-boat’s decking and start fires in the sails. The flames spread with unnatural speed and you are quickly engulfed by flames.</p>

Lanza has ordered them to land you on the coast of Ixia and wait at anchor for seven days for you to return; they must wait no longer.</p>

Once, millennia ago, this city had been the home of a brilliant civilization; today the stately crystal palaces and temples of Xaagon are occupied by the evil dead.</p>
<p>Onward you trek, through knee-deep snow and jagged ice, towards the towering walls of Xaagon. The city is dominated by a spire of crystal which stabs the stormy sky, drawing lightning from the black clouds which swirl around its tip. From this needle-sharp point there radiates a crimson glow which sweeps the surrounding landscape. It is like a hellish lighthouse, casting its baleful crimson beams across a landscape that has frozen to death.</p>
<p>Gradually, as you come within the shadows of Xaagon’s outer wall, you see two places where you could gain entry to the city beyond. The first is through a breach in the south wall, near to the coast; the second is through the city’s shattered west gate. Neither entrance appears to be guarded.</p>

<p>Freshly equipped and fired by the taste of victory, Lanza and his men set about hammering the remnants of the attacking enemy. They drive them all the way back to their ship, literally shattering all who dare stand in their way. Within the hour the outpost is secured—the enemy have been destroyed.</p>
<p>You survey the aftermath of the battle with mixed emotions. You feel elated at having helped Lanza to win, but the ice-boat, which was to have conveyed you to Ixia, is now a burned wreck lying at the bottom of the harbour. All that can be seen of it is a few feet of its mainmast protruding at an angle above the surface of the sea. As you stare at this blackened masthead, you are joined by Captain Prarg.</p>

You have just passed a derelict mausoleum when you are forced to halt and hide from a passing troop of Ixian warriors. You watch as they march swiftly along an ice-choked avenue towards a plaza that is dominated by a huge frozen fountain.

It hits the surface of the sea, close to the harbour wall, and instantly the patch of briny water freezes over.</p>

Seconds after hauling yourself out of the water, the massive body of this creature surges past, barely a few feet from where you are clinging limpet-like to the jetty wall. The sight of this huge monster electrifies you, sending you scurrying to the top of the jetty as quickly as your aching limbs will allow. From a makeshift hiding place among some wooden crates, you look down at the swirling water and watch as the Gybia circles the jetty in a wide arc. On its second sweep, it veers away and returns disappointedly to its underwater pen.</p>
<p>The jetty is teeming with undead soldiers who, under the direction of the same black-clad creature who released the Gybia, are busily transferring materials to and from the open mouth of the submarine.

<p>Warmly they congratulate you, praising your inspired act of courage and bravery but you sense that all is not well. The feeling of unease which haunted you upon leaving the ice-caverns of Ixia has returned.</p>
<p>‘Where’s Banedon?’ you ask of Lord Ardan. ‘Is something wrong?’</p>
<p>Ardan’s face grows as sombre as his reply. ‘King Ulnar sent word to Sarnac’s court, summoning the Guildmaster to return urgently to Sommerlund. It is grave news, I’m afraid, Grand Master. In your absence, your country has been attacked. The Dark God, Naar, has sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to destroy the Second Order of the Kai and lay waste to your homeland. It is said his new minions are confident of swift victory for they are sure you will never defeat the Deathlord of Ixia.’</p>
<p>‘I must leave for Sommerlund at once,’ you say, looking to the eastern horizon. ‘My brethren and my country need me.’</p>
<p>The others nod in silent agreement. ‘We will do all we can,’ replies Lord Ardan, ‘to speed your passage home.’</p>
<p>The news of your country’s plight comes as a terrible shock. In Ixia, you have won a great and lasting victory against the forces of Evil, but could the cost be too great? You fear, also, for the lives of your young Kai acolytes. The Second Order are worthy Kai warriors but they are young, their mettle yet to be tested in the furnace-heat of battle. You pray to Kai himself that they be strong enough to resist Naar’s newest champions, at least until you return.</p>

<h2><a name="map">Ixia &amp; the Hardlands</a></h2>


<p>The frozen peninsula of Ixia juts westwards, barely linked to the mainland of Northern Magnamund. Its northern coastline is perpetually locked by pack ice, as is a small, unnamed island just off the north coast, approximately 100 miles northwest of the city of Xaagon. Only the westernmost tip of Ixia’s northern coastline is open to the freezing sea of Aztaregina. To the west of this point is the long, thin Gourstaz Island, almost 100 miles due west of Xaagon.</p>
<p>The city of Xaagon lies at the centre of the peninsula, close to the southern coastline and is surrounded by mountains. South of the Ixian peninsula is the Shakoz Bight, a tempestuous gulf of the Tozaz Sea devoid of islands, where the waves crash against the beaches of Tadatizaga—The Hardlands. The coastline sweeps in a jagged arc here before leading west for some leagues and eventually turning south and then southeast as the Gulf of Konkor eats away at the hilly wastelands. At the northern point between the gulf and the Tozaz Sea lies Azgad Island, about 250 miles southwest of Xaagon. Several lonely rivers flow into this gulf—the Ezog, the Zegar, and the Lenag—none of which flow past any Drakkarim settlements.</p>
<p>Several hundred miles inland to the east of the Gulf of Konkor, the hilly terrain gives way to the coniferous Konatadat Forest. Beyond this lies the deep, cold waters of Lake Ghargon, devoid of even the smallest islet. Hundreds of miles north of Lake Ghargon is the tundra of Gourizaga, the most northwesterly area of the Darklands, just to the east of the Ixian peninsula. The Shegtar Peaks lie here, alone in the freezing north, where no one dwells.</p>

<h2><a name="crsumary">Combat Rules Summary</a></h2>


<ol>
<li>Add your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to any extra points given to you by your Grand Master Disciplines.</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. This number = Combat Ratio.</li>
<li>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio on the top of the chart and cross-reference to the random number you have picked. (E indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Enemy. LW indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Lone Wolf.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from Stage 3 until one character is dead. This is when the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either character falls to 0 or below.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="smevazn">To Evade Combat</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>You may only do this when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>You undertake one round of combat in the usual way. All points lost by the enemy are ignored; only Lone Wolf loses the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>If the book offers the chance of taking evasive action in place of combat, it can be taken in the first round of combat or any subsequent round.</li>
