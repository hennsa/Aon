 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>You are the warrior Lone Wolf—Kai Grand Master of Sommerlund. Fresh from your victory over your evil alter-ego, Wolf’s Bane, reluctantly you are forced to return to the Plane of Darkness. For there you glimpsed the fabled Moonstone and you have sworn to save this gem of mystical power from the clutches of Naar, the King of Ultimate Darkness.</p>

   <p>In <strong><cite>The Curse of Naar</cite></strong>, you must venture once more through the Shadow Gate and confront the Dark God. Only by finding and retrieving the Moonstone can you hope to save your world from invasion by Naar’s armies of night. In this ultimate Grand Master challenge, your life and the future of your entire world are at stake!</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, the sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of the Kai—the warrior élite of Sommerlund. It is the year MS 5081, thirty-one years since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain—the Darklands—and destroyed the base of their power that was the infernal city of Helgedad. In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies that had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against the odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding enemy armies.</p>
<p>For more than ten years now, peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a New Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors has been reestablished. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess strong latent Kai skills and all show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>
<p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai (which were once thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to) was truly a revelation. This discovery has inspired you to search for the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to scale the very pinnacle of Kai perfection—to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>
<p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and the training of the New Order recruits. Your efforts were swiftly rewarded for within the space of two short years the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>
<p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the Lorestones of Nyxator—seven gems of Kai power which you had recovered during an earlier quest for Kai knowledge. In this vault, bathed in the golden light of the radiant gems, you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors—Banedon and Rimoah—you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines and grasp the fundamental secrets of Brotherhood and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened far beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
<p>In the years since your victory over the Darklords, peace has reigned victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms have rejoiced in the knowledge that the evil which once threatened to destroy them has been banished from the face of Magnamund. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still some who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of the Dark God Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>
<p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar’s agents and you have, on each occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. Yet your continuing victories have enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. From the depths of his stronghold upon the Plane of Darkness he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called ‘Wolf’s Bane’ who was the very image of yourself. While you were engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland and sought to destroy your reputation and the honour of the Kai. And he would have succeeded had it not been for your courage and determination. You returned home and pursued your enemy to an ancient necropolis in the city of Tyso. Here, in a deep subterranean crypt, you and your evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate, an astral corridor which connects your home world of Magnamund to several other planes of existence. You both emerged upon the remote planet of Avaros where a deadly duel ensued. With the unexpected help of an enigmatic elemental called Alyss you vanquished your foe, but before you could find your way back to your home world, you and Alyss were both sucked through a second Shadow Gate which led to the Plane of Darkness, the fell domain of Naar himself.</p>
<p>In the throne hall of Naar a titanic struggle took place as you and Alyss fought desperately to escape from the Dark God and his court of powerful minions. During this battle you discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti, a wondrous artefact created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti whose presence upon Magnamund had heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund is measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone’s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the Isle of Lorn in remotest Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of your eyes told you that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of the Dark God.</p>
<p>Suddenly the significance of the Moonstone became crystal clear. Naar had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world, while the goodly forces of Kai and Ishir had been held at bay, helpless to counter them. Only you and your Kai brethren have stood in the way of the onslaught of Naar’s agents since the demise of the Darklords.</p>
<p>During the battle, thanks to Alyss’s selfless courage, you were able to escape from Naar’s throne hall by leaping into the Shadow Gate. As you entered its whirling maw, the last image that burned itself into your memory was that of Alyss slowly succumbing to the relentless attacks of Naar’s minions. Successfully you had defeated Wolf’s Bane and thwarted Naar’s sinister plan to destroy the honour of the Kai, but as you returned through the Shadow Gate to the land of your birth, you knew that the fight against Evil was not yet won. You realized that if you are to prevent the Dark God from sending more of his dread creations into Magnamund, you would have to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from the ravages of Naar’s armies of darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>For more than ten years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>—and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you begin this ultimate Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 31). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1–19), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to Book 20. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1–5) or <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6–12) adventures.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1–5) and <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6–12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13–onwards):</p>
<ul>

<li>Sommerswerd<sup><a href="#gamerulz-3-foot" name="gamerulz-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Silver Helm</li>
<li>Dagger of Vashna</li>
<li>Silver Bracers</li>
<li>Jewelled Mace</li>

</dl>
<p>Now, through the pursuit of new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the Gods Kai and Ishir go with you on your brave and noble quest.</p>
<p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your quest, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat with one of your Grand Weaponmastery weapons, you add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Defender, with which you begin the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, means you are supremely efficient in the use of <em>two</em> of the weapons listed below. For each book that you complete in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13–20), you will gain mastery of an additional weapon. For example, if you complete <cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite> and have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery at the beginning of the next <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> book, you may choose an additional Weapon to gain mastery of.</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Short Sword</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>Quarterstaff</li>
<li>Broadsword</li>
<li>Axe</li>
<li>Sword</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 to any number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.<sup><a href="#discplnz-1-foot" name="discplnz-1">4</a></sup></p>
<h4><a name="anmlmstr">Animal Mastery</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.</p>
<h4><a name="deliver">Deliverance (Advanced Curing)</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, whilst in combat, their <small>ENDURANCE</small> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. This ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
<h4><a name="assimila">Assimilance (Advanced Invisibility)</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of a few days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques that make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.</p>
<h4><a name="hntmstry">Grand Huntmastery</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and have greatly heightened senses of touch and taste. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p>
<h4><a name="pthmnshp">Grand Pathsmanship</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by hostile plants and have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.</p>
<h4><a name="kaisurge">Kai-surge</a></h4>

<p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. (Kai-surge, Psi-surge, and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.)</p>
<p>Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>
<h4><a name="kaiscrn">Kai-screen</a></h4>

<p>In psychic combat, Grand Masters are able to construct mind fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increase as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h4><a name="nexus">Grand Nexus</a></h4>

<p>Grand Masters are able to withstand contact with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h4><a name="gnosis">Telegnosis (Advanced Divination)</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Grand Master to spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far fewer ill-effects. Duration and the protection of his inanimate body increase as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h4><a name="magi">Magi-magic</a></h4>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lord Rimoah, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of battle-magic, as taught to the Vakeros—the native warriors of Dessi. These skills include the basic use of basic Old Kingdom Spells such as <i>Shield</i>, <i>Power Word</i>, and <i>Invisible Fist</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.</p>
<h4><a name="alchemy">Kai-alchemy</a></h4>

<p>Under the tutelage of Guildmaster Banedon, you have mastered the elementary spells of Left-handed magic, as practised by the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells include <i>Lightning Hand</i>, <i>Levitation</i>, and <i>Mind Charm</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Left-handed magic increase, enabling you eventually to craft new Kai weapons and artefacts.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you begin your perilous quest for the Moonstone, you take with you a <a href="#map">map of the Planes of Existence</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1–19), you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. Fifty Crowns is the maximum you can carry, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your monastery.</p>
<p>You can take four items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess from previous adventures (remember, you are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry a maximum of ten Backpack Items).</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterstaff (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Broadsword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bow (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows; record them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>2 Meals (Meals) Each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Rope (Backpack Item)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Item) This potion restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for only one dose.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Axe (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>List the four items that you choose on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the appropriate headings, and make a note of any effect they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is recommended that you also equip yourself with a close combat weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Gold Dagger; Magic Pendant), or is clearly labelled as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, if you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 32) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> giving him a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 40.<br /><br />
He subtracts the Doomwolf pack’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +10 (40−30 = +10). +10 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +10. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat)</li>
<li>Doomwolf Pack loses 9 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership. As you complete successfully each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, you will gain an additional Grand Master Discipline and progress towards the pinnacle of Kai perfection—to become a Kai Supreme Master.</p>

<h4><a name="guardian">Kai Grand Guardian</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian (5 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>

</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this skill are able to create a cloud of fog-like vapour within 15 yards of their location. This fog will obscure both normal and infravision. The duration of the fog increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians with this skill enjoy increased mobility when travelling across all types of terrain, whether on foot or on horseback. This improved ability is very useful when used to outdistance a pursuing enemy.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to attack up to three enemies in psychic combat simultaneously.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>

</ul><br /><br />
</dd>

</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature’s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Knights with this skill are able to repel at will all normal-sized insects within a radius of three yards. The range and number of insects so affected increase considerably as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Halt Missile</i>—This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may  pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2–3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight sufficient time to move away from its line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by  this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Strength</i>—By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunlord">Sun Lord</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Lord (7 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast—a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a ‘0’ = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration and degree of surface difficulty increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Lord are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Penetrate</i>—This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
<li><i>Energy Grasp</i>—This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i>, but differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or an enemy to effect the spell.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunthane">Sun Thane</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Thane (8 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes with this Discipline are able to command an animal to fall asleep at will. Some hostile animals may be able to resist this command, but most will be affected by it in some way. The duration of effect and the number of animals which can be affected at one time will increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this skill are able to conduct a Kai Exorcism. This ritual will banish any evil supernatural force that has taken possession of any goodly creature or object.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>

The volume of water affected, and  the duration of effect, both increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to erect a special psychic defence called <i>Mindfort</i>. A <i>Mindfort</i> defence greatly reduces the effects of any psychic shock that would normally paralyse or weaken a lesser mortal.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Thane are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Slow Fall</i>—By casting this spell, Kai Sun Thanes are able to slow their rate of free-falling to three feet per second, thereby avoiding damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. The duration of the spell is limited at first, but it steadily increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Breathe Water</i>—Using this spell, a Kai Sun Thane is able to breathe underwater for ten minutes. The duration of effect increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="grandthane">Grand Thane</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Kai Grand Master who has reached the rank of Grand Thane (9 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes with this Discipline are able to call upon the God Kai for divine assistance should a situation warrant it. Kai cannot intervene to save a Grand Thane from physical danger, but he can give signs which may help a Grand Thane choose the best course of action. A Grand Thane can call upon the God Kai for assistance no more than once every month. The frequency of divine audiences will increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes who possess this skill are able to protect themselves from detection by creatures using infravision (the ability to see the heat radiating from a person or thing), or ultravision (the ability to detect objects or movement in the ultraviolet spectrum of light).<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes with this skill are able to focus their mind-power upon inanimate breakable objects, e.g. bottles, windows, all ceramics, urns, jugs, etc., and cause them to explode violently. Any person or creature in close proximity to such an explosion risks injury from flying shrapnel.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes who possess mastery of this Discipline can pass freely through Shadow Gates. These phenomena are special portals which enable one to access other dimensions and planes of existence outside of Magnamund. Kai Grand Thanes are able to detect the location of Shadow Gates and pass through them without suffering any physical ill effects. The range of detection increases as a Kai Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to detect the exact location of precious gems, and valuable metals such as gold, platinum, and silver. These minerals and metals may occur naturally in the ground or they could be part of a hidden treasure hoard. The range of this ability is limited at first, but increases steadily as a Kai Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Grand Thane are able to use the following Old Kingdom Battle-spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Power Glyph</i>—By inscribing this ancient glyph (a secret magical symbol) upon a door, an archway, or even upon the lid of a closed box, a Kai Grand Thane is able to protect items or portals from being opened. Any creature attempting to open a portal protected in such a way will release the power of the glyph and suffer its deadly effects.</li>
<li><i>Hold Enemy</i>—Using this spell, Kai Grand Thanes are able to immobilize a single hostile creature anywhere within twenty feet of themselves. The duration of the spell is dependent upon the size and strength of the targeted creature. The range and duration of effect of this spell increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="grandcrown">Grand Crown</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Grand Crown, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Crowns with this discipline are consummate masters of unarmed combat. When fighting bare-handed, i.e. without any weapons, they may add 3 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Grand Crowns with this ability are able to plant in the mind of any animal the image of their most feared predator or adversary. Under the influence of this illusion the animal will believe, with all of its senses, that it is being confronted by such a creature instead of a Kai Grand Crown.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Grand Crowns with this skill are able to create a clear passageway through dense undergrowth, forest, or jungle. Once having passed through this passageway, the plant material will revert to its normal state. This skill can also be employed by a Kai Grand Crown against magical foliage, or to counter any plant material ranged against him by an enemy.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Grand Crowns who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to mask the goodly aura which radiates naturally from their minds and bodies. Additionally, Grand Crowns can deliberately alter these auras to give a false impression of themselves to creatures that are sensitive to such psychic auras.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>Grand Crowns who possess this Discipline are able to speak a Kai Power Word—a holy utterance which will cause physical and psychic damage to any single creature within a radius of thirty feet. The degree of damage so caused and the resultant drain upon a Grand Crown’s reserves of <small>ENDURANCE</small> are dependent upon individual circumstances. The power and range of this skill increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Grand Crown are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Teleport</i>—By casting this spell, Kai Grand Crowns can transport themselves physically to any place which they can see with their own eyes. The spell will carry the caster, his equipment, and clothing to his chosen sighted destination. It cannot be used on any other living creature and it will not transport any other living creature along with the caster. Use of this spell will cost the caster between 1 and 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points every time it is used. This cost reduces as a Kai Grand Master increases in rank.</li>
<li><i>See Illusion</i>—Using this spell, a Kai Grand Crown is able to detect an illusion and know immediately its true identity or purpose.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunprince">Sun Prince</a></h4>

<p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Prince (11 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Princes with this Discipline are able to alter their appearance, including clothing and equipment, to take on the guise of any animal that they may come into contact with. This physical change will only be witnessed by the animal in question.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Princes with this ability are able to cause the regeneration of lost body parts, i.e. hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes, and internal organs. This improved Discipline can be used to repair a Sun Prince’s own body, or that of another person or creature. The time required to effect regeneration depends on the size and relative importance of the body part affected.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Princes who possess this Discipline are able to create an illusory double of themselves and project this image up to a range of thirty feet. The Sun Prince must remain in visual contact with his/her image in order to maintain the illusion. Physical, magical, and psychic attacks upon the illusory image will cause no injury. The range of this ability increases substantially when a Sun Prince attains the rank of Kai Supreme Master.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Sun Princes who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to focus their psychic power into a Kai-ray: a laser-like beam of mental energy capable of penetrating the strongest of psychic defences. This ability can be used once during a combat to reduce an enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> score by 15 points. However, use of this Kai-ray will also reduce a Sun Prince’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> score by 4 points. It cannot be used if a Sun Prince’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> score is 10 or less, and it cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Sun Princes who possess this Discipline are able to create a mental sanctuary in which to keep safe their minds from psychic assault. Creation of this sanctuary does not require thought or concentration; it occurs instantly whenever a Kai Sun Prince is subjected to psychic attack. The defensive strength of this sanctuary further increases when a Sun Prince attains the rank of Kai Supreme Master.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Prince are able to control their direction and rate of movement when subjected to strong currents of air or water, or when venturing through non-material planes of existence, e.g. Shadow Gates.<br /><br />

<p>Your journey through the Shadow Gate is a cold and lonely voyage, yet one that you endure without fear for you sense that Alyss is watching over you. She is using her powers to steer you safely home to Magnamund. As you hurtle through the timeless void, you remember vividly the last few moments which preceded your leap into the Shadow Gate and your triumphant escape from Naar’s throne hall, the innermost sanctum of his stronghold upon the Plane of Darkness. You recall how Alyss commanded you to flee whilst she drew away the frenzied attacks of Naar’s champion, Kekataag the Avenger. It was her selfless act of bravery which enabled you to escape and it has left an indelible mark upon your conscience. Inspired by her courage—and by the realization that if the Dark God is to be stopped from sending more of his foul creations to Magnamund you must deny him the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti—you vow that you will return to the Plane of Darkness and recapture that precious stone of power.</p>
<p>After what seems like an eternity, gradually the inky blackness of the abyss is illuminated by a fluorescent vapour studded with whirling motes of light. Clumps of tiny stars swirl around your body like swarms of glowing moths until you become completely cocooned within a shroud of blinding white luminescence. Then, quite suddenly, you feel solid ground once more beneath your feet and you emerge from the light to find yourself standing in a dank, subterranean vault.</p>

<p>As the first bolts come whistling through the air, you throw yourself behind Shamath’s great Throne of Power. Crouching here, as you listen fearfully to the hiss of flying missiles and the screams of the approaching horde, you notice the waters of the strange pool which lies no more than a dozen yards from the throne. Beyond this pool you see the pair of huge black gates which dominate the far wall of this chamber and suddenly you recall the text which appeared in the Tome of Darkness. This must be the Pool of Sorrows, and beyond it are the Gates of Darkness, an exit from this cruel domain. Your feelings of excitement at having discovered a way to escape the approaching horde are tempered when you further recall that you must spill your own blood into the pool if you are to leave this realm successfully. Without hesitation, you stab a finger against the point of your belt buckle and draw a few droplets of blood. Then you spring to your feet and rush towards the pool. As you come to within a few yards, you flick your finger and a stunning transformation takes place the instant your blood hits the pool’s swirling surface.</p>

<p>The swirling mist condenses and reshapes itself into a column of flickering light. It resembles a large candle flame, but one that radiates an icy coldness.

<p>You have survived the first volley but your ordeal is far from over. As soon as the front rank hurl their spears they retreat to let those behind them come forward to take their places at the rim of the pit. With cool defiance you stare back at this new rank of mutants. This time you count more than thirty spears held ready to be hurled at you upon Nza’pok’s command, far more than you can hope to avoid at once, even with the aid of magic. Yet, despite the overwhelming odds, you refuse to show this loathsome spawn any sign of weakness or despair.</p>
<p>You offer up a silent prayer to the God Kai to protect you, and then suddenly you recall part of the script of the Tome of Darkness that told of a secret name which can bind Nza’pok when spoken aloud. This name could be the key to your survival, yet you have no time left to retrieve the book from your Backpack. If you are to use this secret name you must try to recall it from memory.</p>

<p>As the beast struggles to break free from its sticky prison, you turn your attention to the portal and examine its surface in an attempt to find a way to open it. Using your advanced Kai skills you are able to decipher enough of the runic text to discover the secret code which keeps it secure.

<p>You stride towards Nza’pok and raise your weapon, grimly determined to rid the universe of this foul creature.</p>
<p>‘So perish all spawn of evil,’ you cry, and, with one swift and mighty blow, you sunder his ghastly body in two. From the torn halves of his carcass there is an eruption of putrid gas that makes you reel backwards and cover your mouth and nose. Rapidly this gas dissipates and, in a matter of seconds, the remains of Nza’pok and his amulet have turned to dust.</p>
<p>A collective cry of horror arises from the distant horde the moment you slay their master. Fearing that the destruction of their leader will spur them to seek revenge, you hurry away along a track that winds through the settlement of huts and down to a beach covered with coarse black sand. Here a ramshackle jetty, constructed from wood and bone, protrudes from the lee of a sand dune and out into the sluggish grey sea. Fringing the beach is dense jungle from where there suddenly arises a cacophony of hellish cries, echoing those of the chaos-horde. You glimpse shadows moving in the undergrowth, and when you stop momentarily to take a longer look, several arrows come shooting out of the trees. They arc towards you and explode when they hit the sand close by. Your Kai senses warn you that there are a great number of archers lurking in the jungle, far more than you can hope to defeat single-handedly. Anxious to escape while you are still able, you hurry down the beach to the jetty where you discover a sea-going canoe. Without daring to look back, you leap into this canoe, cast off its mooring rope, and paddle as fast as you can away from the shore.</p>
<p>Once you feel sure that you are beyond arrow range, you attempt to follow the coastline in the hope of finding a safer place to put ashore. But a mist sweeps in across the water and engulfs your tiny craft before you can change course. This mist thickens rapidly to become a dense sea fog, the like of which you have never experienced. Despite your advanced Kai skills, you are unable to see through it and you quickly lose all sense of time and direction.</p>
<p>After what seems like many hours, you eventually catch sight of a dark shape low in the water which, at first, appears to be a distant island. You paddle towards it but as you draw closer your senses suddenly scream a warning that you are heading into deadly danger. Instantly you reverse your stroke to change course, but it is already too late. Two slits open in the dark shape and a ghostly light washes over the fog-wreathed ocean. You feel the canoe lurch violently as it is hit by a powerful undercurrent and, in the next terrifying instant, you are sucked into the maw of a titanic sea creature and swallowed whole.</p>

Upon reaching this busy area it hovers above an expanse of levelled ground which is covered with dozens of cargo nets full of blocks awaiting collection by the building teams. A crew of four reptilians guide your net gently to the ground and then swiftly they unhook it from the dragon’s harness using long poles.</p>
<p>From the safety of your hiding place you watch as the dragon flies away to collect another cargo. As soon as the reptilians move on to attend to the next delivery of blocks, you leave the net and make your way as quickly as you can towards the main temple.</p>

You wipe your weapon against the trunk of a tree to remove the worst of the foul-smelling ichor, and then you move back along the trail towards the beach. However, when you reach the edge of the trees you see a patrol of scaly-winged reptiles swooping and gliding along the rocky shoreline.

This expanse of level ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you make your way around the fruits and across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching amongst the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with a pair of sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door.

You draw and raise your weapon and, in the space of a heartbeat, you deal the worm a mighty blow which splits it open from mouth to tail. Cadak’s spirit emits a hideous scream, as if the destruction of the worm has wounded him deeply.

<p>The unexpected sight of your face in the pool fills Shamath with a blind rage. In her fury, she expels a mass of psychic energy from which, using your Magnakai Discipline of Divination, you are able to extract scores of vivid images. They are Shamath’s memories of what befell her after she failed to resurrect Darklord Vashna from the depths of the Maakengorge.</p>
<p>From the collage of images you deduce that your destruction of the Shadow Gate at Maakengorge forced Shamath to return to the Plane of Darkness. As punishment for her failure to complete her mission, Naar imprisoned her and commanded Shamath’s hated rival—Avarvae the Tormentress—to ruin her evil beauty. Satisfied that the Demoness had paid for her failure, Naar allowed her to return to her realm where, ever since, she has been goaded and tormented by her malicious rival.</p>

On your travels through this vast underworld you witness many awe-inspiring sights: huge subterranean quarries, blazing furnaces, armouries, weapon forges, steel mills, and white-hot lava pits. Armies of grey-skinned humanoid workers labour without rest within this hellish domain to manufacture weapons of war and destruction.</p>
<p>At one vast hall you stop to observe a legion of these creatures tapping the volcanic power which lies at the core of this realm. By a system of chutes and tubes they divert a blazing lava flow to turn gigantic wheels and heat titanic vats of noxious fluids. The workers, although physically similar in size and demeanour to Drakkarim, seem to lack consciousness and remain oblivious to your presence. It is as if they have been turned into unthinking automatons, programmed simply to perform their labour with little regard to their immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>You leave the hall and ascend a staircase which spirals hundreds of feet through solid rock to a titanic concourse. Here your senses detect a living presence and you allow your Kai instincts to lead you in pursuit of it. You enter a tunnel which branches away from the concourse and follow this to a wider passage. The walls of this passage are decorated with spectacular scenes of war and destruction. Thousands of troops fight an endless parade of battles across the landscapes of a hundred different worlds. In each of the scenes the theme and the outcome is identical: the victory of the superior forces of Evil over the inferior armies of Good. This callous celebration of evil military might infuriates you, but you control your anger and use it to sharpen your senses. You detect that somewhere at the end of this passage is where the living presence can be found and, not knowing the nature of what it is that you will find there, you approach with the utmost caution.</p>
<p>The passage ends at a vast chasm where a narrow bridge of rock crosses a yawning void to a gate located on the far side, some 300 yards distant. The gate and its surroundings have been fashioned to resemble the mouth and head of a ferocious dragon, and the bridge of rock is likewise carved to resemble its extended tongue. A shimmering, twinkling, blue-white light gleams from the mouth of the dragon-gate, revealing it to be the exit from this dark domain. Excited by your discovery, you step onto the narrow rock-bridge and make your way across to the far side as swiftly as you dare. On either side of this stone beam the chasm falls away into a seemingly bottomless pit. You try not to look down for the sight makes your stomach churn uncontrollably.</p>
<p>You are nearing the centre of the bridge when suddenly a dark and terrifying apparition manifests itself before the dragon-gate. This awesome sight brings you skidding to a halt.</p>

From somewhere above the canopy of branches there comes a deafening noise, like the sound of heavy tropical rainfall. As if in response to this noise the hanging vines rise up and flail the air.

<p>Your speed and skill have devastated the maggot swarm. You have slain more than half their number and forced the remainder to seek shelter in the shadowy recesses of this reeking hall. You sense also that your victory over the swarm has greatly weakened the spirit of Cadak. You are about to seize the advantage and launch a psychic attack when suddenly you hear something quite unexpected.</p>
<p>‘Spare me and forgive me, Lone Wolf,’ pleads Cadak’s plaintive voice in your mind. ‘I renounce my evil past. Forgive me so that death may free my soul from the slavery of Evil. Grant me this salvation and I shall help you to escape from the realm of the Künae.’</p>
<p>The receding tide of maggots has revealed a glowing ring that lies on the slime-smeared floor at the centre of the hall.</p>
<p>‘Take the ring, Lone Wolf. Take the ring and grant me your forgiveness. With the ring the way is clear for you to leave this hall through the Tunnel of the Wyrm.’</p>
<p>Beyond the flame-like spirit of Cadak you can see the rotting rib cage of the reptilian carcass. The semicircular shadow that occupies it is now pulsing with a warm, amber light.</p>

<p>As you strike the fatal blow, Kekataag gives vent to a scream which rocks the foundations of Dazganon. His body falls to the floor and disintegrates into a mound of dust and rusty metal. From the core of this debris there arises a shadowy vapour which is sucked away through the porous chamber walls. You sense that it is the spirit of the defeated warrior and that as punishment for his failure, he has been consigned by Naar to eke out the rest of eternity with the other lost souls upon the Plain of Despair.</p>
<p>You are elated and exhausted after your hard-won victory, but this is not the time for you to rest nor celebrate your triumph. You sense that Naar is enraged that you have destroyed his latest champion, and you can feel his wrath building to a fever pitch.</p>

<p>As you look down at the ferocious jaws of the three giant arachnids below, you give thanks to your friend Guildmaster Banedon for having taught you this valuable spell. However, one limitation of this spell is that it can only levitate you vertically into the air; it cannot propel you horizontally. The effects of the spell soon wear off and you find yourself descending into the midst of the giant river-spiders. As your feet touch the muddy bank, you unsheathe your weapon and defend yourself against their immediate attack.</p>

<p>To your relief you sense that the dragon is no longer convinced that it is carrying a stowaway. It raises its head and continues its flight towards the construction area which lies close to the main temple. Upon reaching this busy area it hovers above an expanse of levelled ground which is covered with dozens of cargo nets full of blocks awaiting collection by the building teams. A crew of four reptilians guides your net gently to the ground and then swiftly unhooks it from the dragon’s harness using long poles.</p>
<p>From the safety of your hiding place you watch as the dragon flies away to collect another cargo. As soon as the reptilians move on to attend to the next delivery of blocks, you leave the net and make your way as quickly as you can towards the main temple.</p>

<p>The leading creatures snarl like ravenous wolves as they launch themselves at the entrance to your hiding place. You meet their attack with a flurry of lightning-fast blows which shatters their skulls and sends them tumbling from their skeletal shoulders. Their twitching headless torsos crash to the ground, yet more of their hideous kind pour through the gap and within seconds they are all over you. Claws and talons rake your arms and sides as desperately you fight to free yourself from this nightmare legion.</p>

<p>You retrieve the book from your Backpack and thumb through its shiny blank pages until you discover two pages that have changed both in colour and texture. A cluster of rust-red lettering is enclosed within the black runic borders that outline these two sheets of creamy parchment. Once again, using your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, you study the complex text and are able to decipher much of its meaning.</p>
<p>The words tell of Zantaz, the Lord of the Pit, whose many accompanying titles include Reaper of Gloom, Armourer of the Fell Legions, and Guardian of the Gate of Dragonflame. It says that he presides over a ‘deep realm of rock, iron, steel, and flame’, and that among the many eternal duties he has been set by Naar, his primary task is to forge weapons of power for the Dark God’s champions. Zantaz has no secret name, but you are able to translate the text which details how one can leave his domain. It makes for uneasy reading. The Tome states that any who wish to depart must first ‘defeat Zantaz in mortal combat and cast his body into the Pit of Darkflame, from whence he shall be reborn’. Only by proving oneself worthy in combat against Zantaz can one cause ‘the Gate of Dragonflame to release the worthy victor’. The name ‘Zantaz’ is vaguely familiar; you are sure that you have heard it before. As you ponder the remaining text which lists his infamous deeds, you suddenly recall where it was that you heard his name spoken. It was many years ago, while you were still an initiate at the Kai Monastery, and your old tutor, Storm Hawk, was lecturing your class about the Drakkarim: the barbarian race of humanoids whose conquests in Northern Magnamund preceded the rise of the Darklords of Helgedad. Zantaz was the name of the warrior-god whom the Drakkarim worshipped.</p>
<p>Feeling a little unnerved by what you have discovered and remembered, you close the Tome and slip it back into your pack. You sense that the Moonstone is not to be found here in this domain of tunnels, and so you resolve to escape from here as soon as possible. But if you are to do so successfully, it seems you will first have to find and defeat Zantaz, the warrior-god of the Drakkarim.</p>
<p>You get to your feet and continue along the tunnel which leads out of the empty cavern. You follow this passageway for several hundred yards until you arrive at a junction where another tunnel crosses your path from right to left. Cautiously you scan the tunnel in both directions and notice that away to your right, little more than twenty yards distant, is an open archway. Although you can sense no living presence, the angle of view and the darkness of the interior prevent you from determining what lies beyond this archway. To your left, your tracking skills reveal that the tunnel leads eventually to a dead end.</p>

<p>You turn and head back quickly along the jungle trail, dodging and weaving as you run in an attempt to avoid the whipping vines. Through the undergrowth ahead you glimpse the beach, but before you are able to reach it you are brought crashing to the soft earth by a creeper which lashes you from behind and twists itself tightly around your foot. Red hot pain courses up your leg, making you cry out as you struggle hard to break free: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Beneath the coating of moss which sheathes this vine are hundreds of tiny hollow barbs that have pierced your boot and penetrated your flesh. Your Kai curing skills swiftly counter the deadly bacteria that cling to these barbs, but they cannot prevent the flow of blood that is being sucked out of your leg by this vampiric vine.</p>

Yet despite her wasted physical appearance, you detect that she is still strong in spirit and the Moonstone of the Shianti is still in her possession.</p>
<p>You focus on this force-field and deduce that Naar, having been unable to defeat Alyss in combat, has chosen instead to imprison her within this seamless cell of energy in order to prevent her from using the powers of the Moonstone to create a Shadow Gate through which she can escape. The Dark God has contented himself with waiting for her to weaken to the point where she can no longer resist his remorseless attacks. As you focus on Alyss you sense that she is dangerously close to reaching that breaking point. Prompted by an urge to help her, and by the sight of the Moonstone which she cradles in her lap, you move quickly towards the entrance to Naar’s inner sanctum.</p>

Pay homage to the Lords of Decay lest thy soul be devoured by the insatiable horde of Nemagog.

<p>With caution guiding your every step, you cross the floor of the chamber and examine the engraved surface of the portal after a gentle push confirms that the door is locked. You had hoped that the runes which cover this great metal portal would reveal how it can be opened, but to your dismay they merely catalogue (in sickening detail) the evil accomplishments of the Künae.

This sword possesses other attributes which will be revealed when it is used in combat.)</p>
<p>You take hold of Skarn-Ska and essay a few strokes in the air to gauge its weight and balance. It does not take you too long to discover that this is an exceptionally fine blade. You feel your spirits rise, for now you possess at least one effective weapon against the horrors that may be encountered on your quest for the Moonstone.</p>
<p>‘We are delighted that you approve of Skarn-Ska, Grand Master,’ says Rimoah, ‘but you must be sure to use it with discretion. It has magical properties which give off a strong and goodly aura. In Naar’s domain these radiant energies could attract the unwanted attentions of those who dwell therein.’</p>
<p>Lord Ardan picks up a seemingly plain leather scabbard from the table and offers it to you.</p>
<p>‘Here, Grand Master. I urge that you sheathe Skarn-Ska with this. It is woven from strands of pure korlinium and it will keep hidden the blade’s true power from Naar’s foul spawn.’</p>
<p>You accept the scabbard from Ardan and affix it to your belt. (Record this Korlinium Scabbard on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.)</p>
<p>‘The scabbard will shield your blade, Grand Master,’ comments Lord Rimoah, ‘but what of yourself? You are imbued with Kai powers that may readily be detected. There is a danger that your natural skills could alert Naar’s minions to your presence among them.’</p>

<p>And with these words she is swallowed up by the inky abyss. Seconds later, you drop the heavy axe and take a running leap into the Shadow Gate, escaping in her wake barely moments before a pack of screeching, gnawing, parasitic horrors engulf the place where you last were standing.</p>

<p>You reach to your throat, unbutton the collar of your Kai robes, and withdraw the Platinum Amulet by its braided cord.</p>
<p>‘Ah, I see that you already possess a sigil of power,’ says Lord Rimoah, approvingly. ‘It seems you are better prepared for the quest than we had anticipated.’</p>
<p>With a nod of his head he motions to Lord Ardan who then retrieves an almost identical amulet from among the items on the table. Ardan gives the amulet to Rimoah and he slips it into his pocket.</p>
<p>‘You’ll not be requiring this after all,’ he says, ‘but there is something which I’m sure you will find most useful. And I’m certain that you have not come across anything of its like before.’</p>
<p>Once again Rimoah motions to Ardan and the elderly wizard responds by taking up a small package that is wrapped in a silk handkerchief. Carefully he unfolds the patterned silk square to reveal a book which is bound in jet-black hide. A wave of nausea makes you swallow hard as your natural Kai instincts detect that the origins of this book are wholly evil. Ardan offers it to you and, reluctantly, you take it from him.</p>
<p>‘It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,’ says Ardan. ‘A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.’</p>
<p>Carefully you open the stiff black cover and, to your surprise, you discover that the inner pages comprise several sheets of pliable metal. They have the feel of parchment but they sparkle and glimmer like plates of polished steel. You turn through the pages and note that every one appears to be empty, devoid of script, pictures, or diagrams of any sort.</p>
<p>‘I do not see how this book will help my quest,’ you say, as you flick back and forth through the seemingly empty pages.</p>
<p>‘This may be true while you are here in Sommerlund,’ replies Lord Rimoah, ‘but once you arrive upon the Plane of Darkness I suspect that its secrets will be revealed. We of the High Council believe it contains information about the many realms and territories within Naar’s domain. It may help guide you to the location of his throne hall and, with luck, to the Moonstone of the Shianti.’</p>
<p>You are dubious as to the true value of this item but, in deference to Lord Rimoah’s judgement, you agree to take it. (Record this Tome of Darkness on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>

<p>The Demoness and her minions sense that they have wounded you and they howl with undisguised glee. But this sudden lull in the psychic combat allows you precious seconds in which to recover and strengthen your damaged mental defences. When they cease their cawing and launch their second attack, your defensive protections prove strong enough to deflect all of the combined psychic energies that are ranged against you, and the power of their attack rebounds upon them with devastating effect. The Lieutenants of Night fall screaming to the floor where they writhe in agony like wounded snakes. The Demoness reels and totters backwards, slumps down heavily upon her throne, and then grips her disfigured head in both hands as she struggles in vain to regain control of her disrupted mind.</p>
<p>Seizing your advantage, you unsheathe your weapon and rush forward. With two swift and deadly blows you dispatch the lieutenants in passing and then rush towards Shamath’s gigantic throne. Through the red haze of the agony that fills her head, the Demoness sees you approaching. Immediately she slams her right hand down upon the arm of her throne, to where a glowing opal is set into the stone.</p>
<p>‘Gnekasha!’ you scream, giving voice to her secret name, and she freezes as still as a stone statue. But not before her clenched fist has struck the glowing gem.</p>
<p>Suddenly you hear a terrible sound: it is the screams and cries of Shamath’s vengeful legions. With dread you glance over your shoulder and look to the source of the cacophony: the chamber of tunnels beyond the archway of the Throne Room. What you see there sends an icy cold shiver of fear coursing down your spine.</p>

<p>You throw yourself towards the adjoining tunnel, but in your desperate effort to get clear, you trip and fall in the path of the onrushing leviathan. This gigantic beetle-creature flattens you beneath its vast bulk, yet amazingly you survive this collision—but not for very long. Trailing in the creature’s wake is a long line of wagons piled high with grey metallic ore. You are hit by several of these heavy iron carriages and killed instantly.</p>
<p class="deadend">Sadly, your life and your quest end here in the Mines of Zantaz.</p>

<h3><a name="sect56">56</a></h3>

<p>You shout the name ‘Lukha’ aloud but it has no effect. For a moment there is an uneasy silence; then the rubbery mouth of Nza’pok emits a hideous, bubbling laugh. He is mocking your futile attempt to save yourself by calling upon the powers which bind him in fealty to the Dark God. As his foul form wobbles with undisguised mirth, you quickly unshoulder your Backpack and tear open the flap to retrieve the Tome of Darkness. Nza’pok ceases to laugh when he glimpses its jet-black cover for he is aware of its origins and the powerful secrets it contains.</p>
<p>With a terse growl, he gives the signal to his minions and they hurl their spears into the pit with chilling accuracy. You are struck by more than a dozen of these deadly lances and, unlike most who have fallen foul of Nza’pok, your death is mercifully swift and almost painless.</p>
<p class="deadend">Sadly, your life and your quest for the Moonstone end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect57">57</a></h3>

<p>As you pass through the curtain of black flames, the three magical items vanish from your hands. (Erase the Nza’pok Amulet, the Künae Ring, and the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon from the Special Items section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)<sup><a href="#sect57-1-foot" name="sect57-1">7</a></sup> Beyond the flaming curtain lies a hall of grey adamanite which is seemingly devoid of all life. You scour this eerie chamber and your senses detect Alyss’s life-force. Hers is the only goodly presence, save your own, in the whole of this evil stronghold, and although her aura is weak, it is sufficient enough for you to be able to track it.</p>
<p>Guided by your instincts and shielded by your Kai Disciplines, you follow Alyss’s trail as it wends its way deeper into the heart of this citadel of Evil. During your exploration you encounter many of Naar’s newest creations who populate the halls and dungeons of Dazganon. Their repugnant forms and depraved and brutal behaviour provide you with an unsavoury insight into Naar’s seemingly infinite capability to create evil and monstrous life forms. You shudder to imagine these foul beings running loose upon your home world of Magnamund, and the thought strengthens your resolve to fulfil your quest for the Moonstone.</p>
<p>For what seems like an hour, your camouflage and psychic skills make you invisible to the creatures that dwell within Dazganon. It is not until you reach a busy junction at the heart of a maze of tunnels that your skills are truly put to the test. Your senses detect the presence of Alyss at the end of an adjacent tunnel, yet the entrance to this wide passage is virtually blocked by creatures who are bickering with Naar’s armed guards.</p>

<p>You draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen to form a shield around your mind as defence against the risk of possible psychic assault. This precaution proves to be a wise one for, as the net hits the ground, the Dentaag unleash a violent psychic attack in an attempt to weaken and subdue you.</p>
<p>Automatically your psychic defences knit together to shield the fabric of your mind, but the speed and intensity of the attack is such that it threatens to pierce your mind-armour.

<p>As you pass into the void, a sensation of unimaginable speed assaults your senses. You fly through the stellar darkness and a universe unfolds before you, like a million gems strewn upon an endless sea of black velvet. Your physical body is sheathed within a casing of pale white light, and you sense that it is a protective shell generated by your Platinum Amulet to protect you from the icy chill and airlessness of this astral starscape.</p>
<p>You surrender yourself to the invisible currents that ebb and flow through the void and, as you glide across this immeasurable no-space, once more you consult the Tome of Darkness. The transparent page that revealed information about Shamath’s realm is now blank, but the one which follows has changed in colour and texture. Lines of glowing text have appeared on a page that is as dark as deep space. Again, using your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of the text and you discover that it tells of ‘Avarvae the Tormentress’. It reveals that this void, which is her domain, is called ‘The Oblivion of the Tortured Souls’. You ignore the list of her cruel and evil deeds, and search out her secret name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you discover that there is no name to bind her. However, you do learn that no special artefact is required to leave her realm and there are two exits: The Gates of Darkness, by which you entered, and the Bridge of the Damned. Having no desire to return to Shamath’s domain, you put away the Tome and resolve instead to find the Bridge of the Damned. Yet, as you stare across the infinite distances of this void, it is hard to dispel your fears that you may end your days lost here forever.</p>

<p>You draw your weapon and strike out, cleaving through the end of the deadly creeper which emits a high-pitched squeal as it recoils, trailing a spray of sticky green slime from its sundered tip.

<p>You sense that the beast suspects it has a stowaway hiding amongst its cargo, but its eyesight is poor and it is unsure of what it is seeing. However, you cannot take the risk of the beast alerting the Lavas that are flying close by. Their eyesight is keen and they would be sure to spot you.

<p>Through the criss-crossed ropes of your net prison you see the surrounding flock. They are swooping and cawing delightedly, like successful hunters returning home with their captured prey. Above, you can make out the claws and leathery black bellies of the three winged creatures that are hoisting you ever higher into the rain-swept clouds. You are tempted to use your Kai powers to break free and slay your abductors, but a glance below at the rapidly receding ground is enough to dissuade you, at least for now.</p>
<p>For more than an hour the flock transports you northwards through sickly green skies, hundreds of feet above a ceiling of storm clouds. Gradually this cloud cover thins until you are able to note that the swamp has given way to a tropical jungle which is thinly veiled by a swirling mist. A river snakes through this dense foliage, winding its way towards a coastline on the horizon. As you approach the distant sea, the river becomes wider and flows into a delta. Your captors follow the river and begin a slow descent to an islet on the eastern side of the delta, towards an area near its seaward shore where the jungle has been hacked down to make room for a primitive settlement.</p>
<p>As the flock encircles the settlement prior to landing, you are able to make out a cluster of strange-looking huts, seemingly constructed from the hides of reptiles and the bones of huge fish. In the middle of these huts there is an expanse of cleared ground and a large circular pit. The shrieks of the fliers draw an expectant crowd, a score of creatures of two distinctly different species. From the air they resemble gigantic ants and deformed, pale-skinned humanoids.</p>

<p>Two great scaly legs, each tipped with razor-clawed talons, precede the huge bulk of Huan’zhor as he lowers himself down upon his nest of flames. You take cover as best you can among the piles of treasure, but when his talons descend to within an arm’s length of where you are cowering the Dragonlord suddenly detects your presence. He emits a deafening roar and bolts of flame shoot from his mouth to explode with shattering effect among the piles of precious artefacts that lie close to where you are sheltering. Hurriedly you roll away from your hiding place and unsheathe your weapon as you scramble to your feet. There is now no place for you to hide. Your quest and your survival now depend on the outcome of your imminent combat with the mighty Huan’zhor.</p>

<p>Moving as close to the door as you dare, you carefully examine the three small openings and see that there are narrow chutes at the rear of each slot which drop to the base of the door.

<p>You notice, close to the entrance to the bridge, that there is a pulley and chain which is rigged to a stout stone beam overhanging the chasm. A team of five reptilians are busy at this pulley, hoisting buckets of molten lava from the base of the chasm which they then pass along a line to a place where a dwelling is being built. Here a construction team are using the molten lava as cement for their building blocks.</p>
<p>Drawing upon your improved Discipline, you focus on the pulley at the pivot point where it is attached to the beam, and you set up vibrations that, within a matter of seconds, cause it to shatter. The chain and the attached buckets of lava drop back into the chasm causing a spectacular firefall. The handful of creatures who are on the bridge at this time immediately rush to the parapet to watch this fiery display. While they are distracted, you seize the opportunity to make a dash across the open bridge.</p>

<p>The causeway comprises a procession of cracked grey blocks of stone which cross this fetid land and trail away towards a tangle of jungle vegetation that stretches across the horizon. In places the mouldering pavement disappears completely beneath the surface, swallowed by the swamp, yet the encroaching mud is shallow and it does not hamper your progress too greatly. On either side of this swamp-road you notice an occasional spur of rock protruding through the mire. Then you see the apex of a stone roof and a broken spire and suddenly you realize that they are segments of buildings. They are all that remain visible of an ancient city which has long since drowned beneath the swamp. The causeway is not a road at all; it is the remnants of the city’s fortified wall.</p>
<p>The cloudy green sky begins to darken and you sense a storm approaching. Minutes later, a gentle rain begins to fall which turns the surface of the swamp a milky shade of blue. You raise the hood of your cloak and press on, but suddenly you notice that your clothes are giving off wisps of smoke where they have been spattered by the rain. The rain is not water: it is a corrosive acid. Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus protects your flesh from the effects of this acidic rain, but your clothing and equipment are vulnerable to its effect. Rather than risk losing them, you look around for some place to shelter from the coming storm. The only cover that you are able to discern is a large mound of fallen stone slabs several hundred yards away to your right.</p>

<p>You leap to your feet and unsheathe your weapon in readiness to defend both Alyss and yourself against any threat that Naar may launch. You do not have long to wait. Bursting from out of the smoky wall of the chamber comes Naar’s fearsome champion, Kekataag the Avenger. He is attired in battle armour that glimmers like slime-dulled gold, and beneath his helmet there is a hollow skull-face from which emerges a sickly stench that permeates even the foul air of this hall. The skulls and bones of humans bedeck his armoured hide and in his mighty hands he carries a great two-handed axe, its blade stained black with the blood of his countless victims.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fearsome Dragonlord ceases to roar and spit fire. The wounds you have inflicted have weakened him and he is forced to retreat from the combat momentarily in order to recoup enough strength to continue. Before he can strike again, you use the lull in the deafening noise that has accompanied this fight to shout out the Dragonlord’s secret name.</p>
<p>‘Zheva!’ you cry. Huan’zhor shudders when he hears the name, and a naked panic grips his heart. Bleating like a frightened lamb, the great dragon takes to the air and flees in terror. You watch him fly back across the chasm and soar upwards into the vent in the ceiling of the titanic cavern, from where he first appeared.</p>
<p>Your swift and timely use of Huan’zhor’s secret name has routed your enemy but, unfortunately, the Lavas and the reptilian minions do not follow the example of their petrified leader. Sensing an enemy in their midst, they rapidly muster their numbers and encircle the temple.

Then, in the face of imminent death, you suddenly recall part of the script of the Tome of Darkness that told of a secret name which can bind Nza’pok when spoken aloud. This name could be the key to your survival, yet you have no time left to retrieve the book from your Backpack. If you are to use this secret name you must try to recall it from memory.</p>

<p>Using your Grand Mastery, you conjure a thick mist to surround the basalt dais on which you stand. The sudden appearance of the fog startles the Lavas and nervously it backs away along the parapet. It is armed with a barbed trident with which it stabs the air as it retreats, as if to warn off any would-be attacker. You watch the Lavas moving away and then, under cover of the mist, you sprint from the dais towards an open archway at the base of the tower. A spiral stone stairway leads down to a landing, one level below, and as you reach this floor you see something that brings you skidding to a halt.</p>

Displaced air is now rushing past you, whipping at your hair and cloak, and the rumbling noise has grown to an almost deafening crescendo. Swiftly you glide along the passageway, enter the adjoining tunnel, and ease yourself back to the ground (lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point).</p>
<p>A few moments later the gigantic beetle-creature thunders past in a cloud of dust, hauling a long line of ore wagons in its wake.

<p>As the beast leaps from the ramp you dive below it and thrust your weapon up into its chest. The power of your blow deflects the creature and sends it somersaulting into the wall. It howls in surprise and pain, but the failure of its attack does not make it suddenly forget its hunger. With lightning speed it recovers and leaps at your chest with its claws extended. You sidestep to avoid it but it succeeds in knocking you backwards as its heavy bulk glances your arm. Cursing its ferocity, you brace yourself for what must be a fight to the finish.</p>

<p>The first bolts come whistling through the air as you throw yourself behind Shamath’s great Throne of Power. Crouching here as you listen fearfully to the hiss of flying missiles and the screams of the approaching horde, you suddenly notice the waters of the strange pool which lies less than a dozen yards from the rear of the throne. Beyond this pool you see the pair of huge black gates which dominate the far wall of this chamber and suddenly your mind recalls the text which appeared in the Tome of Darkness. This must be the Pool of Sorrows, and beyond it are the Gates of Darkness, an exit from this cruel domain. Your feelings of excitement at having discovered a way to escape the approaching horde are tempered when you further recall that you must spill your own blood into the pool if you are to leave this realm successfully. Without hesitation, you stab a finger against the point of your belt buckle and draw a few droplets of blood. Then you spring to your feet and rush towards the pool. As you come to within a few yards, you flick your finger and a stunning transformation takes place the instant your blood hits the pool’s swirling surface.</p>

<p>You crouch down among some mossy boulders directly opposite the stairwell to the open entrance. Then, using your Grand Mastery, you let yourself slip into the trance-state that will allow your conscious mind to leave your corporeal body. You continue to see your surroundings as they would appear to your physical eyes, but now you are able to transport yourself freely through the air like a bird.</p>
<p>You glide towards the statue and swoop down through the open portal, pausing momentarily to scan the surrounding arch for hidden traps. Detecting none, you continue deeper into the darkness of this alien edifice. A wide stone ramp descends to a sealed portal which is engraved with runes. You cannot immediately decipher them but you sense that they are evil in design and possess some destructive power locked within their jagged forms. Then the sound of a growl, above and far away, makes you suddenly fearful for the safety of your physical body, and so you leave the portal and ascend rapidly to the surface where you rejoin your dormant form. (Unless you have attained the Kai rank of Sun Lord or higher, you lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to the haste with which you have returned to your corporeal body.)</p>
<p>Having already reconnoitred the entrance to your satisfaction, you are able to descend the steps and enter the base of the statue with confidence. You follow the stone ramp down to the sealed portal where you carefully examine the runes which cover every square inch of its surface. You are beginning to fathom some of their secrets when suddenly you hear a noise above and behind you. Instantly you spin on your heel and reach for your weapon, but the outline that you see silhouetted in the archway at the top of the ramp is so shocking that you are unable to close your trembling hand upon it.</p>

<p>The sight of Huan’zhor fast approaching galvanizes you into action. Frantically you search for the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon but you cannot detect any artefact that resembles either a scarab or a wingless dragon. Through the wall of flames you can see Huan’zhor flaring his mighty wings; he is slowing his approach to the temple in preparation to land upon his nest of fire.

<p>You use your Kai skill to command the apprehensive creature to abandon its thoughts of attacking you and run away. The beast’s evil eyes widen with uncertainty and then, in a moment of sheer terror, its nerve breaks and it scrambles back up the ramp. You watch it disappear through the archway before you turn your attention to the portal and examine its surface in an attempt to find a way to open it. Using your advanced Kai skills you are able to decipher enough of the runic text to discover the secret code which keeps it secure. Confidently you press a section of the surface and it moves inwards with an audible <i>clunk!</i> Moments later, the portal creaks open and you hurry through before it slams shut with a resounding boom.</p>

<p>Suddenly you sense movement behind you and you turn around to face it. You see nothing, but your swift reactions do save you from suffering the full effects of a powerful psychic shock wave. The blast glances your shoulder and spins you backwards through the bloodstained entrance to Naar’s inner sanctum. This entrance then closes behind you like a rapidly healing wound.</p>
<p>You leap to your feet and unsheathe your weapon in readiness to defend both Alyss and yourself against any threat that Naar may launch. You do not have long to wait. Bursting from out of the smoky wall of the chamber comes Naar’s fearsome champion, Kekataag the Avenger. He is attired in battle armour that glimmers like slime-dulled gold, and beneath his helmet there is a hollow skull-face from which emerges a sickly stench that permeates even the foul air of this hall. The skulls and bones of humans bedeck his armoured hide and in his mighty hands he carries a great two-handed axe, its blade stained black with the blood of his countless victims.</p>
<p>This terrifying warrior mesmerizes you with his glowing eyes and you feel waves of powerful psychic energy buffeting your mind.</p>

The sight of his frozen form—and the sudden cessation of mind contact—throws his brother-lord into a state of panic and confusion. In a blind rage he utters a curse and, to your horror, you see the maggot swarm emerge from the shadowy recesses of the hall. As the larvae writhe towards you they begin to swell grotesquely in size.</p>

<p>This gloomy cavern looks chillingly familiar, and when suddenly you recognize its derelict features a sense of fear and loathing pervades your mind. It was here you first encountered the Demoness Shamath with her army of attendants and dread automatons. You shudder when you recall how you seized the evil Deathstaff from this place, escaped from here by way of a Shadow Gate, and later thwarted Shamath’s attempt to resurrect Darklord Vashna from the depths of the Maakengorge. The chamber’s cracked and crumbling walls seem to reaffirm your past victory over the Demoness for you can detect no trace of the Shadow Gate nor of the supernatural creatures who previously dwelt in this once-splendid chamber. Cautiously you step out of the transporter beam and enter the cavern. The shattered remnants of the crystal dais crunch underfoot as you make your way across the floor towards a tunnel which gradually descends for more than a mile before reaching a circular cavern. The mouths of several smaller tunnels meet at this chamber, and all of these entrances are dark, save for one which radiates an icy blue luminescence. Before approaching any closer, you retrieve the Tome of Darkness from your Backpack and consult its pages.</p>
<p>The page that revealed to you information about the realm of Huan’zhor is now featureless, but the one which follows it has transformed; it has taken on the appearance of a thin sheet of ice. Sandwiched within its transparent layers are lines of blood-red writing interposed with intricate diagrams and astrological charts. Relying once more upon your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of this sorcerous text. The writings confirm some of what you already know, and they also provide you with fresh information that may aid your quest. You have entered the realm of the Demoness Shamath, the Mistress of the Gates of Darkness. The Tome does not tell of her defeat by your hand, but you assume that this is because it was written long before your recent victory over her and her minions. Speaking as if she were still in control here, it says that she rules this domain from her Throne of Power which stands beside the Pool of Sorrows. You pass over the long list of unspeakably cruel deeds which earned her the right to rule this icy realm, and the revelation of her secret name ‘Gnekasha’ until you discover that which interests you most: details of how to escape from this realm. You swallow hard when you read that all those who would seek to leave the realm of Shamath must first ‘spill their own blood in the Pool of Sorrows’.</p>
<p>You close the Tome and stow it away into your Backpack, and then stealthily you approach the tunnel entrance which is radiating a pale azure light. When you halt upon its threshold and peer through its embellished archway, you witness a scene which both shocks and confounds you.</p>

<p>The canoe grounds on a submerged boulder a few dozen yards from the beach, forcing you to abandon the craft and wade ashore. You soon discover that the stones littering this beach are slick with an oily residue. Your natural agility overcomes this obstacle but the slippery surface makes it difficult for you to reach the cover of the distant tree-line as swiftly as you would like.</p>
<p>As you draw near to the perimeter of trees you pause for a moment to scan the dark jungle undergrowth. Long streamers of moss-encrusted vines hang from the trees, draping themselves limply over every rock and bough, and a tangled mass of interwoven creepers and low-spreading branches forms a blanket canopy which keeps much of the forest floor in semi-darkness. As you stare into the damp and shadowy foliage, you feel a growing sense of unease. Your burning desire to press on with your quest is suddenly dampened by an overwhelming urge to avoid this jungle.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the crater you are relieved to discover that its steep sides are covered with hardened lava, dusted with loose volcanic ash. You climb towards the rim, pausing halfway to take cover from the searing hot winds in the lee of a jagged boulder. While you are sheltering here, you take the opportunity to consult the Tome of Darkness given to you by Lord Rimoah. Its metallic pages appear as blank as when you first looked through them, but then you discover a page that is now very different. Bold black text stands out from a page that glimmers like mirrored steel. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of the arcane script which fills this page.</p>
<p>The text tells of a creature called Huan’zhor the Dragonlord and of his Throne of Power which is located within ‘a nest of fire atop the Tree of the Wyrm’. It lists the many acts of evil perpetrated by Huan’zhor during his long existence, for which he has been generously rewarded by Naar; the Dark God has granted him this fiery domain within the Plane of Darkness. It continues at length to describe the creatures that are enslaved to him, which include the Lavas, the Zarthyn, and the Chugotha. But most interestingly it reveals his secret name ‘Zheva’ which can be used to bind him and tells of a magical item, the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon, which can be found in the ‘nest of fire’ and which can be used to effect an escape from his realm.</p>
<p>You close the Tome and slip it back into your pack. From your makeshift shelter you command a view over the surrounding landscape in which there is nothing that remotely resembles a nest or a tree. All you are able to discern with any clarity is the blazing fire-storm which is now sweeping across this charred land. Fearful of what could befall you when the fire-storm reaches this exposed flank of the crater, you continue your climb and seek cover within the crater itself.</p>

<p>You pull yourself to your feet and listen to the ore train as it disappears into the distant gloom with a sound like dying thunder. When you can no longer hear its rumble, you walk back along the tunnel to the junction where a new passageway branches off to the left. Your gnawing desire to find the Moonstone prompts you to explore this tunnel and you follow it for several hundred yards until you reach a dank and empty cavern. Streams of ore-rich water run down the walls of this chamber, staining them a rusty shade of brown. You are hungry and you decide to stop and rest here for a while. Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>Even though you decline to accept the sword which Rimoah and Ardan have painstakingly crafted, they show no disappointment. They accept your decision without comment or question. Rimoah returns the blade to the table and takes up a sigil of platinum which is strung upon a loop of braided cord.</p>
<p>‘Grand Master will you accept this amulet? It possesses powers which may help you survive the challenge of your coming ordeal.’</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ you reply, and take the amulet from your advisor’s outstretched palm. (Record this Platinum Amulet, which you wear around your neck, as a Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. You need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>
<p>As you tuck the amulet inside the collar of your robes, Lord Ardan picks up a small package from the table that is wrapped in a silk handkerchief. Carefully he unfolds the patterned silk square to reveal a book which is bound in jet-black hide. A wave of nausea makes you swallow hard as your natural Kai instincts detect that the origins of this book are wholly evil. Ardan offers it to you and, reluctantly this time, you take it from him.</p>
<p>‘It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,’ he says. ‘A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was found buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.’</p>
<p>Carefully you open the stiff black cover and, to your surprise, you discover that the inner pages comprise several sheets of pliable metal. They have the feel of parchment but they sparkle and glimmer like plates of polished steel. You turn through the pages and note that every one appears to be empty, devoid of script, pictures, or diagrams of any sort.</p>
<p>‘I do not see how this book will help my quest,’ you say, as you flick back and forth through the seemingly empty pages.</p>
<p>‘This may be true while you are here in Sommerlund,’ replies Lord Rimoah, ‘but once you arrive upon the Plane of Darkness I suspect that its secrets will be revealed. We of the High Council believe it contains information about the many realms and territories within Naar’s domain. It may help guide you to the location of his throne hall and, with luck, to the Moonstone of the Shianti.’</p>
<p>You are dubious as to the true value of this item but, in deference to Lord Rimoah’s judgement, you agree to take it. (Record this Tome of Darkness on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.

<p>Gradually the distant speck grows larger until, with a sudden violent surge, you pass through its white-hot core and feel yourself engulfed by a damp and fetid atmosphere. Moments later your journey ends abruptly when you splash feet-first into a swampy morass. Despite the speed of your impact, your natural balance and agility prevent you from plunging beneath the surface of the stinking swamp into which you have fallen.<sup><a href="#sect90-1-foot" name="sect90-1">8</a></sup></p>
<p>After wiping away the slime that has splashed your face, you cast your gaze out across an unlovely vista of steaming mud pools fringed with dark jungle vegetation. A cloying aura of evil permeates every part of this vile landscape, leaving you in no doubt that you have successfully arrived at your destination, the Plane of Darkness. You look up and scour the corpse-green skies, but dense clouds of acidic vapour hide all traces of the Shadow Gate through which you have entered this plane. Feeling suddenly vulnerable standing waist-deep in steaming swamp mud, you decide to wade through the gluey sludge towards a nearby mound of barren grey earth. Once out of the mire, you rest on your haunches and consult the Tome of Darkness given to you by Lord Rimoah. Its metallic pages appear to be as blank as when you first flicked through them, but then you turn to one page that is now very different. Coloured designs have appeared, surrounded by a ragged text which radiates a flickering spectrum of light. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of this arcane writing.</p>
<p>The text tells of a creature called Nza’pok, Lord of the Mire, and of his Throne of Power which is located upon an islet at the mouth of the River of Flies. It describes the many vile deeds he has perpetrated for the cause of Evil, for which he has been greatly rewarded by Naar. The Dark God has granted him his own domain within the Plane of Darkness. It goes on to list the names of the creatures that are enslaved to him. But most interestingly it tells of a secret name ‘Khula’ which can be used to bind him, and of an amulet which he possesses that will enable one to leave his territory. You study the text for some time and conclude that this swamp must be a part of Nza’pok’s realm. The pages of the Tome seem to hold the key to the hierarchy of the Plane of Darkness and contain information that is needed to move from one domain to another. Unfortunately, not all of the book appears legible at any one time. You close the Tome and slip it back into your pack. Your natural instincts tell you that the Moonstone is not to be found here in this swampland, and, in view of what you have discovered, you decide that you must escape from here as soon as possible. However, if you are to do so successfully you will first have to find Nza’pok, the ruler of this domain, and take the amulet which he possesses. Suddenly your Sixth Sense warns you that the seemingly empty swamp harbours hidden enemies. They are distant but they are drawing closer with every passing minute. You get to your feet and look for the best route away from this mound, but only two ways offer any promise. To the south, you see a shattered causeway of mouldering grey stones, and to the east, you catch sight of a shallow ridge that barely breaks the surface of the swamp.</p>

<p>You shout the word ‘Khula’ and the effect is both immediate and electrifying. Nza’pok freezes, as if he has suddenly turned to stone, and a sheen of grey ice appears on his foul-smelling blubbery skin. Then the iron amulet which is hanging by a chain from his lower lip begins to pulsate with an eerie green light. The chaos-horde are at first stunned by their leader’s transformation; then shock rapidly becomes a blind panic and they turn and flee, dropping their spears and trampling each other in their scramble to get away.</p>
<p>Swiftly you climb the wall of the pit, and as you pull yourself over the edge, you see the mass of humanoids and ant-creatures swarming across a bridge which leads to a neighbouring delta island. Once the last few are across, a rope is pulled and the middle section of the bridge drops away into the river to prevent you from pursuing them. Confident that the horde no longer poses any threat, you return your gaze to its frozen leader. Nza’pok is completely immobile except for his eyes which blaze with a potent mix of fear and hatred. You sense that this once all-powerful being is terrified that you will now enact your revenge upon his helpless body.</p>

It feels as if you have just jumped into a pool of ice-cold electricity: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>The initial shock quickly passes and you surrender yourself to a long descent through a column of glimmering azure light. You feel your Platinum Amulet glowing warmly at your throat and you sense that it is protecting you from the rigours of this journey into the unknown.</p>
<p>Looking down through the curtain of blue light, you can see the roofs of ziggurats and towers rising up to meet you. Gradually you slow to a halt and find yourself standing upon a circular dais of basalt rock atop a large, flat-roofed building. Several yards away to your left you see a squat tower, and to your right, standing at a parapet, you see a horny-skinned creature with wings that glimmer like folded sheets of gold leaf. Your pulse races when you recognize this creature to be a Lavas, one of Naar’s deadly minions. The Lavas is peering idly at the view beyond the parapet and is unaware of your arrival, yet you are reluctant to leave the shimmering beam for fear that it may see you and raise an alarm.</p>

<p>You run to where Alyss sits imprisoned within her sparkling force-field and, with one precise and powerful blow from your magical blade, you shatter her sorcerous prison. The anguished scream of Naar echoes through the corridors and dungeons of Dazganon. As its terrible timbre begins to rumble and fade, you are horrified to see a host of monstrous creatures burst forth from the smoky walls of the inner sanctum and close in upon you from all sides.</p>
<p>Freed from the constraints of her prison, Alyss is able to use the power of the Moonstone to bring into being a Shadow Gate which materializes in the floor of the chamber.</p>
<p>‘Come, Grand Master,’ she implores as she gets ready to step into the whirling black abyss. ‘Follow me!’</p>

<p>You take hold of your rope and make a lasso from one end. Then you cast this loop at a sapling growing on the bank, several yards from the water’s edge. The rope hits its mark and you are able to pull yourself over dry land before cancelling the effects of your <i>Levitation</i> spell.</p>
<p>The moment your feet touch the ground, you retrieve your rope and run headlong across the clearing towards a distant perimeter of trees and dense undergrowth. At first the arachnids give chase, but they are not so agile on dry land, and you are soon able to outdistance them. On entering the jungle perimeter, you force your way through thick foliage and discover the remnants of a trail which you follow for nearly a mile until you arrive at the edge of a second clearing. This expanse of level ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, make your way around the fruits, and hurry across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with a pair of sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door.

<p>As you wait for the rain to abate, you inspect the inside of the hollow and the pendulous insect hive. Despite the seemingly haphazard lie of the stone slabs, the rain does not penetrate into the interior, and the inside of the hollow stays remarkably dry. On the ground lies a thick carpet of soft leathery leaves. They are spattered with a yellow, honey-like, substance which is oozing from the base of the hive. It smells sweet but your Kai senses warn you not to taste any: it is poisonous. (If you wish to take some of this, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as Muntaag Honey.

A crew of four reptilians guides your net gently to the ground and then swiftly unhooks it from the dragon’s harness using long poles.</p>

Cautiously you advance along this overgrown trail, but you have not gone far before you are forced to a halt by a thick curtain of hanging vines and creepers.</p>
<p>Using your advanced Kai Discipline, you command the mossy creepers to move aside and create a tunnel through which you can pass. The reaction to your order is immediate and dramatic. There is a deafening noise, like the sound of heavy tropical rainfall, and suddenly the hanging vines rise up and flail the air. They lash out at you with stunning ferocity, forcing you to retreat back along the trail before their stinging blows.

Shielded by your Kai skills, you avoid the guards and hurry along this tunnel. The deeper you explore, the stronger the sensation and concentration of Evil becomes, but still you can sense the presence of Alyss. Eventually you reach the tunnel’s end at an antechamber, where an open archway to an adjoining hall is dripping with blood. You peer through this gruesome entrance and recognize the hall beyond to be the inner sanctum of Naar’s stronghold—his personal chamber. The walls comprise swirling smoke in which alien shapes writhe and contort themselves into impossible shapes. A circular plinth occupies the central section of the floor, and your heart skips a beat when you glimpse something beyond the plinth, something encased within a glimmering field of energy.</p>

<p>Cautiously you step out of the transporter beam and enter the cavern. The shattered remnants of the crystal dais crunch underfoot as you make your way across the floor towards a tunnel which gradually descends for more than a mile before reaching a circular cavern. The mouths of several smaller tunnels meet at this chamber, and all of these entrances are dark, save for one which radiates an icy blue luminescence. Before approaching any closer, you retrieve the Tome of Darkness from your Backpack and consult its pages.</p>
<p>The black page that revealed to you information about the realm of Huan’zhor is now featureless, but the one which follows it has transformed; it has taken on the appearance of a thin sheet of ice. Sandwiched within its transparent layers are lines of blood-red writing interposed with intricate diagrams and astrological charts. Relying once more upon your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of this sorcerous text. The writings inform you that you have entered the realm of the Demoness Shamath, the Mistress of the Gates of Darkness, who rules from her Throne of Power which stands beside the Pool of Sorrows. You pass over a long list of unspeakably cruel deeds which have secured for her the rulership of this realm, until you come to two very useful pieces of information. The first reveals Shamath’s secret name ‘Gnekasha’ and the second details how one can escape from this realm. You swallow hard when you read that ‘all those who would seek to leave the realm of Shamath must first spill their own blood in the Pool of Sorrows’.</p>
<p>You close the Tome and stow it away into your Backpack, and then stealthily you approach the tunnel entrance which is radiating a pale azure light. When you halt upon its threshold and peer through its embellished archway, you witness a scene which both shocks and confounds you.</p>

A blazing vista meets your gaze, a burning dead world of volcanic magma, boiling lava pools, and shifting islets of cinder and ash. The smoky orange sky is lit frequently by geysers of yellow flame which shoot forth from vents in the uncertain ground, and a hellish temperature conspires with a toxic atmosphere to overwhelm your senses.</p>
<p>Your initial feelings of dread suddenly deepen when memories of this dark domain come flooding back to haunt your consciousness. You have been here once before, four years previously, when your brave actions in defence of the Kai Monastery resulted in a mortal combat upon this evil domain, against Vaxagore, the leader of Naar’s dragon army. You had wished then never to return to this terrible place, but fate—it seems—has decreed otherwise.</p>

<p>You hurry away along a track that winds through the settlement of huts and down to a beach covered with coarse black sand. Here a ramshackle jetty, constructed from wood and bone, protrudes from the lee of a sand dune and out into the sluggish grey sea. Fringing the beach is dense jungle from where there suddenly arises a cacophony of hellish cries. You glimpse shadows moving in the undergrowth, and when you stop momentarily to take a longer look, several arrows come shooting out of the trees. They arc towards you and explode when they hit the sand close by. Your Kai senses warn you that there are a great number of archers lurking in the jungle, far more than you can hope to defeat single-handedly. Anxious to escape while you are still able, you hurry down the beach to the jetty where you discover a sea-going canoe. Without daring to look back, you leap into this canoe, cast off its mooring rope, and paddle as fast as you can away from the shore.</p>
<p>Once you feel sure that you are beyond arrow range, you attempt to follow the coastline in the hope of finding a safer place to put ashore. But a mist sweeps in across the water and engulfs your tiny craft before you can change course. This mist thickens rapidly to become a dense sea fog, the like of which you have never experienced. Despite your advanced Kai skills, you are unable to see through it and quickly you lose all sense of time and direction.</p>
<p>After what seems like many hours, you eventually catch sight of a dark shape low in the water which, at first, appears to be a distant island. You paddle towards it but as you draw closer your senses suddenly scream a warning that you are heading into deadly danger. Instantly you reverse your stroke to change course, but it is already too late. Two slits open in the dark shape and a ghostly light washes over the fog-wreathed ocean. You feel the canoe lurch violently as it is hit by a powerful undercurrent and, in the next terrifying instant, you are sucked into the maw of a titanic sea creature and swallowed whole.</p>

Only moments before you reach the pile, you hear a buzzing sound which makes you freeze in your tracks. Through a gap in the stones you see a host of winged insects swarming around a large, pear-shaped hive. Glinting scarlet-tipped stingers protrude like small knives from their tails, leaving you in no doubt that these insects could prove deadly if provoked. You are about to turn back when they detect you and become enraged. Moments later this host of angry insects comes pouring from out of every gap in the rocks.</p>

He shudders momentarily, but the power and impact of the spell prove insufficient to topple him from this narrow beam of rock and he quickly recovers.</p>
<p>The warrior retaliates by raising his black sword and releasing a crackling surge of electrical energy from its tip. It passes over your head and earths itself to the end of the stone beam, at the place where it joins the chasm wall. You feel a jolt beneath your feet as the beam cracks and breaks away from the wall and, to your amazement, you watch as this solid spar of rock curls up and slowly rolls in towards you, like a snake’s tongue returning to its mouth.</p>
<p>The coiled beam retracts towards the mouth of the dragon-gate, forcing you nearer and nearer to the fearsome black warrior. As he watches your reluctant approach he swings his mighty sword above his head, slicing and stabbing at the air with it in eager anticipation of the coming fight.

<p>Out of a sense of duty and respect for the memories of these three brave men, you pray to the God Kai to release them from their torment (reduce your <small>ENDURANCE</small> score by 4). As you intone the hallowed words of your prayer, you feel an aura of peace and tranquillity descend upon their tortured souls. The twisted and pained faces which adorn the surface of the fiery comets gradually soften and fade until, with an overwhelming sense of release, you detect that they are no more. Through your presence here, and the power of your prayer, the God Kai has been able to penetrate the darkness of this domain and retrieve their souls. It is with a great sense of satisfaction you detect that they have at last found eternal peace upon the Plane of Light.</p>
<p>The comets, now devoid of soul-energy, are drawn back into the orbit of the distant star cluster. You, too, are drawn towards these glowing stars, and as you pass through them at an incredible speed, you glimpse a wondrous sight in the void beyond. A vast rainbow bridge of colour arcs across the immeasurable darkness to a titanic plateau of fire. Your spirits soar when you detect that this is the Bridge of the Damned, the exit that you seek from this astral domain. Yet as you approach the magnificent bridge, you detect a less-welcoming presence. The shadowy riders are returning, and this time they are escorting a creature that sets your pulse racing with fear.</p>

Unless you take immediate steps to avoid it, you could be run down and flattened when it passes through this section of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Desperate for a place to hide, you scour the tunnel walls but detect no cracks nor crevices large enough to accommodate your body.

Among their number you recognize Guildmaster Banedon, Gwynian the Sage, Baron Medar, several of Dessi’s High Council of Elders, and the inner circle of magicians of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star.</p>
<p>Under Rimoah’s direction, these distinguished and gifted men deliberate how best they can help you to retrieve the Moonstone from the Plane of Darkness. A Shadow Gate has long existed in the dungeons below the Guildhall and it is quickly established that the High Council of Elders can, by pooling their ancient skills, use this portal to convey you to Naar’s forbidden realm. The thought of journeying once more to the Plane of Darkness fills you with a sense of dread, yet this daunting voyage could prove to be but one of the lesser perils you will have to face if you are to fulfil your vow. You are sorely aware that once you arrive upon Naar’s domain, not only will you have to survive the attentions of his loathsome followers, but you must also locate the Moonstone and then return with it to your home world.</p>
<p>The members of the secret council consider these problems at great length. Reassuringly, they are able to offer you some practical help in overcoming them.</p>

<p>As you traverse the great Bridge of the Damned, you consult the Tome of Darkness and it confirms your highest hopes and your deepest fears. Ahead lies the realm of Naar and his dread stronghold of Dazganon. The Tome warns those who would voluntarily seek to enter Naar’s fortress that they must possess three magical artefacts: the Nza’pok Amulet, a Künae Ring, and the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon. The final page of the Tome lists the names of Naar’s closest minions who dwell within Dazganon and one who dwells without whose name is ‘Tzor, The Guardian of the Plain of Despair, Keeper of Evil Souls’. The text of the final page states that there is no secret name to bind Naar and, most chillingly, that there is no exit from his dread fortress.</p>

When they see you emerge from a mausoleum close by, their jaws drop open in amazement as simultaneously they recognize who you are from the cut and colour of your Grand Master robes. Upon recovering their senses, the stewards volunteer to escort you directly to Baron Medar’s castle. During the brief journey through the city you are shocked to learn that a whole year has passed since you entered the Shadow Gate, even though the time that you spent upon the Plane of Darkness seemed no more than a few days at most.</p>
<p>Baron Medar is an old and trusted friend and he welcomes your safe return to Tyso with a show of great warmth and affection. Having feared for the past year that you had perished during your pursuit of Wolf’s Bane, he is clearly delighted to hear that not only did you survive your ordeal beyond the Shadow Gate, but that you also vanquished the impostor. Naturally you are anxious to return to your Kai brethren without delay and Medar gladly offers his help. He gives you the finest horse in his stables and assigns a troop of his personal bodyguards to escort you swiftly across Sommerlund to the Kai Monastery.</p>
<p>At the monastery you receive a rapturous reception from the ranks of the Kai, for whom your return is the fulfilment of a year’s hopes and prayers. Firestone, the most senior of the New Order warriors, dispatches journeymen to carry word of your triumphant return to the King in Holmgard and to Guildmaster Banedon, the leader of the Magicians’ Guild in Toran. Firestone had rightly assumed command during your absence and, as he accompanies you through the grounds of the monastery to your vault below the Tower of the Sun, you commend him on how well he has conducted his stewardship of the monastery and the training of the Kai in his charge.</p>
<p>‘Thank you, my lord,’ he says with pride, ‘yet truly I cannot lay claim to all of the credit. My duties would have been far harder to fulfil had it not been for the invaluable aid I’ve received from your wise advisors, Lord Rimoah and Lord Ardan of Dessi.’</p>
<p>These two Old Kingdom magicians—Lords Rimoah and Ardan—greet you the moment you enter the vault. Ever since you disappeared into the Shadow Gate a year ago, they have resided at the monastery so that they could assist Firestone with the task of training the New Order Kai.</p>
<p>‘We sensed that you were still alive somewhere in the void beyond the universe of Aon,’ says Rimoah, beaming delightedly, ‘but neither I nor Ardan were able to discern precisely when you would return to Sommerlund. Come, Grand Master, tell us of your adventures beyond the Shadow Gate.’</p>
<p>Eagerly they listen to your account of how you tracked and defeated Wolf’s Bane and escaped from the throne hall of the Dark God. But it is your surprise revelation that Naar possesses the Moonstone of the Shianti which seems to fascinate and frighten them the most.</p>
<p>‘This is grave news indeed, Lone Wolf,’ says Lord Rimoah, in a suddenly sombre tone. ‘The Moonstone contains great power. It can create life and it can also destroy life—utterly. If Naar were able to fully harness its power he could use it to destroy all life on Magnamund. I fear it is just a matter of time before he fathoms its secrets. The Moonstone was once a blessing for the creatures of this world. In Naar’s hand it could become the curse of us all.’</p>
<p>‘I for one shall not permit this,’ you reply defiantly. ‘I shall find the means to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the Moonstone. This I vow. For Sommerlund and the Kai, so long as I live, Naar will never conquer Magnamund!’</p>
<p>‘Your courage is an inspiration to us all, Grand Master,’ says Lord Ardan respectfully.</p>
<p>‘Aye, to us all,’ echoes Lord Rimoah. ‘And be assured, Lone Wolf, soon you <em>will</em> have the opportunity to enact your pledge, for it is within our power to help you fulfil your vow.’</p>

<p>As the dragon passes low over the derelict buildings, the bottom of the net skims a jagged parapet and is ripped open. One by one the heavy blocks of stone drop from the ruined net to shatter like exploding bombs when they hit the ground. Desperately you cling to the netting to avoid being swept away and crushed in the fall. The dragon caws loudly when the last block drops away and it sees you entangled in its shredded cargo net. Its frantic cries of alarm alert a passing trio of Lavas who come swooping down to investigate. Fearing capture, you leap from the net and hit a mound of dusty soil which softens your fall. Winded and shaken by the impact, but otherwise unharmed, you roll away from the mound and take cover beneath a cracked slab of basalt in the hope of avoiding the keen eyes of the approaching Lavas.</p>

<p>Out of a sense of duty and respect for the memories of these three brave men, you recite the secret words of the ceremony of Kai Exorcism. As you intone the hallowed words, you feel an aura of peace and tranquillity descend upon their tormented souls. The twisted and pained faces which adorn the surface of the fiery comets gradually soften and fade until, with an overwhelming sense of release, you detect that they are no more. Through the power of your ceremony their souls have been allowed to escape from this hellish domain and have gone to seek eternal peace upon the Plane of Light.</p>
<p>The comets, now devoid of soul-energy, are drawn back into the orbit of the distant star cluster. You, too, are drawn towards these glowing stars, and as you pass through them at an incredible speed, you glimpse a wondrous sight in the void beyond. A vast rainbow bridge of colour arcs across the immeasurable darkness to a titanic plateau of fire. Your spirits soar when you detect that this is the Bridge of the Damned, the exit that you seek from this astral domain. Yet as you approach the magnificent bridge, you detect a less-welcoming presence. The shadowy riders are returning, and this time they are escorting a creature that sets your pulse racing with fear.</p>

As his foul form wobbles with undisguised mirth, you quickly unshoulder your Backpack and tear open the flap to retrieve the Tome of Darkness.

<p>Fortunately, your innate Magnakai Disciplines of Nexus and Curing immediately neutralize this deadly plague virus, rendering it harmless to you.

Then the wings beat faster and you feel yourself swinging free from the ground. Slowly the great dragon hauls its heavy cargo into the air. As it begins to level out, you peer down through a gap in the blocks to see the chasm looming nearer. Then you see a river of scarlet lava flowing along the base of this great divide, more than a mile deep. The dragon is approaching the far side when suddenly it dips its huge head and looks down at the cargo hanging below its belly.

<p>‘Ah, I see that you already possess a sigil of power,’ says Lord Rimoah, upon noticing the oblong of precious metal as you withdraw it from beneath the collar of your robes. ‘It would appear that you are better prepared for the quest than I had anticipated.’</p>
<p>With a nod of his head he motions to Lord Ardan who then retrieves an almost identical amulet from among the items on the table. Ardan gives the amulet to Rimoah and he slips it into his pocket.</p>
<p>‘You’ll not be requiring this after all,’ he says, ‘but there is something which I’m sure you will find most useful. And I’m certain that you have not come across anything of its like before.’</p>
<p>Once again Rimoah motions to Ardan and the elderly wizard responds by taking up a small package that is wrapped in a silk handkerchief. Carefully he unfolds the patterned silk square to reveal a book which is bound in jet-black hide. A wave of nausea makes you swallow hard as your natural Kai instincts detect that the origins of this book are wholly evil. Ardan offers it to you and, reluctantly, you take it from him.</p>
<p>‘It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,’ says Ardan. ‘A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.’</p>
<p>Carefully you open the stiff black cover and, to your surprise, you discover that the inner pages comprise several sheets of pliable metal. They have the feel of parchment but they sparkle and glimmer like plates of polished steel. You turn through the pages and note that every one appears to be empty, devoid of script, pictures, or diagrams of any sort.</p>
<p>‘I do not see how this book will help my quest,’ you say, as you flick back and forth through the seemingly empty pages.</p>
<p>‘This may be true while you are here in Sommerlund,’ replies Lord Rimoah, ‘but once you arrive upon the Plane of Darkness I suspect that its secrets will be revealed. We of the High Council believe it contains information about the many realms and territories within Naar’s domain. It may help guide you to the location of his throne hall and, with luck, to the Moonstone of the Shianti.’</p>
<p>You are dubious as to the true value of this item but, in deference to Lord Rimoah’s judgement, you agree to take it.

You detect a surge of anxiety in the mental communication passing between them. The creature seated upon the left throne becomes agitated and begins to flail the foul air with its snaky limbs.

Then, with devastating speed and ruthlessness, a host of monstrous creatures descends upon you from the surrounding maze of tunnels.

<p>As you wait for the rain to abate, you inspect the inside of the hollow and the pendulous insect hive. Despite the seemingly haphazard lie of the stone slabs, the rain does not penetrate into the interior, and the inside of the hollow stays remarkably dry. On the ground lies a thick carpet of soft leathery leaves. They are spattered with a yellow, honey-like substance which is oozing from the base of the hive. It smells sweet but your Kai senses warn you not to taste any: it is poisonous. (If you wish to take some of this, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as Muntaag Honey.

You skirt around the base of the temple until you locate an entrance which is guarded by two armoured reptilians. Using your Magnakai skills you lure these guards away from their posts just long enough for you to gain entry. Once inside, you discover that at ground level the temple comprises just one large chamber which is supported by a single central pillar that runs through the middle of the building. A circular stair winds around the outside of this pillar, giving access to the levels above. Cautiously you ascend the stairs and pass through four levels, all empty. The higher you climb, the hotter it becomes until, when you reach the uppermost tier of the temple, only your Platinum Amulet saves you from being roasted alive. In the roof of this narrow circular chamber you discover an open trapdoor through which you can see a mass of flickering orange flames. You sense that it is the base of the nest of fire, the location, as told in the Tome of Darkness, of the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon, the artefact that can secure your escape from this domain. With bated breath you climb the scorched steps which lead to the open trapdoor in the base of the nest of fire, but as you draw closer, your Sixth Sense warns you that the opening is not all it seems. It is protected by an invisible shield of magical energy.</p>

Finally, it surrenders to death and comes crashing down upon the canoe.</p>
<p>You negate the spell and return to the muddy shore. Once you are free from the mud, you set off across the clearing towards the perimeter of jungle where you happen upon the remnants of a track. You follow this overgrown trail for nearly a mile until you come to the edge of another clearing. This expanse of level ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, make your way around the fruits, and hurry across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with a pair of sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door. You detect waves of power emanating from somewhere beyond this darkened doorway, but you are unable to determine just how deep below the ground the source of this energy is located.</p>

<p>You accompany the members of the secret council to the deepest chamber below the Guildhall wherein lies the Daziarn Portal. It is a perpetual entrance to a Shadow Gate and is one of only a handful which exist upon Magnamund. For many centuries the magicians of Toran have used this portal to banish criminals and traitors from Sommerlund, believing that it led to the limbo of deep space from where there could be no escape. However, in recent years their understanding of this portal has greatly increased following your own journeys through similar Shadow Gates. Inspired by your accounts of the planes of existence which lie beyond the material universe of Aon, and by their own experimentation, the Brotherhood magicians and the Elders of the High Council of Dessi have since been able to achieve limited control over the forces which exist within these supernatural portals.</p>
<p>Using this newly-acquired knowledge of Shadow Gates, coupled with their powerful arcane lore, the council members begin preparations for a ritual which will culminate with you stepping into the Daziarn Portal. Rimoah oversees the drawing of an intricate pentagram upon the flagstones at the threshold of the portal, whilst Guildmaster Banedon instructs his guildsmen in the recital of complex spell chants and the placing of magical artefacts at key points around the chamber. The preparations are painstaking and lengthy. During this period you reflect on the quest you have vowed to undertake and Lord Rimoah takes time to reassure you of the vital importance of your mission. He also offers you some magical items which could prove invaluable during your quest for the Moonstone.</p>

<p>The warrior raises his black sword and releases a crackling surge of electrical energy from its tip. It passes over your head and earths itself to the end of the stone beam, at the place where it joins the chasm wall. You feel a jolt beneath your feet as the beam cracks and breaks away from the wall and, to your amazement, you watch as this solid spar of rock curls up and slowly rolls in towards you, like a snake’s tongue returning to its mouth.</p>
<p>The coiled beam retracts towards the mouth of the dragon-gate, forcing you nearer and nearer to the fearsome black warrior. As he watches your reluctant approach he swings his mighty sword above his head, slicing and stabbing at the air with it in eager anticipation of the coming fight. When you are pushed to within ten yards of the gate itself, you reach for your own weapon and brace yourself for a fight that now seems unavoidable.</p>

<p>Seated on the two throne-like chairs perched upon the back of the rotting carcass appear the ghastly forms of the Künae, the Lords of Decay. They are a hideous sight, and your stomach churns with revulsion as you struggle to comprehend their abominable manifestation. Their torsos resemble two mounds of glistening black jelly, studded with polyps and ulcers and sores that exude a noxious grey slime. They have flat heads that are oval-shaped and shell-like, with puckered mouths and indented eye-slits that radiate an evil yellow light. From their rubbery sides protrude two snaky limbs ending in three-fingered hands coloured a sickly, leprous green-grey. And fixed upon the first fingers of their right hands you see rings of gleaming gold that are exquisitely crafted and embellished with intricate patterns. These rings are exceptionally beautiful and seem glaringly out of place upon the fingers of these grotesque beings.</p>
<p>As you stare at the rings you recall the text of the Tome of Darkness and its instruction that if you are to leave this rotting domain, you must first obtain a ring from the Künae. Your Kai Sixth Sense confirms that these are the rings, and the tunnel-like opening in the body of the carcass is the exit from this realm of putrefaction. Your senses also reveal that the Künae are communicating with each other telepathically. Their eyes glow with increasing intensity and you fear that they are getting ready to launch a magical assault against you.</p>

<h3><a name="sect232">232</a></h3>

<p>Gradually the sea mist clears and you catch sight of land on the horizon. Your senses tingle with expectation for you have now entered a new realm of the Plane of Darkness and you are aware of several dramatic changes to your immediate surroundings. The sluggish grey sea has become a muddy brown sludge that clings to your paddle like marsh slime. Every time you break the crusty surface a cloud of tiny black insects erupts from the slime and soars into the warm, fetid air. The sky above is no longer green; it is a bilious yellow and it is streaked with high clouds that flash intermittently with sheet lightning.</p>
<p>Despite the glue-like consistency of the ocean, you detect a strong tidal undertow. Rather than fight it you decide to cease paddling and allow it to carry you towards the distant shore. While you wait for the current to do its work, you retrieve the Tome of Darkness from your Backpack and turn through its pages in the hope of learning some of the secrets of this new, foul-smelling realm.</p>
<p>The page that revealed to you information about Nza’pok’s realm is now blank, but the one following it has changed in both colour and texture. Lines of spidery writing have appeared on a page that now looks and feels like cured animal hide. Once again, using your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of this arcane text.</p>
<p>The writings tell of two powerful beings called the Künae, the Lords of Decay, and of their Throne of Power which is located upon ‘the rotting corpse of Ghandezh, the Wyrm of Naaros’. You scan the page, passing over a long list of vile deeds that have earned the Künae the right to rule their ignoble realm, until you come to the part which details the secret names which can bind them. The names are ‘Jantoor’ and ‘Rhunadan’. The text instructs those who would use these names in the presence of the Künae to exercise great caution, for if the name that is spoken is not directed at the correct Lord of Decay, the ‘evocator will sacrifice his body and soul and be enslaved to the Künae forever upon the realm of putrefaction’. The text gives no indication of how to identify each of the Künae and does not state how and when their secret names should be used to bind them. Yet it does state that in order to leave their realm one must possess a ‘ring of power’, one of two such rings which exist and are worn ‘upon the first fingers of the right hands of the Künae’.</p>
<p>You close the Tome and stow it in your Backpack. Time has passed rapidly while you have been consulting the book, and your canoe is now but a few hundred yards from the shore. Directly ahead you can see the estuary of a river, and away to your left you note a stony beach which gently ascends to a forest of grey-green trees.</p>

<p>As the beast leaps from the ramp you jump into the air, pivot in mid-flight, and bring your weapon crashing down upon the top of its skull. The power of your blow deflects the creature and sends it slamming into the wall. It growls in surprise and pain but it does not forget its hunger; it simply shakes its bloodied head and springs once more towards you. Dodging this clumsy attack with ease, you let loose a backhanded swipe which slices a chunk of flesh and muscle from its furry shoulder. It yelps and writhes against the pain, but it still refuses to give up the fight. With lightning speed it recovers and lunges for your chest with its claws. You sidestep but it succeeds in knocking you backwards as its heavy bulk glances your arm. Cursing its tenacity, you steel yourself for what will be a desperate fight to the finish.</p>

<p>For a few moments the insects are rendered motionless; then suddenly they re-animate and stream out of the hollow in all directions in a chaotic rush to escape. You watch as the last few disappear into the encroaching curtain of acidic rain and, when you are sure that the hollow beneath the stones is now empty of insects, you squeeze yourself through a gap and take shelter.</p>
<p>As you wait for the rain to abate, you inspect the inside of the hollow and the pendulous insect hive. Despite the seemingly haphazard lie of the stone slabs, the rain does not penetrate into the interior, and the inside of the hollow stays remarkably dry. On the ground lies a thick carpet of soft leathery leaves. They are spattered with a yellow, honey-like substance which is oozing from the base of the hive. It smells sweet but your Kai senses warn you not to taste any; it is poisonous. (If you wish to take some of this, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as Muntaag Honey. You can wrap it in a leaf and store it as a Backpack Item.)</p>
<p>You are busy cleaning the acidic rain from your equipment with a handful of leaves when suddenly your Sixth Sense warns you of approaching danger.

<p>In unison, the robed figures levitate several paces from the floor so that they are able to rest the pillow and phial upon the surface of the great marble table. Then silently they lower themselves back to the ground where they wait patiently for the Demoness to stir from her slumber. After several minutes she raises her head and you are shocked to see that her womanly face is hideously scarred and disfigured.</p>

Millions of evil souls are swirling around the crater which encompasses Naar’s stronghold, and as you watch their endless passage with a sense of awe and disbelief, you realize that this is the Plain of Despair detailed upon the last page of the Tome of Darkness. You stare at the ceaseless torment of these evil souls and you are deeply shocked by the visage of one spirit which rises out of the howling mass.</p>

<p>The swirling spirit of Cadak condenses and shapes itself into a column of flickering light. It now resembles a large candle flame, but one that radiates an icy coldness. Within this chill flame you see Cadak’s evil eyes glowing hypnotically. You draw on your psychic defences to shield yourself from an imminent attack, and moments later, you feel pulses of energy bombarding the wall that you have erected around your mind. You sense that your speedy and successful defence has greatly weakened your old enemy. You are about to turn the tables by launching a counterattack when suddenly you hear something quite unexpected.</p>
<p>‘Spare me and forgive me, Lone Wolf,’ pleads Cadak’s plaintive voice in your mind. ‘I renounce my evil past. Forgive me so that death may free my soul from the slavery of Evil. Grant me this salvation and I shall help you to escape from the realm of the Künae.’</p>
<p>The host of maggots which carpet the floor of this foul hall suddenly recede like an ebb-tide. As they retreat, a glowing ring is revealed lying on the slime-smeared ground.</p>
<p>‘Take the ring, Lone Wolf. Take the ring and grant me your forgiveness. With the ring the way is clear for you to leave this hall through the Tunnel of the Wyrm.’</p>
<p>Beyond the flame-like spirit of Cadak you can see the rotting rib cage of the carcass. The semicircular shadow that occupies it is now pulsing with a warm, amber light.</p>

<p>With trepidation you cast your eyes around the walls of this fiery nest to see a great shaking panoply of gold, orange, and crimson flames. They shoot fifteen paces into the air and, despite your protections, they scorch you with their terrible heat. The floor of the nest is paved with glowing black metal and is heaped with scores of wondrous artefacts that comprise Huan’zhor’s secret treasure hoard. Gems, jewellery, statuettes, armour, and weapons of fiendish design and purpose are piled knee-high all around you. Close by the trapdoor you notice a pool of shimmering blue light that you immediately recognize to be the apex of a transporter beam, similar to that which brought you here from the crater. By its location you judge that it must pass through the central column which supports the nest and the temple below. At first you assume it gives access to the underground levels of the temple, but when you stare into its mesmerizing light your Sixth Sense reveals otherwise. This transporter beam leads to another realm within the Plane of Darkness.</p>
<p>Mindful of your purpose here, hurriedly you search the treasure hoard for the Scarab that will enable you to escape safely from this hellish domain. As you are sifting through the hundreds of artefacts, you suddenly hear a distant screech that is distinctively different from the coarse cawing of the passing Lavas. Through the flickering wall of flames you glimpse the outline of a gigantic dragon as it emerges from a vent in the roof on the far side of the chasm. Immediately, a deathly silence fills the great cavern as the Lavas and reptilians cease their activities and bow in deference to their master. Your pulse races when you see this monstrous creature come gliding across the chasm towards the temple for you know that he is Huan’zhor the Dragonlord, the ruler of this realm of fire, and he is fast returning to his nest.</p>

<p>You recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Levitation</i> and feel yourself rise up into the tangle of ceiling joists above. Hurriedly you wedge yourself between a support beam and the rough rock-face. Then, seconds later, you glimpse the back of the gigantic beetle-creature as it thunders through the tunnel just a few feet below where you are hiding.

<p>The moment you hit the ground, you stagger forwards and throw yourself behind Shamath’s great Throne of Power. Crouching here, with fear running cold in your veins as you listen to the hiss of flying missiles and the screams of the approaching horde, you suddenly notice the waters of the strange pool which lies no more than a dozen yards from the rear of the throne. Beyond this pool you see the pair of huge black gates which dominate the far wall of this chamber and suddenly your mind recalls the text which appeared in the Tome of Darkness. This must be the Pool of Sorrows, and beyond it are the Gates of Darkness, an exit from this cruel domain. Your feelings of excitement at having discovered a way to escape the approaching horde are tempered when you further recall that you must spill your own blood into the pool if you are to leave this realm successfully. Without hesitation, you spring to your feet and rush towards the pool. As you come to within a few yards, you flick your grazed right palm and a stunning transformation takes place when a few droplets of your blood hit the pool’s swirling surface.</p>

<p>You unsheathe your magical sword and a halo of light engulfs its razor-sharp blade, illuminating the surrounding gloom of the chasm. The towering warrior roars with anger as the light from your sword washes over him; it is as if its goodly glow is causing him great pain. He bellows a phrase in the Dark Tongue and suddenly his broadsword is sheathed with a black fire that crackles and spits venomously. Then the cruel dagger clenched in his left hand begins to glow red. When its poisoned tip becomes white hot it emits a trail of noxious steam.</p>
<p>With a maniacal yell the warrior raises both of his weapons and strides forward, stabbing and slicing wildly as he advances upon you. The first blow from his sword hits your blade with such power that you are thrown back as far as the coiling tongue of rock will allow.

<p>Hurriedly you retrieve the Potion from your pack for you recall that Shamath had intended to use this preparation to enact her revenge upon Avarvae. With the memory of the Demoness’s words lingering prophetically in your ears, you pull out the stopper which seals the glass phial and hurl the golden fluid into the sneering face of the Tormentress.</p>
<p>Avarvae’s scream echoes to the furthest corners of her vast domain. With her hands clutched to her face, the wounded Tormentress soars like a meteor into the darkness above and disappears completely, leaving her carriage and her escort of outriders dazed and confused in her wake. The sound of Avarvae’s terrible scream followed by her sudden rout shatters their nerve. Quickly they wheel their steeds about and, with Avarvae’s chariot in tow, they flee across the cosmic starscape in search of their immortal mistress.</p>

Using your Kai camouflage skills to stay hidden from the Lavas and dragons that soar overhead, you are able to make your way undetected to a group of rock mounds that overlook the chasm. Here you take cover behind a mound of broken rocks and settle down to observe the bridge. You note that the traffic flowing across it is not constant; there are occasional periods when the bridge is empty. However, it is exposed to the air for its entire length, some five hundred yards, and it would be difficult for anyone on the bridge to avoid being seen by the creatures who fly back and forth across the chasm. At length you determine that if you are going to make a successful crossing here, you must first wait until the bridge is clear and then you must cause some kind of diversion that will draw away the unwanted attention of the Lavas and dragons.</p>

It was in Mogaruith, in the antechamber to Arch Druid Cadak’s Throne Hall.</p>
<p>You magnify your vision and focus on the runes that decorate the floor. They are similar to those you encountered on the portal to this subterranean labyrinth when first you entered, and you feel your pulse quicken when slowly you are able to decipher part of their meaning:</p>
<p>‘Ye who seek entry to the Hall of the Künae, renounce all falsehood and trickery for thou art transparent beneath our gaze. Pay homage to the Lords of Decay lest thy soul be devoured by the insatiable horde of Nemagog. Place gold within the circle for thy wish to be fulfilled, base metal without for thy fate to be sealed.’</p>
<p>With great caution, you cross the floor of the chamber and examine the engraved surface of the portal after a gentle push confirms that the door is locked. You were hoping that the runes which cover this great metal portal would reveal how it can be opened, but to your dismay they merely catalogue (in sickening detail) the evil accomplishments of the Künae.

<p>Before the Demoness and her Lieutenants of Night can focus their attack, you use your improved Kai Discipline to launch a hasty psychic assault on all three beings simultaneously. Your rapid bolts of psychic power penetrate their defences and short-circuit their minds with devastating effect. The Lieutenants of Night fall screaming to the floor where they writhe in agony like wounded snakes. The Demoness reels and totters backwards, slumps down heavily upon her throne, and then grips her disfigured head with both hands as she struggles in vain to regain control of her mind.</p>
<p>Seizing your advantage, you unsheathe your weapon and rush forward. With two swift and deadly blows you dispatch the lieutenants in passing and then rush towards Shamath’s gigantic throne. Through the red haze of the agony that fills her head, the Demoness sees you approaching. Immediately she slams her right hand down upon the arm of her throne, to where a glowing opal is set into the stone.</p>
<p>‘Gnekasha!’ you scream, giving voice to her secret name, and she freezes as still as a stone statue. But not before her clenched fist has struck the glowing gem.</p>
<p>Suddenly you hear a terrible sound: it is the screams and cries of Shamath’s vengeful legions.

Vile saliva drips from its fangs and snout, and an evil sound—part snickering, part bubbling—issues from its massive jaw.</p>

<p>Through a square hole in the wall of the tower, you catch your first clear view of this subterranean domain which lies deep beneath the crater. Nestling within a colossal cavern of crimson lava-rock, you look out across an alien city that is split in two by a steep-sided chasm. Lavas swoop back and forth across this divide while their wingless comrades traverse it by means of a narrow bridge constructed from blocks of blue-grey basalt. As you stare at the stubby towers and flat-roofed dwellings clustered on either side, your heart suddenly skips a beat. Perched upon a vast mound of shiny black cubes on the far side of the chasm you see a temple. Carvings of dragons embellish its angular surfaces, engraved in such a fashion that their scaly bodies lie recumbent around the base of the edifice whilst their tails writhe towards its highest level. Here they become entwined to form a twisted stem. Atop this stem, like branches fanning out above the trunk of a petrified tree, you see an inverted cupola of bright orange flames: a nest of fire. Your senses confirm that you have found the lair of Huan’zhor the Dragonlord, as revealed in the Tome of Darkness. This is the nest of fire which lies upon the Tree of the Wyrm, and it is here that you will find the scarab that will allow you to leave Huan’zhor’s hellish domain. Quietly you resolve to reach the distant temple and achieve this aim.</p>
<p>You magnify your vision and your hopes rise when you see that both the fiery nest and the temple appear to be uninhabited. However, your enthusiasm is soon tempered when you consider how you can reach the far side undetected. For several minutes you observe the Lavas flying over the chasm and the traffic of wingless reptilians who cross via the bridge. The construction of new dwellings is taking place on the far side and the Lavas are busy overseeing the transportation of building blocks from a quarry situated close to the tower in which you are standing. Under the direction of the Lavas, a steady convoy of winged dragons transports these quarried blocks across the chasm in great nets which are slung beneath their bellies. As you watch this activity, you formulate two ways of reaching the far side. You could attempt to cross the bridge during a lull in the traffic, or you could try to stow away in one of the nets being ferried across by the lumbering dragons.</p>

You release your missile and it whistles down to pierce the creature’s neck, penetrating so deeply that only the tail flights of the Arrow remain visible. The beast shrieks and collapses lifelessly into the mud. Your second Arrow also finds its mark, slaying the second creature while it is still stunned by the death of its companion. But the third and last creature proves to be no easy target. Despite the swift demise of its two companions it refuses to run away.

<p>As you hurtle through the void of the Shadow Gate, you fight to keep your eyes fixed on a tiny mote of light which glimmers tantalizingly in the dark, immeasurable distance. You quickly sense that your passage through this astral corridor is being guided by the combined efforts of the magicians you have left behind at the entrance to the Daziarn Portal. Using their psychic powers they are attempting to steer your body through a maze of invisible channels towards the remote speck of light. The journey is a painful one for each shift in direction places an agonizing strain upon your body.

<p>Beyond the archway you see a vaulted cavern ringed by pillars of ice. A huge marble throne and a table of carved marble stand before two massive black gates which gleam like polished jet. Located behind the throne, and within an arm’s length of the grand gates, you glimpse a well-like pool set flush into the frosted cavern floor. The surface of this well is seething and swirling, as if its black waters were about to bubble and boil over.</p>
<p>The sight of this wondrous cavern is a stunning spectacle, yet it pales in comparison to the visage of the creature which is occupying the massive marble throne.</p>

<p>From out of the dark earth surrounding your hiding place there arise monstrous shapes, alien beings long dead and buried yet cruelly denied an eternal rest. Muddy tatters of flesh hang from their pitted skeletal frames, and from their skull-mouths writhe wormy tongues riddled with decay. Numb with shock, you watch as this ghoulish legion draws itself to the surface and comes shambling towards you, driven on by the hellish cries of the swooping fliers.</p>
<p>Instinct and training trigger you to draw your weapon in readiness to meet this sickening corpse-horde, yet before they begin their attack, you are faced by a threat from another quarter. One of the flying creatures circling above is clutching in its claws a length of chain to which is attached a smoking bundle. Suddenly this creature dives out of the clouds and comes swooping down over the horde towards you. At the last minute it pulls up to avoid crashing into the stone slabs of the roof and, as it does so, it releases the chain. The bundle hits the soft ground once and then bounces through the narrow entrance of your hiding place.</p>

<p>The few remaining insects that survive your blows hurriedly flee across the swamp and disappear into a curtain of acidic rain. Mindful of the damage this rain is inflicting upon your clothes and equipment, you turn and run back towards the pile of fallen slabs. The hollow beneath these stones is now empty of insects and so you squeeze yourself through a gap and take shelter here.</p>
<p>As you wait for the rain to abate, you inspect the inside of the hollow and the pendulous insect hive. Despite the seemingly haphazard lie of the stone slabs, the rain does not penetrate into the interior, and the inside of the hollow stays remarkably dry. On the ground lies a thick carpet of soft leathery leaves. They are spattered with a yellow, honey-like substance which is oozing from the base of the hive. It smells sweet but your Kai senses warn you not to taste any: it is poisonous. (If you wish to take some of this, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as Muntaag Honey.

Crouching here with fear running cold in your veins, you listen to the hiss of the first crossbow bolts and the screams of the approaching horde. Then you notice the waters of the strange pool which lies no more than a dozen yards away from the throne. Beyond this pool you see the pair of huge black gates which dominates the far wall of the chamber and suddenly you recall the text which appeared in the Tome of Darkness. This is the Pool of Sorrows, and beyond it lie the Gates of Darkness, an exit from this cruel domain. Your feelings of excitement at having discovered a way to escape the approaching horde are tempered when you further recall that you must spill your own blood into the pool if you are to leave this realm successfully.</p>
<p>With little hesitation, you stab a finger against the point of your belt buckle and draw a few droplets of blood. Then you spring to your feet and rush towards the pool.

Droplets of saliva spray the back of your legs, leaving tiny white stains where it instantly removes the checked dyes from your breeches.

<p>The net spills open as it touches the ground beside the yawning pit, enabling you quickly to disentangle yourself and unsheathe a weapon. Freed from the net but still trembling from the residual effects of psychic shock, you drop to one knee to steady yourself as you try to assess your situation. You look around for a way to escape from this alien settlement but all that you can see is an encircling wall of hideous humanoid mutants and ant-creatures. A tight wedge, comprising a dozen of these creatures, gibbers excitedly as it rushes forwards with frightening speed. You attempt to stand and meet their attack, but they hit you before you are fully upright and knock you headlong into the pit.</p>
<p>Cursing your luck, you struggle to your feet amongst a deep carpet of bones and look up at the rim of the pit, some fifteen feet above. An unbroken line of ghastly faces are shrieking and staring back at you with unconcealed glee. Suddenly, the faces fall silent and a gap appears in their ranks to allow access to their hideous leader. You swallow hard to suppress the rising nausea you feel upon seeing this creature’s grotesque features. Its body resembles a huge bloated bubble, endowed with a misshapen humanoid face, like that moulded by a child from wet clay. Its pustulant raw skin is studded with warts and tufts of rust-coloured hair. Chuckling maniacally, it drags itself around the edge of the pit by means of six claw-tipped tentacles and you note, with disgust, that it leaves a trail of steaming grey slime wherever it passes. Through its bulbous lower lip there hangs a chain to which is attached an amulet, seemingly crafted of iron. You magnify your vision and see that an inscription on this crude amulet bears the name ‘Nza’pok’. Instantly you recall the text of the Tome of Darkness and realize that this creature must be Nza’pok himself, the ruler of this territory within the Plane of Darkness.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XVIII]</div>
<p>Nza’pok opens his crooked mouth to reveal several rows of rotting jagged teeth. Then words of the Dark Tongue rumble from his gullet to send shivers down your spine. You suspect that he is commanding his followers to slay you and your worst fears are confirmed when you witness spears being passed overhead to the front ranks of his chaos-horde. The humanoids snatch them up in their twisted hands and raise them in readiness to hurl at you upon the word of command from their hellish leader.</p>

<p>You land on the muddy shore and struggle towards the bank. Once you are free from the mire, you set off across the clearing towards the distant perimeter of jungle where you happen upon the remnants of a track. You follow this overgrown trail for nearly a mile until you come to the edge of another clearing. This expanse of level ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, make your way around the fruits, and hurry across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with a pair of sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door.

<p>As you are brought closer to the settlement, you see that the pale humanoids look chillingly similar to the horde of undead beings which attempted to slay you at the stone shelter. This slobbering, shambling crowd is a repulsive spectacle, yet they pale in comparison to the terrible sight of their companion ant creatures.</p>
<p>An icy shiver runs through your body the moment you catch your first clear view of these huge insectoids. They possess long spindly limbs and shiny shell-like bodies, and each one has a ghoulish head implanted with composite eyes. As you descend into their midst they chitter excitedly and fix you with a cruel and hungry stare.</p>

<p>Icy fingers of fear grip your heart when you see the huge, dread form of the Demoness Shamath seated upon the marble throne. She is slumped forward over the adjacent table, her face buried in her crossed arms as if she is asleep. The few remaining parts of her body which are visible appear to be sheathed in sections of shiny black armour. You note that it is the same armour she wore when you defeated her five years ago.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound of approaching footsteps echoes from one of the nearby tunnels. Anxious to avoid the risk of a confrontation, you slip into Shamath’s chamber and take cover behind one of the icy pillars that encircle the walls. Moments later, you see two robed figures glide into the chamber. They are carrying between them a large phial of golden fluid which rests upon a pillow of purple silk. As they pass close by your hiding place, you hastily call upon your Kai skills to mask your physical and mental presence.</p>

<p>Beneath the coating of moss which sheathes them are hundreds of tiny hollow barbs, easily capable of ripping flesh to shreds. One passes close to your face and you strike out at it, cutting it in half. It emits a high-pitched squeal as it recoils, trailing a spray of sticky green slime from its sundered tip. As if enraged by their companion’s cry of pain, the other vines come snaking towards you with increased tenacity. You must fight them.</p>

He invites you to inspect these items and Lord Ardan steps aside to allow you a closer look. The first object to catch your eye is a double-edged sword with a jewel-encrusted hilt. The blade looks exceptionally sharp and appears to have been crafted from a rich golden alloy. It shimmers brightly, like sunlight on water, even in the gloom of this torchlit chamber.</p>
<p>‘This is “Skarn-Ska”,’ says Rimoah proudly. ‘It was crafted by Lord Ardan and myself in the weapons forge at the Kai Monastery, during your absence. It was tempered in spell-fire and is imbued with Old Kingdom magic. It will never lose its razor-keen edge. There are few blades better suited to the slaying of the Dark God’s foul spawn than this.’</p>

<p>You shout the name ‘Rhunadan’ and the remaining Künae immediately ceases to move. All trace of its psychic energy vanishes and its flailing limbs become frozen in mid-air, lending it the semblance of a petrified tree. The advancing horde of maggots rapidly shrink to their former size and retreat before you, seeking the safety of the hall’s furthest corners. The power which drove them and caused them to mutate has suddenly disappeared and they are thrown into chaos. You stride towards the carcass and swallow hard as you step through the ancient rotting remains that ooze from its rib cage. You raise your weapon and, with one swift blow, you sever the fingers of the Künae’s right hand and quickly retrieve the gold ring.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a squeal of hinges draws your attention to the great portal on the far side of the hall. It swings open to reveal an angry horde of corpse-creatures who stagger into the chamber and come surging towards the carcass. They are the Dregants, a decomposing army of humanoids enslaved to the Künae. They have sensed their rulers’ plight and have flooded here in their hundreds to protect them.

<p>You hurry away along a track that winds through the settlement of huts and down to a beach covered with coarse black sand. Here a ramshackle jetty, constructed from wood and bone, protrudes from the lee of a sand dune and out into the sluggish grey sea. Fringing the beach is dense jungle from where there suddenly arises a cacophony of hellish cries. You glimpse shadows moving in the undergrowth, and when you stop momentarily to take a longer look, several arrows come shooting out of the trees. They arc towards you and explode when they hit the sand close by. Your Kai senses warn you that there are a great number of archers lurking in the jungle, far more than you can hope to defeat single-handedly. Anxious to escape while you are still able, you hurry down the beach to the jetty where you discover a sea-going canoe. Without daring to look back, you leap into this canoe, cast off its mooring rope, and paddle as fast as you can away from the shore.</p>
<p>Once you feel sure that you are beyond arrow range, you attempt to follow the coastline in the hope of finding a safer place to put ashore. But a mist sweeps in across the water and engulfs your tiny craft before you can change course. This mist thickens rapidly to become a dense sea fog, the like of which you have never experienced. Despite your advanced Kai skills, you are unable to see through it and quickly you lose all sense of time and direction.</p>
<p>After what seems like many hours, you eventually catch sight of a dark shape low in the water which, at first, appears to be a distant island. You paddle towards it but as you draw closer you sense that all is not what it seems. Then you feel a warm glow radiating from the pocket of your robe and discover that it is the Nza’pok Amulet. Carefully you remove it and, guided purely by instinct, you hold this glowing disc of iron above your head. In the distance you can hear the sound of rushing water which is followed by an incredible sight: the island is sinking slowly into the sea. In less than a minute it has completely disappeared without trace. The amulet no longer glows and so you slip it back into your pocket before continuing your eerie voyage across this uncharted ocean.</p>

<p>You cross the clearing to a perimeter of jungle on its far side. Here you force your way through thick foliage until you discover the remnants of a trail which leads you to the edge of a second clearing. This expanse of open ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, make your way around the fruits, and hurry towards a gigantic statue which sits crouched among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door.

<p>You retreat from the pile of stones and hurry back to the causeway where you follow the course of this sunken wall for nearly a mile before it sinks without trace into the swamp. Fortunately, you discover a chain of knolls and dry earth mounds by which you are able to continue your trek without falling foul of the swamp’s treacherous pools.</p>
<p>For more than an hour you make your way deeper into this unwholesome morass, yet you encounter no further signs of animal or insect life. A strange quietness overhangs this part of the swamp, an eerie calm which seems to accentuate the aura of evil that is radiating from every mound and murky pool. Progress is slow and an hour passes before you discover another possible place to shelter. It is a tight clump of stunted, thorn-studded trees which stand upon a knoll several hundred yards ahead. You set off towards it, anxious to get under cover even though the rain has already damaged your clothing and equipment. Your cloak is in tatters and your Backpack is full of holes. Briefly you stop to repair your Backpack and discover that three of the items contained within have been ruined. (Delete from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> the items which you have recorded in the last three sections of your Backpack Items list.<sup><a href="#sect330-1-foot" name="sect330-1">13</a></sup>)</p>

<p>Your Sixth Sense detects that the force of gravity is greatly reduced within the confines of this shimmering pool. As you stare into its mesmerizing blue light, you suddenly realize that it is a means of transportation; it is the apex of a magical elevator that could enable you to descend into the vent at a steady, controlled speed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a huge sheet of flame sweeps low across the sky. The crater offers you little protection and its searing furnace heat smothers you, forcing you to your knees. Gasping for breath, you glance up and see that the fire-storm is fast approaching—you now have no more than a few minutes left before it engulfs the crater. Your fears of what may lie at the bottom of the shimmering pool are now matched by your terror of being caught up in the approaching conflagration.</p>

<p>You are deeply suspicious of entering this jungle, but you are equally reticent to remain on the beach where there is no cover. You can hear the distant cries of unknown creatures circling in the high clouds above and you know that it can only be a matter of time before the wreckage of your canoe is discovered.</p>
<p>You decide to explore the perimeter of the undergrowth and have walked almost a mile along its edge before you come across the remnants of a path which leads into the jungle’s dark interior. Cautiously you advance along this overgrown trail until you are forced to a halt by a thick curtain of hanging creepers. You are about to unsheathe your weapon and cleave a way through them when suddenly your advanced Kai senses detect tiny movements among these moss-covered vines. It is as if they are shivering with fear. Using your Grand Pathsmanship skills, you command the mossy creepers to move aside and the reaction to your order is immediate and dramatic. There is a deafening noise, like the sound of heavy tropical rainfall, and suddenly the mass of hanging vines rises up and flails the air. They lash out at you with stunning ferocity, forcing you to retreat along the trail before their stinging blows. Rapidly your sense of surprise is surpassed by a rising fear when you realize that these vines are not plants at all; they are hostile living creatures.</p>

<p>In the blink of an eye you unshoulder your Bow and draw an Arrow ready to fire. The warrior does not flinch in the face of your swift threat and you soon understand why this is so. As you cast your eyes over his body in search of a target, you are unable to detect any chink in the thick plate armour that encases him. Cursing your mysterious foe, you release your Arrow and send it whistling towards his throat, at a point where the scales of his chest armour meet the lower edge of his great helm. The steel-tipped missile fails to penetrate; it shatters harmlessly on impact and the pieces tumble away into the chasm (erase this Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>Having now tested his armour, you are in no rush to close for combat with this enemy. If at all possible you would still prefer to use your skills to defeat him at a distance.</p>

<p>Your precautions prove successful and you are able to successfully mask your mental and physical self from the unwanted attentions of Tzor. Patiently you wait for the demonic being to herd his vast pack of tortured souls around to the far side of Dazganon before you cross the Plain of Despair and make your approach to Naar’s stronghold.</p>
<p>The outer gate of Dazganon is open and unguarded and you are able to pass through unhindered. Clearly the Dark God considers the need for guards here unnecessary for the walls and bastions appear never to have been manned. It is not until you reach the archway to the inner keep that you meet with resistance. Filling the inner arch is a curtain of black flames which crackle and spit venomously. You recall the text of the Tome of Darkness and retrieve from your pockets the three items that are required to gain entry to Dazganon. Then, with trepidation, you close your eyes and step directly into the wall of blazing black flame.</p>
<p class="puzzle">Add together the three numbers which appear upon the three Special Items that will enable you to gain entry to Dazganon.

<p>As you crest the lip of the crater you see that the lining of the cone is unusually smooth. You peer down towards the vent at its centre and your suspicions are further aroused when you note that this hole is perfectly symmetrical. No natural volcanic forces could have created this precisely circular vent and it prompts you to take a closer look. When you reach the base of the cone you discover a circular platform of carved stone blocks constructed around a well-like opening. When you look down into this well you are half-expecting to see smoke, or perhaps the glow of molten lava, but to your surprise you discover it is filled with a shimmering blue light.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Lavas fail to see you hit the ground and take cover beneath the basalt slab.

They are angry that the lumbering beast has lost its cargo and they berate and chastise it unmercifully.</p>
<p>While the Lavas are busy bullying the luckless dragon, you escape across this derelict piece of waste ground and hurry towards the construction area which lies close to the main temple.</p>

<p>The portal opens into a vaulted corridor lined with wall-paintings that exude a crude aura of evil. This procession of gaudy murals depict nightmarish scenes: diseased creatures, alien landscapes blighted with pestilence, hosts of larvae writhing in awful triumph over the goodly forces of Kai and Ishir. This macabre celebration of decay fills you with revulsion, yet it pales in comparison to the sight awaiting you at the corridor’s end.</p>
<p>Beyond the corridor lies a vast chamber, rough-hewn from the bedrock of this rotting land. The decomposing carcass of a gigantic reptile rests here upon a floor which shimmers in the eerie yellow half-light. Bile rises in your throat when suddenly you realize why the floor is shimmering: it is carpeted with a seething sea of maggots. Gagging with fear and nausea, you snatch your cloak to your mouth and steady yourself against a pillar as you survey this ghastly hall. Mounted upon the broken back of the great reptilian carcass are two throne-like chairs carved from black wood. Between and below them, lying deep within the creature’s exposed rib cage, is a dark semicircular shadow that resembles the entrance to a cave. Drawing upon your Magnakai Discipline of Divination, you scan the hall and quickly determine that all is not what it seems. You detect the presence of three powerful entities protected by spells of illusion and invisibility. You feel sure that two of them are the Künae, the rulers of this hellish domain, but the third eludes you. Its aura feels oddly familiar, yet you cannot readily determine its location or identity.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fearsome Dragonlord ceases to roar and spit fire. The wounds you have inflicted have weakened him and he is forced to retreat from the combat momentarily in order to recoup enough strength to continue. Before he can strike again, you use the lull in the deafening noise that has accompanied this fight to shout out the Dragonlord’s secret name.</p>
<p>‘Zheva!’ you cry. Huan’zhor shudders when he hears the name, and a naked panic grips his heart. Bleating like a frightened lamb, the great dragon takes to the air and flees in terror. You watch him fly back across the chasm and soar upwards into the vent in the ceiling of the titanic cavern, from where he first appeared. Your swift and timely use of Huan’zhor’s secret name has routed your enemy. Yet, unfortunately, the Lavas and the reptilian minions do not follow the example of their terrified leader. Sensing an enemy in their midst, they rapidly muster their numbers and encircle the temple. Through the wall of flames you glimpse several dozen Lavas approaching the nest by air from the far side of the chasm. Rather than risk being caught here when they launch their attack, you walk across the floor to the apex of the transporter beam and step in.</p>

Gagging at the stench of the creature’s foul ichor, you pull yourself upright and stagger away along the trail. You are within a few yards of the beach when your escape is suddenly blocked by a wall of flailing vines which descend with alarming speed from the canopy of low branches. You must fight them.</p>

<p>Without warning, and with devastating speed and ruthlessness, a host of monstrous creatures bursts forth from the smoky walls of the inner sanctum and descends on you from all sides. You fight bravely but your resistance is ultimately to no avail; you are captured, disarmed, blinded, and hurled from the battlements of Dazganon out onto the Plain of Despair, where you are attacked by thousands of vengeful spirits, many of whom were slain by your hand.

<p>You draw Skarn-Ska from its Korlinium Scabbard and sense at once that its mere physical presence within this throne hall is causing the Künae a great deal of discomfort. You detect a surge of anxiety in the mental communication passing between them. The creature seated upon the left throne becomes agitated and begins to flail the foul air with its snaky limbs. Then it utters a sinister command to its partner and you hear the words echo in your mind: <i>Slay him, Jantoor!</i></p>

The beast is in mid-air when an invisible shock wave hits it squarely in the face and sends it spinning head over tail to crash heavily against the wall. Limp and unconscious, the beast slides down the moisture-slick wall and arrives at the bottom of the ramp in a tangled heap.</p>
<p>While it is still unconscious you turn your attention to the portal and examine its surface in an attempt to find a way to open it. Using your advanced Kai skills you are able to decipher enough of the runic text to discover the secret code which keeps it secure. Confidently you press a section of the surface and, just as you believe it will, it moves inwards with an audible <i>clunk!</i> Moments later the portal creaks open and you hurry through, slamming it shut behind you to prevent the beast from following in your wake when eventually it recovers its senses.</p>

<p>As you tumble into the dark vortex of this newly-created Shadow Gate, you see the glow of the Moonstone illuminating the silhouette of Alyss in the middle distance. Behind and above, the mouth of the gate by which you entered the abyss is rapidly shrinking. Alyss is using the power of the Moonstone once more, this time to seal the gate in Naar’s inner sanctum to prevent his fell minions from following you home to Toran.</p>
<p>The deeper you fall into the spiralling darkness so it seems the stronger Alyss becomes. Gripping the precious Moonstone with both hands, she extends her arms and glides easily through the whirling funnel towards you. As she draws level, you hear her speaking softly in your mind:</p>
<p><i>Thank you, Grand Master. I shall never forget what you have done for me. Had you not returned when you did I would have forfeited my freedom to the Dark God. And freedom, to me, is the most precious of things. For without freedom I would cease to be.</i></p>
<p>For a moment, the whirling frigid darkness of the Shadow Gate is illuminated brightly by the flaring rays of the Moonstone. Alyss passes the sacred artefact into your safekeeping, kisses you fondly on the cheek, and with the parting words—<i>Farewell, Lone Wolf. Kai and Ishir should be proud. You are indeed their most worthy champion</i>—she flashes you an impudent smile and in the blink of an eye she is gone.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master, for you have braved the many terrors of the Plane of Darkness and emerged triumphant, your quest fulfilled. By denying the Dark God the power of the Moonstone you have won a great and lasting victory which will help keep your world secure. Your achievement will live forever in the legends of Sommerlund, and the tales that will be told of your valiant deeds will inspire future generations of Sommlending to follow the ways of the Kai.</p>
<p>Your triumph over Naar paves the way for your accedence to the rank of Kai Supreme Master. It also heralds the dawning of a new age, when new challenges will arise to test the courage and bravery of your New Order Kai. Under your paternal stewardship, the first of the New Order adventures is about to begin with the return of the fabled Moonstone to the remote and mysterious Isle of Lorn.
