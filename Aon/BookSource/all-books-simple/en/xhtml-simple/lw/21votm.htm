 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>The Moonstone is a legendary artefact that was created by the god-like Shianti. It contains the might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of their divine knowledge. Lone Wolf—Supreme Master of the Kai—has succeeded in retrieving it from the clutches of Naar, the King of the Darkness.</p>

   <p>Now the Moonstone must be returned to its creators who are exiled upon the remote Isle of Lorn in Southern Magnamund. Someone must take the fabled artefact to the Shianti and Lone Wolf has chosen you, the most promising warrior among the ranks of the New Order Kai, to carry out this vital mission. Armed with the special weapons and skills of a New Order Grand Master, you embark upon a secret voyage to the distant Isle of Lorn. However, your mission quickly becomes a life-and-death struggle when you encounter intrigue and deadly danger <i xml:lang="fr">en route</i>.</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


   <p>Sadly, <strong>Trevor Newton</strong>, illustrator of <cite>Voyage of the Moonstone</cite>, passed away in 2002 before Project Aon volunteers could contact him regarding his work for the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated a number of titles for younger readers. His wife has very kindly allowed us permission to use his work for <cite>Voyage of the Moonstone</cite> for Project Aon, stating ‘I am sure Trevor would have been delighted to hear that Joe Dever’s (and, incidentally, his own) work is being preserved.’</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are a Kai Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai—the warrior élite of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>It is the year MS 5083 and thirty-three years have passed since the First Order of the Kai was almost wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. The leader of your illustrious fighting order—the legendary warrior Lone Wolf—was the sole survivor of the First Order of the Kai, and as a young initiate he had stood amid the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and had vowed to avenge the massacre of his comrades. In the year MS 5070 he was to keep his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the base of their power—the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>
<p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>
<p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly reestablished. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS 5063, during the era of war against the Darklords, and you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery at the age of seven to develop your martial skills and the latent Kai abilities which lie dormant in some Sommlending. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and honed to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>
<p>In the year MS 5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf’s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it) the Dark God sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King’s Army of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>The defeat of his minions enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years later he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called ‘Wolf’s Bane’ who was the very image of Lone Wolf. While your leader was engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland in his guise and sought to destroy the reputation and the honour of the Kai. He would have succeeded had not Lone Wolf returned home and pursued this enemy to an ancient necropolis in the Sommlending city of Tyso. There, deep within a subterranean crypt, he and his evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness—Naar’s stronghold—where a deadly duel ensued. Lone Wolf vanquished the foe and discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti. This wondrous artefact was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund had heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund has since been measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone’s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the mysterious Isle of Lorn in Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of Lone Wolf’s eyes had told him that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of Naar.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf realized that the Dark God had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world, while the forces of the Gods of Good, Kai and Ishir, had been held at bay. Only Lone Wolf and the New Order of the Kai had stood in the way of the onslaught of Naar’s agents since the demise of the Darklords.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf successfully escaped from the Plane of Darkness and returned to Sommerlund, yet he knew that the fight against Evil had not been won outright. He realized that he would have to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from Naar’s legions of darkness. Two years ago, with the aid of his most trusted ally, Lord Rimoah of Dessi, Lone Wolf fulfilled his vow by journeying to the Dark God’s domain and retrieving the Moonstone of the Shianti. Upon his triumphant return, Lone Wolf placed the Moonstone in the Vault of the Sun—his personal chamber located deep below the fortified citadel of the Kai Monastery. He had hoped that the fabled artefact could remain there indefinitely, to be guarded by generations of Kai who would keep it secure from Naar’s minions. Retrieval of the Moonstone had denied the Dark God’s champions ready access to Magnamund, yet Lone Wolf knew that there were many lesser agents of Naar upon Magnamund waiting quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding. Undoubtedly they would stop at nothing to retrieve the Moonstone for their fell master.</p>
<p>Within a year of his return home it became clear to Lone Wolf that his wish could not be fulfilled. At first the presence of the Moonstone seemed greatly beneficial to Sommerlund. Crops grew abundantly, incidence of disease and illness became increasingly rare, and the newly-born were uniformly healthy. Even the offspring of the impoverished who, in normal times, could expect only one in three of their infants to survive longer than a month after birth, were all in good health and exceptional in their physical and mental development. The Sommlending called this extraordinary period of providence ‘the Blessing of the Moonstone’, yet this time of good fortune could not last. The power of the Moonstone was a great force for Good, but it was also greatly disruptive of the natural order of Magnamund. Soon death itself became a rarity in Sommerlund, and the four seasons of the year were slowly transformed into one unending spring. Lone Wolf was deeply concerned at the changes wrought by the Moonstone and sought the counsel of his closest friend—Guildmaster Banedon, leader of Sommerlund’s Brotherhood of Magicians. Banedon entreated him to relinquish the Moonstone before the effects of its power became irreversible. To right the balance of nature the Moonstone would have to be taken to the Isle of Lorn, in the southernmost reaches of Magnamund, and delivered back into the hands of the Shianti. Only they, its creators, could prevent its powers from disrupting the natural order of your world.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf agreed with Banedon—the Moonstone would have to be returned to the Shianti. The physical effects of its presence were beginning to attract the unwelcome attentions of those who secretly sought to enact Naar’s revenge upon the Kai. When one of Naar’s agents was captured by a Kai patrol within a few miles of the monastery, Lone Wolf felt he could wait no longer. He resolved to act immediately. Preparations were made for a long journey and, especially among the lower ranks of the Kai, rumours were rife that Lone Wolf himself would take responsibility for carrying the Moonstone to the Shianti. Indeed, this speculation seemed to be confirmed as fact when it was discovered that he had secured the use of Guildmaster Banedon’s famous flying ship—<cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>.</p>
<p>It therefore came as a shock when, early one morning, you were summoned unexpectedly to the Vault of the Sun. In strictest confidence, Supreme Master Lone Wolf informed you that he had decided to entrust you with the task of taking the Moonstone to the Shianti. The elaborate preparation he was undertaking was simply a diversion, a bluff designed to draw attention away from the vital mission that he wished to entrust to you—the most talented and courageous of his Kai Grand Masters.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>) and physical stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 32). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>
<h3><a name="kainame">Your Kai Name</a></h3>

<p>It has long been the tradition of your élite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year’s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
<p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

<h4><a name="nodispln">New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines</a></h4>

<p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor—Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf—you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>
<p>Your present rank of Kai Grand Master Senior means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which you begin the <cite>New Order</cite> series, means that you are skilled in the use of <em>one</em> of the weapons listed below.</p>
<p>For every adventure that you complete successfully in the <cite>New Order</cite> series while possessing the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery, you will gain proficiency with one additional weapon.</p>
<p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 points to any number you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.</p>
<h5><a name="anmlmstr">Animal Mastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.</p>
<h5><a name="deliver">Deliverance <em>(Advanced Curing)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, while in combat, their <small>ENDURANCE</small> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. This emergency ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
<h5><a name="assimila">Assimilance <em>(Advanced Invisibility)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of one to three days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques which make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.</p>
<h5><a name="hntmstry">Grand Huntmastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and they possess great natural speed and agility. They also have a superb sense of touch and taste. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p>
<h5><a name="pthmnshp">Grand Pathsmanship</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by hostile plants. Also they have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.</p>
<h5><a name="kaisurge">Kai-surge</a></h5>

<p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, New Order Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (Kai-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously). New Order Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>
<h5><a name="kaiscrn">Kai-screen</a></h5>

<p>During psychic combat, New Order Grand Masters are able to construct mind-fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="nexus">Grand Nexus</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to withstand contact with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="gnosis">Telegnosis <em>(Advanced Divination)</em></a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far fewer ill effects. Duration of the spirit-walk and the protection afforded to his inanimate body increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="magi">Magi-magic <em>(Old Kingdom Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of Old Kingdom battle-magic. These arcane skills include the use of basic Old Kingdom Spells, such as <i>Shield</i>, <i>Power Word</i>, and <i>Invisible Fist</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="alchemy">Kai-alchemy <em>(Brotherhood Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf and Guildmaster Banedon (the leader of Sommerlund’s Guild of Magicians), you have mastered the elementary spells of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells include <i>Lightning Hand</i>, <i>Levitation</i>, and <i>Mind Charm</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Brotherhood magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="astrolgy">Astrology</a></h5>

<p>The celestial bodies which occupy the skies above Magnamund have long been known to affect the lives of its inhabitants. Mastery of this Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to predict and shape the future by studying the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the myriad planets and stars. The number and accuracy of these predictions increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="herbmst">Herbmastery</a></h5>

<p>Mastery of this New Order Discipline enables a Grand Master to identify readily any substance derived from living or growing organic material. He is aware of any secret uses to which an organic material may be put, and he is skilled in effecting the release of a substance’s medicinal and/or magical properties.</p>
<h5><a name="element">Elementalism</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. By drawing upon individual elements that are available, or combinations thereof, he is able to detach, affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove, or accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, e.g. create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove air, intensify fire. The versatility of this Discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="bardsman">Bardsmanship</a></h5>

<p>Through mastery of this Discipline a Kai Grand Master of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of legend, mimic speech or dialect, and stimulate a wide range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect and power of his bardic abilities will steadily increase as he advances through the Grand Master ranks.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 21 of the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series, you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in Book 22. For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original five Disciplines you begin with, you may add 1 point to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> score and 2 points to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline, your original five Grand Master Disciplines, your Kai Weapon,<sup><a href="#discplnz-1-foot" name="discplnz-1">2</a></sup> and any other Special Items and Backpack Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>New Order</cite> adventure, which is called: <a href="../lw/22tbos.htm#title"><cite>The Buccaneers of Shadaki</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you leave Holmgard on the first stage of your long voyage to Elzian, you acquire a <a href="#map">map of your sea route</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time.</p>
<p>You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterstaff (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bow (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows; record them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Flute (Backpack Item)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />

</li>
</ul>
<p>List the five items that you have chosen on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the appropriate headings, and make a note of any effect that they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and/or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="kaiweapn">Kai Weapons</a></h4>

<p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the élite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>
<p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a href="#action">Special Items List</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Say you choose the number 8 from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Broadsword ‘Illuminatus’.</p>
<p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you were to use ‘Illuminatus’ in combat against an enemy in an underground cavern, cave, or tunnel, you could add the higher bonus of 7 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you were to fight this enemy in any other location, the bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> would remain at 5.</p>

<h4><a name="howuse">Equipment—How to use it</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct Weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this Weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful Weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is best to equip yourself also with a close combat Weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is 12.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai Weapon</dt>
<dd>Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal Weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This is in addition to the bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your five Disciplines, then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency most readily accepted in eastern Northern Magnamund is the Gold Crown. These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.<br /><br />

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
You, Grand Master (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. You also possess the Kai Weapon ‘Ulnarias’, so you add an additional 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This gives you a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 45.<br /><br />
You now subtract the Wild Dogs’ <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45−31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself—Grand Master.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>You (GM) lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
<li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of New Order Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership.

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">New Order Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>You are about to embark upon the first stage of an essential mission to return the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti to its creators.</p>
<p>Some of the material items that you will encounter during your quest will be of use to you, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>‘Understand that your mission must be conducted with the utmost secrecy to ensure its success,’ says Lone Wolf, fixing you with his steely gaze. You nod your head in acknowledgement and watch with growing anticipation as the Supreme Master of the Kai rises from his throne and moves silently across the polished stone floor of his magnificent vault. From a concealed safe in the granite wall he removes a seemingly plain leather satchel which he unbuckles and holds open, inviting your inspection. Nestled within lies the legendary Moonstone, surrounded by a shimmering halo of golden light.</p>
<p>‘The inner lining of this bag is woven from strands of fine-spun korlinium,’ says Lone Wolf, as he carefully buckles the satchel’s leather flap.</p>
<p>‘The mineral will hide the Moonstone’s powerful energies, especially from those who have no need to rely solely upon their eyesight to detect its power.’</p>
<p>He offers you the satchel and you accept it with trembling hands. Yet the moment you touch the bag you feel all your anxieties suddenly vanish and the natural air of calm confidence, for which you are noted among your brother Kai, swiftly returns. (Record the Moonstone on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You carry it slung over your shoulder in its leather satchel.) Lone Wolf informs you that you are to journey 2,000 miles to Elzian—the principal city of the jungle realm of Dessi. There you are to seek out Lord Rimoah at the Tower of Truth. He will assist your onward passage to the Isle of Lorn. In the interests of secrecy, Rimoah is the only other person who knows about your mission. Lone Wolf has arranged for you to travel aboard a Sommlending trading ship, sailing out of Holmgard for Bisutan by way of Barrakeesh. You will be met in Barrakeesh by Lord-lieutenant Fernant, the Sommlending envoy to Vassagonia, who will join you on the voyage to Bisutan where his rank and reputation will help speed the final leg of your journey to Elzian. To allay suspicion you will travel in the guise of a Kai journeyman. At the same time, as you embark upon your long voyage south, so Lone Wolf will leave the monastery aboard the skyship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> and journey to distant Lencia, in the far west of Magnamund. He shall carry with him a replica of the Moonstone to draw away the attention of any who would seek to thwart your true quest.</p>
<p>Upon concluding your briefing, Lone Wolf orders you to go to your quarters and rest. You are to return to the vault at midnight in full readiness to begin the mission.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>You usher the marines into your room and lock the door to prevent the tavern-keeper from entering. Then, one by one, you leave by the window and climb up onto the roof. Hidden by the darkness and by a low parapet wall which encircles the tavern’s upper floor, you stay here and observe as more than a hundred City Guardsmen round up all the foreign merchants and crewmen who are lodging at the quayside taverns. These innocent men are then made to form a long column before they are marched away towards the Funtal’s castle. When dawn breaks over the harbour, this normally busy trading centre is unusually quiet. The only people you can see going about their business are native Bir Rabalonians.</p>
<p>When you can no longer see any City Guardsmen in the harbour, you re-enter the tavern and hurry down to the taproom. Here you find Kol, the Casiornian merchant, enjoying a large plateful of meat and cheese. With a wide grin he tells you that he has spent a very comfortable night hiding in the kitchen cellar.</p>

<h3><a name="sect3">3</a></h3>

<p>You utter the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i> and extend your right fist towards the onrushing creature. A tingle runs down your arm and a burst of blue-white light illuminates the surrounding jungle when a bolt of energy leaps from your hand and arcs towards the creature’s chest. The bolt strikes, and the Deathstalker’s mate shrieks as it burns deep into her shoulder. She falters but she does not abandon her attack, and quickly you raise your weapon in readiness to receive it.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>With the help of your Kai skills and the failing light, you slip away from the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> and return to the Tradewind Tavern. Here you are fortunate to discover the three marines who, despite their best efforts this day, have been unable to sell your horse and raise enough money to leave. They are surprised to see you come walking through the door, but very glad that you have returned. Oswin tells you that a curfew has been declared and that all foreigners have been forbidden to use the streets after dark. The tavern-keeper, who openly hates the Funtal, offers to hide you in the stables tonight in case the City Guard should pay another visit. Gratefully you accept his offer and spend the night hiding in his hay-loft.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect275">Turn to 275</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>With a rousing cheer, the second wave of enemy raiders follow their leader and leap aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. The ship’s crew and the marines have suffered many casualties and they are now too weak and exhausted to be able to repel this renewed assault. You know that you must act swiftly if you are to avert a disaster.</p>
<p>Steeling yourself for what must be done, you shoulder your Bow and unsheathe a weapon. Then you leap from the rigging as the enemy leader passes below the mainmast. You hit the armoured warrior feet-first and slam him to the deck, but he quickly recovers from your surprise attack and, in the ensuing struggle, he manages to kick the weapon from your hand.</p>
<p>‘Leave him to me!’ he screams, warning off his henchmen who are poised to rush forward and cut you down. Slowly he unsheathes his scimitar and, with a sneer fixed to his cruel lips, he raises the blade in readiness to strike a mighty blow to your head.</p>

<p>The village consists of a circle of conical huts thatched with toa leaves. As you ride towards them, a giggling swarm of young children comes rushing from the open doorways and quickly surrounds your horse. They hold open their grubby palms and beg you for money.</p>

<h3><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>You tour the market and one stall in particular holds your attention. It is run by a small and timid-looking man and he offers you herbs and potions which he has gathered from all over Magnamund. As you examine the hundreds of phials, philtres, and flasks that are laid out upon his stall, you notice there are many types of herbs that you have encountered before, and some you have not. Of all his selection, the following four interest you the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potion of Laumspur: restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when swallowed after combat.</li>
<li>Potion of Alether: increases <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 2 when swallowed before combat (one use only).</li>
<li>Potion of Mustow: creates a foul choking gas when released into the air.</li>
<li>Potion of Sebaris: purifies contaminated water (one use only).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these potions costs 3 Gold Crowns.</p>

<h3><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>Despite the frugality of the innkeeper and the drabness of your room, you manage to sleep well and rise at dawn feeling alert and refreshed (you may restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). You meet with the marines and, foregoing breakfast, you walk to the adjoining stables to collect your horses. The innkeeper’s daughter has already fed and watered them and they are ready to be collected. However, before she will let them go she demands you pay her a stabling fee of 1 Gold Crown each.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have some money and you wish to pay her 1 Gold Crown, <a href="#sect346">turn to 346</a>.</p>

<p>You grab your Bow and take hasty aim at the snarling creature. You fire as she lopes towards you and she shrieks as the sharp tip of your shaft grazes her forehead.

<p>When the dust settles you see that the Koneshi Pass is now blocked and completely impassable. You shout to the marines on the other side to let them know that you are safe, and you hear them calling back, but even with your acute Kai sense of hearing you are unable to make out clearly what they are shouting.</p>
<p>However, by drawing upon your Magnakai skill of Divination you are able to make telepathic contact with Sligh. By way of mental commands and suggestions you tell him to lead his comrades back to Bir Rabalou where they are to sell their horses to raise the money they will need to buy passage home aboard a trading ship. Sligh is unable to answer you telepathically, but you sense that he will comply with your suggestions. Wary of the risk of further landslides, you turn your horse around and ride off along the open mountain trail towards the south.</p>

<p>When you refuse to give them any money they begin shouting at you and throwing stones. One jagged stone hits your forehead and draws blood, and another bruises your jaw: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>The screaming of the children attracts the attention of their indolent parents who emerge from their huts brandishing clubs and knives. They rush at you and you are forced to turn your horse about and gallop away. Upon reaching the road, you use your Kai curing skills to ease the stinging pain of your head wound before continuing your ride east towards Hikas.</p>

<h3><a name="sect13">13</a></h3>

<p>You evade your enemies by scaling the mainmast as swiftly as you can. As you climb higher, you notice chunks of wood are raining down from above. You glance up and see that the giant spider is now perched in the crow’s nest, where it is busily tearing at the mast and topsail with its fanged maw. Fearful of what may happen if it should be allowed to direct its power upon your countrymen below, you decide that you must confront and slay this creature.</p>
<p>You approach the giant spider from below and, at first, it fails to notice your presence. But when you pause for a few moments to unsheathe your weapon, it dips its head and you find yourself staring into a pair of ghastly green eyes. It rubs its forelegs together and sparks appear, warning you that it is preparing to launch a bolt of energy. Quickly you cut free a trailing rope and swing away from the mainmast just in time to avoid being burnt to a cinder when it launches its burst of crackling blue fire. Your swift action saves you, but as the momentum of your swing carries you back towards the mast, so you see that the creature is preparing a new form of attack.</p>

The militia are examining their doors and windows for signs of a forced entry but all of them look secure. Then your eye is drawn to a grand temple on the far side of the plaza. Its great stone door is closed, but a smaller wooden door at the side has been torn off its hinges.

You have climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of your spine.

Out of the darkness you see a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end-over-end towards you.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the rest of the crew escape injury and damage to the ship is minimal. Sergeant Dryan commands his men to return fire and a volley of shots from the three swivel guns slams into the bow of the pirate ship with devastating effect. Two shots penetrate below the waterline and the third severs the bowsprit. As it falls into the ocean, it rips away sail and rigging which drag more than a dozen pirates overboard. In disarray, the enemy vessel veers from its collision course and founders in the wake of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> as it enters the Bukimi Channel.

Proudly the Vakeros lieutenant and his militia escort you across the city and during your march you receive the adulation of the grateful populace. The mayor hails you as the saviour of Hikas and he bestows upon you the freedom of the city. He decrees that the plaza, where the remains of the Deathstalker were destroyed, shall from this day forward be named after you in perpetual honour of your brave and gallant deed.</p>

<p>A large wooden platform has been erected at the centre of the marketplace upon which twenty men and women are standing side by side with their heads bowed. These poor wretches wear heavy iron manacles which encase their wrists and ankles. Standing behind them are eight hard-faced guards, each with a loop of knotted rope that dangles menacingly from their wrists.

<p>The creature emits a desperate howl as your last mighty blow seals its doom. It lurches at you, its eyes white in their red-rimmed sockets, its great clawed arms swinging blindly. And then this supernatural horror surrenders to death and is brought crashing to the floor. For a few moments its great body convulses and then lies still. Wisps of evil-smelling gas arise from beneath the fur and you are forced to snatch your cloak to your face to deaden the sickly sweet stench of decay. You turn and hurry down the stairs in time to see the lieutenant and his militia breaking through the rubble which blocks the exit from the bell-tower. His men ascend the stairs and remove the vile, rotting remains of the Deathstalker which are placed upon a pyre outside in the tree-lined plaza. Soon the carcass of this murderous creature is ablaze and word of its death spreads swiftly across the city. The curfew is lifted and a large crowd comes and gathers around the dying embers of the pyre to cheer and rejoice in the destruction of the creature which, for the past month, has murdered their kinfolk and terrorized their peaceful city.</p>

<p>You scan the distant island, using your Grand Master Discipline to enhance your innate visual skills. The shoreline appears deserted, but when you cast your gaze towards the east you notice several dots on the horizon. You alert Captain Raker and he brings his telescope to bear. After a few moments’ observation he shouts an order to Paoll: ‘South by southwest, if you please, First Mate. Looks like we’ve got comp’ny!’</p>
<p>The timbers creak as the ship turns about and forges a passage through deep water. Following the change of bearing the wind is now no longer in your favour and Paoll is forced to tack against it to make progress. The distant ships are now visible and it is clear to all aboard that they are pirate raiders. Soon another two islands rise into view and the captain orders his First Mate to steer a course towards a narrow channel which separates them.</p>
<p>‘That’s the Bukimi Channel,’ says Raker. ‘If we can pass through afore those sea dogs, we’ll pick up southerly winds on the far side. Then they’ll never catch us!’</p>

<p>Your attempt to avoid being struck by the arrow is not as successful as you could have wished for. It penetrates your left shoulder and the energy of its impact is enough to bring you crashing to the ground. The archer laughs with glee when he sees you fall and, with encouragement from the slaver who is screaming at him to finish you off, he drops his bow and leaps down from the platform. As he rushes towards where you lie, he snatches his sword from its scabbard and raises it in readiness to deliver a fatal blow to your head.</p>

Before you can utter a sound, he slams into your chest and impales himself on your weapon.</p>

<p>Kol is susceptible to your psychic suggestions and he obeys your mental order to turn the ship around.

Silently they obey their master and within minutes the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> is sailing back to Bir Rabalou.</p>
<p>You return to the city’s harbour at dusk where you are met by a dozen of the Funtal’s guardsmen who are checking ships along the quayside. Kol recognizes their officer—he is a man called Jhioua and he is an old friend of his. Eventually a gangplank is lowered and Kol steps briskly ashore to engage his friend in conversation. With the officer distracted, you now use your Kai camouflage skills to evade the wary eyes of his guardsmen and escape from the ship.</p>

<p>Dromodon strides into the arena with his arms flung wide to receive the frenzied adulation of the crowd. He is a magnificent lion of a man, with broad shoulders and a mighty chest that ripples with bronzed muscle. His grim face is stern and majestic beneath a mane of wild black hair, and he moves with the confidence and grace of a huge, predatory animal. At first he appears to be the very embodiment of gladiatorial perfection, and you regret that you should have to fight this heroic warrior to the death. But your regrets soon evaporate when you look into his eyes, for you see revealed there his true nature. Beneath the façade of his heroic exterior lurks a soul filled with evil. Your senses tell you that he is a secret worshipper of Naar. The Dark God has given him many rewards—his strength and his status—and in return Dromodon has consigned hundreds of noble souls to an eternity of slavery in the thrall of Naar. Now you see him for what he really is—a ruthless murderer, a heartless killing machine—and all empathy with him as a fellow warrior is lost. This will be a fight to the death and you must fight to win!</p>

<p>For an hour you ride without daring to stop in case the slaver has dispatched his henchmen to pursue you. The hills keep the interior of this country hidden from view until you reach a broad-based canyon bisected by a meandering stream. The threat of pursuit has now passed and so you halt here to slake your thirst before continuing your long ride south.</p>
<p>Beyond the canyon, the road crosses a rolling coastal plain which lies at the eastern edge of the Dry Main—Vassagonia’s vast desert. The undulations of its windswept sands give this great sun-bleached emptiness the appearance of a vast yellow sea that seems to stretch away into infinity. You feel a disturbing unease as you stare across this wilderness for there is nothing to break the view, and nothing that could offer you a place to hide should the need arise.</p>
<p>As dusk approaches you are pleased to see that the road bears to the east and passes within sight of the ocean. The heat of the day has now surrendered to a biting night wind that makes your horse and your companions shiver. Mindful of their need for shelter, you leave the road and scout the rugged coastline in search of a cave in which to spend the night. Your tracking skills lead you to a dry cave that is ideal and you camp here and build a fire from driftwood. Over a meal of roasted crabmeat the conversation turns to Oriah and your fears for her safety. Later this night, as you sit the first watch, you offer a prayer to the Goddess Ishir to protect her and keep her safe. You have a strong feeling that the young woman is still alive and that one day, sometime in the future, your paths are destined to cross once more.</p>
<p>After a few hours, Sligh wakes from his slumber to take his turn keeping watch at the mouth of the cave. Gladly you hand over the duty to him and settle down for some much needed sleep (you may restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>

<p>You watch aghast as the Itikars swoop past the balloon and rake their talons across its canopy. The sudden loss of gas from the canopy shakes the basket and you are knocked off your feet. Yranai falls on top of you and, for a few nerve-racking seconds, you lie entangled at the bottom of the basket as the balloon rapidly loses altitude. When you pull yourself up and peer over the rim, you see the trees of the lower mountain slopes rising towards you at a dizzying speed. Yranai looks up to see shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy above and the sight proves too much for him: he faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap away from this doomed balloon as the tops of the mountain pines rise into view.</p>

<p>‘Welcome, Master Journeyman,’ says the smiling trader, ‘I’m most pleased to make your acquaintance. My name is Kolastemi Ayusidihara but people know me better as Kol. I see by the cloak clasp you are wearing that you are a Kai journeyman of Sommerlund, yes?’</p>
<p>You nod to affirm this and the excited little man proceeds to tell you about himself and his business. You hear that he is a merchant who was born in Casiorn but who now lives in the city of Kuchek. When he was a young man he traded silk for wheat in Holmgard where he first encountered the Kai. Once, when his caravan was attacked by a Giak war party on the Ruanon Pike, it was the timely intervention of a Kai journeyman that saved his life and his cargo. Since that day he has revered your warrior order. Barely pausing for breath, he tells you proudly that he has a ship moored in the harbour which is filled with timber that he intends to trade for spices in Bisutan. He plans to set sail tomorrow at noon. When at last he pauses to take a sip of ale from his tankard, you inform him that you and your three companions are travelling overland to Elzian.</p>
<p>‘By horse? Such a tiring way to travel and such a difficult road too,’ he says. ‘I would gladly offer you passage aboard my ship but, alas, I carry such a heavy cargo that I could only accommodate one extra passenger. You would be most welcome to sail with me to Bisutan, but sadly I am unable to offer such a favour to your friends.’</p>
<p>You thank Kol for his offer but decline it, preferring to stay with the marines. You are tired now, and so you rise from your seat and bid the friendly trader goodnight and a safe voyage. As you turn to go to your room he calls out: ‘If you should change your mind, remember I sail at noon. My ship is moored at the end of the east quay. She’s called <cite>Desert Jewel</cite>.’</p>

<p>You bid Kol good luck and wish him a safe voyage before you and your companions collect your horses and set off from the tavern. The streets of Bir Rabalou are quiet this morning and you reach the city’s south gate without incident. Here you gallop through the open gates to avoid any risk of being detained by the surly guards. They shout and curse you and loose off a few arrows in your wake, but these are poorly aimed and you escape from the city unharmed.</p>
<p>It is approaching noon when you arrive at a junction where the coast road splits in two. Ahead of you are the gentle foothills of the Koneshi Mountains, and beyond them you glimpse the snowy peaks of that great range rising majestically into the cloudless sky. Away to the east you can see the rugged coastline of southern Vassagonia where the cresting ocean waves break their backs upon wild and rocky beaches.</p>
<p>A signpost at the junction points to the east and to the south. To the east it reads, ‘Khor—100 miles / Bisutan—225 miles’. To the south it reads, ‘Koneshi Pass to Bisutan—125 miles’.</p>

<p>‘The people of Hikas are living in fear of their lives,’ says the innkeeper, as he draws up a chair and sits with you at your table. ‘For the past month there’s been a creature stalking our streets at night. It’s killed more than fifty poor souls, and in terrible fashion. Ripped ’em to pieces. There ain’t anyone who’s lived to tell what it looks like but everyone’s got their own ideas. Some say it’s a shape-changer that goes about at day in the guise of a man and changes into a beast at night. Others say it’s come from Gorgoron, seeking revenge on the Old Kingdom for the death of its master—Agarash the Damned. I…I don’t know what to think. All I know is that it stalks the streets, and every night someone dies a ghastly death by its hand.’</p>
<p>Suddenly the door to the tavern opens and in strides a Vakeros soldier with a sword wavering in his hand. He is wearing the uniform of a lieutenant of the city’s militia, and beside him is a small boy—the innkeeper’s son. ‘That’s him!’ shouts the boy, pointing his finger accusingly at you.</p>
<p>The innkeeper vouches to the nervous lieutenant that you are a journeyman and not the creature that has paralysed Hikas with a reign of terror. The lieutenant relaxes a little and sheathes his sword. He shouts to a unit of his guardsmen who are grouped outside to form into a column and get ready to march, and then he turns to you and asks you to accompany him.</p>

<p>The enemy ship is less than a hundred yards off the port beam when you see the dark shape at its prow begin to twitch and shudder. At first it resembles the body of some grotesque gigantic tick; then eight rubbery legs spring from its black underbelly and suddenly the shape takes on a far more sinister aspect.</p>
<p>A gasp of terror arises from the crew when this spider-like monstrosity opens its scarlet maw and emits a high-pitched chittering shriek. As the enemy vessel speeds nearer you watch with mounting dread as this hideous spider-creature raises its forelegs, as if in readiness to pounce. Furiously it rubs its forelimbs together and a mass of blue-white sparks appear at their tips. Then suddenly there is a deafening crackle of electrical power. A bolt of blazing energy shoots from the creature’s maw and snakes across the water towards the crew and marines aboard your ship. The creature’s attack hits its mark and the effect is swift and devastating. The crackling bolt ignites timber and sail, and leaves a dozen men sprawled dead or unconscious across the decks. Through the smoke of the burning sailcloth you see the enemy vessel bearing down to ram <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. Impact is but seconds away.</p>

<p>The Deathstalker’s mate howls with pain and terror as your fatal blow pierces her evil heart. She stumbles backwards, slashing at her own chest with her razor-sharp claws in a frenzied madness of anger and frustration. Then, with a final gurgling cry, death claims her and she crashes down into the dense foliage and is still. Slowly the noises of the jungle return as the nocturnal animals of this Old Kingdom sense that the terrible threat of her presence has passed.</p>
<p>The sun rises over the jungle and lights this steamy, humid morning. By the growing light you dig a grave in the soft earth and lay the remains of the Deathstalker’s mate to rest here, among the ruins of this ancient settlement. Then you offer up a prayer to the God Kai for having bestowed upon you strength and courage enough to triumph over this creature of evil, before you mount your horse and set off along the jungle trail to Elzian.</p>

Through the open gates you can see the mighty bridge which spans the lower fork of the River Khorda. Beyond lie the Bavari Hills shimmering in a heat haze, and towards the horizon are the Great Masourn Mountains which appear like a jagged purple frieze joined to the sky.</p>
<p>Standing in line before the south gates is a caravan of wagons drawn by sturdy douggas, the sand horses of the Dry Main. Many wagons are piled high with merchants’ goods destined for Bavari—a rich cargo watched over by a dozen armed outriders in the pay of the caravan’s owners. You approach a line of trestle tables set up near the leading wagons where passengers may purchase a seat aboard the caravan for the three-day journey to Bavari.

They come from your fellow travellers who cannot believe that it is you, the friendly Northlander, who is to fight Dromodon the Invincible to the death.

<p>‘You must be the journeyman who’s sailing south.’ The answer comes from the top of a staircase, Moments later a broad-shouldered man with a golden beard and sharp blue eyes comes striding down the stairs. ‘I’m Raker,’ he says, as he struggles to pull on his leather jerkin and fix the belt of his heavy-bladed cutlass. ‘Hey, Squin.

<p>The sun grows warmer as noon approaches and the parched hills around Bavari melt away into a lush savannah of tall grasses, broken occasionally by swathes of loamy soil. The air has become humid and the fertile landscape is rich with fauna. In the distance, the verdant foothills of the Great Masourn Mountains appear in stark contrast to the brown arid wastes through which you have travelled these past few days.</p>
<p>As night falls you find yourself approaching a village which sits astride the border with neighbouring Dessi. It shelters behind a tall palisade which is patrolled by several Vakeros, the indigenous tribesmen of this realm. They are an ancient race whose lineage can be traced back to the Age of the Old Kingdoms, yet the Vassagonians consider them to be primitives and often pour scorn on their simple ways and their tribal culture. Some of Vassagonia’s more ruthless leaders have in the past waged war upon the Vakeros with the aim of stealing their fertile land, but all of these wars have ended in costly defeat for Vassagonia. Dessi is ruled by the Elder Magi whose mastery of Old Kingdom magic is unparalleled and, over many centuries, they have taught the secrets of their battle-sorcery to the Vakeros. Armed with magic, they have kept their land and their culture secure from the ravages of their aggressive desert neighbour.</p>
<p>Since the demise of the Darklords and the fall of Zakhan Kimah—the despised Vassagonian ruler—peace has returned to the border regions of Dessi. Yet, as you approach the palisade, you see that the Vakeros guards are wary and suspicious. One of their elders approaches you and, with a staff of twisted black wood, he signals that he wants you to halt. Your Sixth Sense detects that his staff possesses magical properties; he is using it to assess if you are a threat to his village.</p>

Reluctantly you sheathe your weapon and raise your hands in surrender for to attempt an escape now is futile.</p>
<p>The gladiators surround you swiftly and drag you out of the room. You are manhandled roughly along the tunnel and brought before a distinguished-looking man who is clad in fine white linen and jewel-encrusted armour. He is Torvax, the owner of the dead warrior-slave Malduz. The news that his finest gladiator is dead sends him into a blind fury. Malduz was to fight at dusk in the final combat of the circus. Now Torvax stands to lose the winner’s purse of 1,000 Gold Crowns. In his rage he orders that you be executed at dusk before the entire arena.

You are mindful of your need to find lodging for the night and some means by which you will be able to continue your journey to Elzian. As you stop to look at the market and the façades of the shops and taverns which border upon it, your eye is caught by the gaily-decorated merchant’s stalls and the exotic wares displayed upon them.</p>

<p>Quickly you unshoulder your Bow and snatch an Arrow from your Quiver. Bracing yourself against the ship’s rail, you draw back your bowstring and scan the decks of the attacking ship for a suitable target. Two immediately loom into view. The first is the ghastly maw of the giant spider; the second is the head of a warrior who is standing inside the forecastle. From the way he is shouting at those around him, you suspect that he must be the commander of the enemy vessel.</p>

<p>You use your Kai healing skills to revive the old man and calm his trembling limbs. Then you help him to sit up and, when he has regained his composure, he looks into your eyes and says:</p>
<p>‘You are one of the Kai, yes?’ You nod your head and a smile deepens the wrinkles around his mouth. ‘You possess a stone of power…a legendary stone?’ This time you hesitate, but you sense that it is a rhetorical question: the old man already knows the answer. Briefly he searches among his pillows and retrieves a leather-bound tube. He flips open one end of the tube and tips a plain-looking ring into the palm of his hand. It seems to be crafted from petrified wood.</p>
<p>‘Take this, Kai Lord,’ he says, and proffers you the ring. ‘It will keep you safe on your long journey. That which you seek to return <em>must</em> be delivered.’</p>
<p>You take the ring and place it in the pocket of your tunic (record Temujun’s Ring as a Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>). The old man smiles once more and, although no words are exchanged, you sense that he is deeply satisfied to be able to assist your vital mission.</p>
<p>You thank him and leave his tent. Once outside, you walk down to the edge of the oasis to bathe your face and drink the warm, fresh water.

<p>Oriah returns to her cabin to rest whilst you stay on deck and help tend the wounded crewmen. Using your Kai curing skills, you do what you can to ease their pain and repair their battle-wounds. To your great surprise, many of the injured men’s wounds heal at a remarkable speed. In fact some recover so quickly that you acquire something of a reputation among them as a miracle worker. Secretly, though, you suspect that it is the presence of the Moonstone that is the real reason for their miraculous return to good health.</p>
<p>It is shortly before dusk when Captain Raker brings his damaged ship limping into the harbour of Cape Kabar, and moors her alongside its red-stoned quay. Leaving Paoll in charge, he goes ashore to seek out his shipwright friend, Kimpil, at the harbour shipyard. Soon he returns with a wizened old man and together they inspect the damaged hull.</p>
<p>‘It’s goin’ to take a month to fix ’er right,’ says the captain on his return. ‘Kimpil says her keel’s damaged and she’ll have to go into dry-dock. It’s goin’ to be a long job.’</p>
<p>After talking with Raker and the others, you decide that you cannot stay here for a month while the ship is being repaired. Oriah, too, is anxious to leave for she fears that Cape Kabar is the first place Sesketera will look for her when he hears of his brother’s death. Oriah has friends in Bisutan whom she trusts and she suggests that you travel there together. She is confident that her friends can help you to reach Elzian quickly and safely.</p>
<p>In addition to Oriah, you also agree to take with you the three surviving marines—Ernan, Sligh, and Oswin. Ernan has visited Cape Kabar once before and he knows the route south to Bisutan. He also knows of some stables on the far side of the town where the five of you could acquire some horses. You agree that it would be worth a visit.</p>
<p>Before you bid farewell to Raker and his crew, you share one last meal with them. (Unless you possess Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.)</p>

<p>Warily the Vakeros move forward to surround you, their spears held out at arm’s length as if they are afraid to come too close. Their officer, a young lieutenant, steps a pace nearer and you can see that he is sweating profusely. It is a warm night but this is not the reason he is perspiring: he is terrified. Then he recognizes the style of your tunic, and when he looks carefully at your face you see the whipcord tension in his body begin to ease.</p>
<p>‘You’re a Kai?’</p>

You fall asleep within minutes of lying down upon the feather-mattressed bed, yet it seems as if you have barely closed your eyes when, two hours later, you are rudely awoken by noises in the taproom below. The clomp of iron-shod boots and the hubbub of angry voices make you leap from your bed and reach for your weapon. Quickly you gather your equipment and cloak and ease open the door to your room. Outside in the corridor you see your companions; like you they have been awoken by the commotion downstairs.</p>
<p>‘It’s the City Guard,’ whispers Oswin, who is peering down the stairwell. Then the tavern-keeper appears and he comes rushing up the stairs. His face is red as a beetroot and he is shaking with fright. ‘The…the Funtal of Bir Rabalou’s men are here,’ he says, his voice wavering. ‘They’ve had word that there are assassins abroad in the harbour and they’re checking all foreigners.

<p>With the old magician draped over your shoulder, you leap from the basket and plummet towards the ground. As you fall, you utter the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Levitation</i> and instantly the spell enables you to control the speed of your descent towards the trees below. You see the balloon smash into the timberland and, as you descend through the upper branches of this pine forest, you brace yourself in readiness for the moment when your feet touch the ground.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you cast <i>Levitation</i> in mid-air, you did not anticipate that the increased weight of Yranai would have any effect on your control of this spell. It is not until you are within twenty feet of the ground that you realize you are coming down too fast. You attempt to compensate but it is too late and you strike the rocky soil with a tremendous jolt that knocks you unconscious.</p>

<p>Together with Paoll and a party of five armed marines, you row ashore in the ship’s longboat. With weapons drawn, you and your search party sift through the ruins of Khadro’s encampment but find few items of any practical value. There are several tracks which have been made by the creatures you glimpsed earlier, but they all lead away into the surrounding jungle and you can no longer detect their presence.</p>
<p>Mindful of the risk you are taking simply by being here on the island, away from the ship, you signal to the men to return to the longboat. As you are descending the beach, you trip accidentally upon something half-buried in the black sand. Closer inspection reveals it to be a fist-sized ball of iron that has been crafted into the shape of a human skull.

<p>Shocked by this mental intrusion, you dig your heels into Jhani’s flanks and urge the old mare to the gallop. The elder dodges aside as your horse bolts forward and the Vakeros guards along the palisade loose off their arrows. They whistle past you on all sides yet, in the near-darkness, fail to find their mark. Keeping yourself pressed low against your horse’s neck, you steer her around the perimeter of the palisade and into a field of tall bamboo where you quickly disappear from sight.</p>
<p>It is dark when you finally rein Jhani to a halt. You dismount and tend to the hundreds of tiny cuts and abrasions she has sustained to her legs, caused by the sharp bamboo stalks. Rather than push on in the dark and have your horse sustain more injuries, you camp here for the night. Unfortunately, the bamboo fields of Dessi are notorious for their infestations of biting mosquitoes, and you spend most of the long night fending them off: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Also, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose a further 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>It is noon of the following day when eventually you emerge from the Koneshi Mountains and catch your first exciting glimpse of the great city of Bisutan, seated upon an island in the estuary of the River Khorda. With an air of expectation you follow the mountain road as it meanders down through sagebrush hills until, at dusk, you finally reach a titanic stone bridge that spans the shimmering waters of the Khorda. This mighty bridge has for centuries carried a flow of traders to and from a towering gatehouse which is set into the city’s protective wall.</p>
<p>It is not the custom of Bisutan’s city guards to stop travellers without good reason, for here the merchants of all Magnamund meet to haggle and trade and barter their cargoes. With a courteous smile they allow you to pass through their great gate and enter their magnificent city.</p>

<p>You enter the right alley and the militia, who are following closely, split into two groups. Roughly half their number searches the other alley whilst the remainder stays with you.</p>
<p>As you are running along this narrow thoroughfare, you suddenly hear the sound of splintering timbers somewhere in the distance. A hundred yards later the alley opens out into a tree-lined plaza which is bordered by shops selling rare artefacts of the Old Kingdom, and expensive works of art. Their windows and doors are securely barred and shuttered and show no signs of a forced entry. Then your eye is drawn to a grand building on the far side of the plaza: it is a temple. Its great stone door is closed, but a smaller wooden door at the side has been torn off its hinges. You magnify your vision and see that beyond the door is a flight of stone steps which ascend to a bell-tower.</p>
<p>Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs before silently you ascend the steps. You have climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on stone and a movement in the darkness above, and then a crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end-over-end towards you.</p>

The moon rises like a silver shield in the cloudless night sky and you make camp at the side of the trail, sheltered beneath a canopy of mosses and vines. The jungle is alive with the tiny noises of its nocturnal creatures. They seem to make your horse unusually nervous, until you soothe him with your Magnakai skills of Animal Control. You are tired after your long ride through this humid rainforest and soon you drift off to sleep.

Quickly you cut free a trailing rope and swing away from the rigging just in time to avoid being burnt to a cinder when it launches its burst of crackling blue fire. Your swift action saves you, but as the momentum of your swing carries you back towards the rigging, you see that the creature is preparing a new form of attack.</p>

To avoid them you are forced to flee into a maze of alleys and eventually you lose them in the town’s east quarter. Night is fast approaching and you sense that it will be completely dark within the hour. As you walk along a cobbled street towards the town’s east gate, you glance into the front windows of shops and emporia that are still open for business here despite the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>You stare across the ocean at the banks of angry clouds which are growing larger and darker with every passing minute. You sense that within them are tremendous natural forces that are building up at a dangerous rate. You feel certain that the presence of the Moonstone is partially responsible for this, although these waters are notorious for their sudden and violent sea-storms.</p>
<p>Gradually the temperature drops and the gentle undulation of the waves grows fiercer. The wind becomes a gale and the azure sky grows darker and darker, until the sun is lost from view and the ship is shrouded by a deep grey twilight. Soon lightning is the only source of illumination. It tears the roiling clouds and transforms the sea into an angry beast that lashes and batters the ship with a supernatural fury. Then the darkness is obliterated by a great curtain of white fire. Tongues of flame lance down, boiling the sea where they strike the surface and sending up great clouds of steam in their wake. Miraculously these terrifying bolts of power miss the ship, but soon they are rivalled in their ferocity by another terrifying force that is battling to free itself from this hellish storm.</p>
<p>A hundred balls of dancing fire fall from the clouds like a shower of blazing meteors. One such meteor strikes the helmsman who is struggling with the ship’s wheel, and it engulfs him. For a few dreadful moments his head and chest are contained within a roaring yellow orb; then the burning ball is caught by the wind and it spins away into the darkness. The crew scream with terror when they look upon their comrade, for his upper body has been transformed into a blackened and fleshless skull that perches precariously upon a hollow, smoking rib cage.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VIII]</div>
<p>Panic grips the Vassagonian sailors. They abandon their posts and rush to seek shelter below decks in the crowded cargo hold. You are trying to rally them when suddenly a ball of flame drops from the raging skies and comes hurtling down towards your head.</p>

Cold sea and hot flames lash at your body as you fight bravely to steer the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> towards a sliver of sunlight that glows like a beacon of hope beyond this supernatural storm.</p>
<p>After what seems like an eternity, the ship emerges from the grim darkness and sails into a calm sea that is bathed in warm sunlight. Behind you the storm abates as quickly as it arrived and, one by one, the crewmen begin to appear out of the hold. Their tanned faces are pale and they are speechless with shock, yet you can tell by the look in their eyes that they are deeply grateful to have you aboard. Kol appears, shaking and dishevelled, yet he finds the words to express how he and his men feel. He praises your skill and bravery and says that everyone aboard owes you their lives. As a small token of his gratitude he offers you his Sword, his Dagger, and a pouch containing 20 Gold Crowns.

You breakfast with the crew who, out of respect, insist that you have only the best food that is on board (you may restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.

<p>You recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i> and cast a bolt of energy at the leader. It strikes the bird’s wing and breaks the bone, causing the creature to spiral out of control. Yranai cheers but his triumphant cry is premature. You watch aghast as the Itikar collides with the balloon and stabs its talons into the canopy. In its desperation to survive, it shreds the cloth to ribbons before it falls away and plummets to its doom in the timberlands below.</p>
<p>The impact of the bird hitting the canopy knocks you off your feet. Yranai falls on top of you and, for a few nerve-racking seconds, you lie entangled at the bottom of the basket. You can feel the balloon is rapidly losing altitude. When you pull yourself up and peer over the rim of the basket you see the trees of the lower mountain slopes rising towards you at a dizzying speed. Yranai looks up to see shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy above and the sight is too much for him: he faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap away from this doomed balloon as the tops of the mountain pines come into view.</p>
<p>With the old magician draped over your shoulder, you leap from the basket and plummet towards the ground. As you fall, you utter the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Levitation</i> and instantly the spell enables you to control the speed of your descent towards the trees below. You see the balloon smash into the timberland and you brace yourself in readiness for the moment when your feet touch the ground.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you cast <i>Levitation</i> in mid-air, you did not anticipate that the increased weight of Yranai would have any effect on your control of the spell. It is not until you are within twenty feet of the ground that you realize you are coming down too fast. You attempt to compensate but it is too late and you strike the rocky soil with a tremendous jolt that knocks you unconscious.</p>

<p>You awake with the dawn feeling refreshed and eager to begin the day’s ride south towards the city of Bir Rabalou. During the morning, you and your travelling companions pass several traders and caravans that are heading north to sell their wares in Cape Kabar. Your fair complexions and Sommlending clothes draw many suspicious glances from the caravan drivers, prompting you to stop when you come to a village shortly after midday. Here the marines go looking for some <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">mhaktis</i>—the flowing grey and white robes traditionally worn by the desert dwellers of Vassagonia. While they busy themselves in the hunt for new clothes, you water and feed the horses at the village stables. You are tending to the horses when you are approached by an elderly street vendor. He is pushing a handcart on which he has displayed the following items for sale:</p>

They bundle and tie their marine uniforms to the saddle blankets of their horses, and then the four of you mount up and leave this village. The sun is sinking below the desert horizon when you come to the next village on the road to Bir Rabalou.

<p>You ride all night along the empty coast road and make good progress. Shortly after dawn you pass a stone signpost pointing to the south. Carved into its surface is the following message written in ancient Vassagonian script: ‘Bir Rabalou—160 miles’.</p>
<p>Beyond this sign the coast road ascends into an expanse of arid hill country which is populated by herds of wild goats. To the east you occasionally glimpse the ocean beyond the barren hills, while to the west you can see a range of distant mountains, their snowy peaks glistening stark-white beneath the fierce desert sun. Shortly before noon you happen upon the town of Kilij which lies in a narrow pass between two steep hillsides. Oriah and the marines are tired and sore after the long night’s ride and they urge you to stop here so that they might eat and rest awhile. Together you ride into the town’s busy market square and dismount at a stone water trough where you allow your horses to drink their fill. Around you the mood of the townspeople is friendly as they barter and trade their wares. A young boy offers to look after your horses while you visit the market. Initially you are suspicious of his motives until your Sixth Sense confirms that he is an honest lad, and one worthy of your trust. Oriah gives him a Gold Crown and his face beams with joy—he’ll be able to eat well this week!</p>
<p>The marines want to explore the market’s bazaar in the hope of finding some blankets and rope with which they can improvise saddles and reins for the horses. Oriah is intrigued by the sheer number of people who fill Kilij’s market square and she wants to find out what has drawn such a large crowd to this remote town. You too are curious and you agree to accompany her. After arranging to meet the marines at the horse trough in one hour’s time, you follow Oriah as she pushes her way through the teeming crowd.

<div class="illustration">[Illustration IX]</div>
<p>At first you are wary of permitting a stranger to join the ship. She is a very attractive young woman, and her company would certainly be appreciated during the long voyage south, but the agents of Naar have been known to adopt many guises to further their evil aims. Fernant, sensing your reticence, attempts to persuade you by explaining the predicament in which Oriah has been placed through no fault of her own.</p>
<p>You learn that Oriah is the daughter of Khazullo—the Funtal of Fio Fadali—a rich, powerful, and very ruthless man. He has pledged his daughter’s hand in marriage to Sesketera, the ruler of the city-state of Ghol-Tabras in northern Shadaki. Sesketera is a cruel and brutal suitor, and Oriah will be sure to spend the rest of her life as little more than his slave if the marriage takes place as her father has planned. Her father is deaf to her wishes; his only concern is for the political union of the two cities. His daughter’s happiness means nothing to him when compared to the riches and power he will gain from a marriage to the House of Sesketera.</p>
<p>Oriah has run away from her father’s palace in Fio Fadali and she has sought refuge in Barrakeesh. But agents in the employ of her father and Sesketera have traced her to the capital and now she must flee once more. Fernant, moved by the plight of this brave young woman, has pledged to help her reach Bisutan where trusted friends will smuggle her to safety in neighbouring Kakush.</p>
<p>Having heard her story and satisfied yourself that she poses no threat to your mission, you agree to allow her to travel with you to Bisutan aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. Oriah and Fernant thank you for your compassion, and the Lord-lieutenant suggests that perhaps it is time to retire for the night. He has his servant take Oriah to an adjoining chamber, and he offers you the use of a room upstairs. It is a very warm and humid night and you decide that perhaps it would be more comfortable if you were to sleep outside on the roof.

<p>The road becomes increasingly tortuous as it traverses the central reaches of the Koneshi Mountains. Long winding climbs around precipitous cliffs are followed by steep descents into wooded ravines which test your nerve and your horsemanship to the full. Among the trunks of the blond Vassagonian mountain pines which border this route you glimpse the feral eyes of hungry timber wolves. Their howling disturbs the horses and you are forced to use your Kai skills throughout this difficult crossing to keep all four of the steeds calm and controllable.</p>
<p>It is a little after midday when you hear the rumble of thunder echoing through the surrounding peaks. You suspect a storm must be approaching, yet the sky above is clear and your keen senses detect no winds nor any change in atmospheric pressures. Later, as the trail passes around a steep cliff-face, you see the cause of the rumbling: ahead the narrow trail is blocked by a landslide. The dust has settled and, when you magnify your vision, you think you can see a way to cross the mound of broken rocks. You tell the marines to wait for you while you go ahead to check if it is safe for you all to proceed. You are picking your way cautiously across the rockfall when suddenly a loud roar fills your ears and you look up to see a thousand tons of loose shale come tumbling down the mountainside. It is too narrow to turn your horse about and so you dig your heels into his flanks and urge him forwards. To your horror, he panics and rears up on his hind legs in an attempt to throw you off his back.</p>

<p>Over a delicious supper of fish roe and steamed vegetables (restore 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), you learn that the old man’s name is Yranai and that he is a native of Hikas. He was on his way home from Bisutan aboard his flying craft when it developed a mechanical problem, and he was forced to make an unscheduled landing in the hills just a few miles to the south of this town. He is staying overnight at the tavern while the blacksmith repairs the convexor, the device that accidentally snagged your cloak. When you tell Yranai that you are bound for Elzian, he offers to transport you there aboard <cite>Simoom</cite>—his flying craft. To travel the last leg of your journey to Elzian by air would save you many days, especially as you have yet to cross the Great Masourn Mountain Range. Gladly you accept Yranai’s offer, and you agree to meet him in the taproom at dawn so that he can take you to the place in the hills where his craft <cite>Simoom</cite> is grounded.</p>

<p>Beyond its encircling wall the deserted streets of Khor lend it the aspect of a ghost town. You magnify your vision and you are able to count more than a hundred freshly-dug graves within fifty paces of the town gates. The gates themselves hang open and unguarded, and when you pass through them, the hooves of your horses make a hollow echo along the empty streets beyond. You hear a distant bell tolling and you follow the sound to a mount which overlooks the town harbour. Here you see some of the inhabitants for the first time and you are shocked by how pale and gaunt they all appear.</p>
<p>A funeral is in progress and the bereaved are walking in line behind a hearse which bears a casket draped with black silk. The procession halts when it reaches the top of the mount and then the casket is quickly interred and sealed inside a marble tomb. A dignified-looking man addresses the mourners. He praises the qualities of the man they have laid to rest and then, in his official capacity as the Mayor of Khor, he declares that a state of quarantine will exist in the town from midnight onwards.</p>
<p>‘This quarantine will be strictly enforced,’ he says with a stern voice, ‘until the scourge of Bita Fever has been eradicated from our midst!’</p>

<p>Consciousness returns through a kaleidoscopic swirl of colour and pain (lose 8 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). Bruised and aching, you pull yourself into a sitting position and see the wreckage of the balloon hanging among the trees and scattered across the rocks nearby. A few feet away lies Yranai; he is still unconscious and you see at once that his left leg is badly broken. Gingerly you pull yourself over to his side and you are about to examine his injured leg when you hear voices calling you from among the trees. Three Vakeros natives appear from out of the pines and come hurrying over the rocks towards you. You examine the old magician and discover that he has stopped breathing: he is near to death. It is only through the use of your Kai curing skills that you are able to make him breathe again and bring him back from the edge of the abyss. You set his fractured leg but, despite your best efforts, you cannot return him to consciousness.</p>
<p>The three Vakeros tell you that they know Yranai and they offer to take care of him. They construct a makeshift stretcher from their coats and carry him to their settlement which is less than a mile distant. You stay here this night and use your healing skills to save the old man’s leg before you eventually settle down to a few hours’ sleep. At dawn you awake to find him still unconscious. You are anxious to continue your journey, and yet you feel compelled to help Yranai regain his health. You talk with the Vakeros and tell them that you must leave and they assure you that Yranai is safe with them. They promise to take good care of him. They also offer to give you one of their sturdy mountain horses, an old mare called Jhani, to help speed your journey southwards. Gratefully you accept their generous offer and then you bid them farewell before you leave their settlement by way of a mountain track.</p>
<p>It is around noon of the following day when the track finally emerges from the foothills of the Great Masourn Mountains and joins the coast road some 30 miles from Hikas. In the distance you see a village and you ride towards it.

You relay these details to Fernant, and Oriah gasps with fright.</p>
<p>‘It’s the symbol of Ghol-Tabras,’ Fernant says, ‘the city-state ruled by Sesketera.’ The merest mention of her evil suitor’s name is enough to make Oriah faint with shock.

<p>You wake early and take time to clean your Weapons and equipment before going downstairs to the taproom at dawn to meet with Yranai. Together you leave the tavern and pass through the town’s east gate as a bell in a nearby tower clangs five times. For a mile you walk along the caravan route to Hikas until you come to a place where a fallen toa tree lies across a ditch beside the road. Yranai stops here and points to a gentle hill little more than half a mile distant. ‘I’m sure she’s behind that hummock,’ he muses, and he sets off with you following patiently behind.</p>
<p>As you reach the top of the hill you see his flying craft resting in a gully below. It is a huge balloon which is attached by steel cables to a basket that lies on its side. A tangle of metal pipes and brass cylinders hangs suspended in a cradle under the balloon, and several parts of this strange engine are dented and scraped, indicating that Yranai must have had a bumpy landing. On reaching the balloon, you struggle to set the basket upright while Yranai fits the repaired convexor. Minutes later, he turns a valve and the engine splutters into life. After a few bangs and wheezes it settles into a chugging rhythm, and you both scramble to climb aboard as the balloon rises and hoists the basket off the ground.</p>

<p>Young city children wave and cheer as the caravan trundles out of Bisutan. Soon you cross the great southern bridge, and when you look down at the sparkling blue waters of the Khorda, you see there a flotilla of tiny fishing craft plying their trade. For the first hour of the journey you content yourself with the view and watch the lush scenery and picturesque villages of the river basin pass before your eyes. However, when the caravan enters the Bavari Hills this pleasant landscape soon gives way to a more mundane vista—a seemingly endless sea of barren mounds and arid rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>After a while your attention turns to the other passengers. They are a cheerful group of Vassagonians who are returning to their homes in Bavari after family visits and business in Bisutan. You pass the time exchanging stories and playing cards. You learn that this caravan is regularly used by the merchants of Bavari and Hikas. They prefer to transport their wares by road rather than risk the sea voyage through the Bay of Sharks. Contrary to its name, you hear that there are no longer any sharks in this bay; they migrated to southern waters many centuries ago. One of the passengers jokingly suggests that the reason they left was because of the pirates. The bay is a notorious haunt of buccaneer fleets and renegade privateers.</p>
<p>The surrounding country may be bleak and barren to the eye, but the road is good and the territory is safe. The merchants have established armed outposts every 20 miles which help to deter bandits from raiding the caravans <i xml:lang="fr">en route</i>. The first night is spent at an outpost and the second night a camp is struck at an oasis where the road is joined by a track. This neglected track traverses the mountains and leads to the Great Masourn Trail, an ancient trade route. Many of your fellow travellers have been looking forward to arriving at the oasis, for it allows them the chance to visit Temujun the Sage—the famous soothsayer of the Dry Main, and when the caravan arrives there, they hurriedly disembark. You watch with fascination as half of your wagon’s passengers scurry towards Temujun’s tent, which is pitched at the edge of a shimmering pool, whilst the other half gather about a blazing campfire and share their food while they enjoy a performance given by a troupe of actors.</p>

<p>It is dark when you finally bid farewell to Captain Raker and the crew of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. Ernan leads your party through the warm, lantern-lit streets of this fragrant coastal town and soon you arrive at the Barczak Stables. This grand establishment comprises a large single-storey building with arched windows and a clay-tiled roof, surrounded by numerous orchards, paddocks, and porticoes. The estate is shrouded in darkness and appears to be deserted, although your keen Kai senses detect that there are people asleep somewhere inside the main building.</p>
<p>Next to the main gate stands a wooden notice board displaying a dozen sun-yellowed parchments. A closer inspection reveals them to be a handwritten roster of all the horses that are for sale. You cannot help but notice just how expensive they are. If the five of you were all to pool every Gold Crown you possess, you would still not have enough to buy even the cheapest horse on this list.</p>
<p>In a paddock behind the main building you can see a dozen horses quietly enjoying the warm night air. Sligh points out that there is nobody around and he suggests that it would be easy for you to help yourselves to five of these fine steeds.</p>
<p>‘I’m not a horse thief,’ you retort, ‘and I’ve no wish to rob these stables.’</p>
<p>‘I respect your honesty, my lord,’ says Sligh, ‘but surely you don’t want to have to walk all the way to Bisutan? I’m not saying we steal five horses, I’m saying we just borrow them for a while. We can hire a rider to bring them back just as soon as we reach Bisutan.’</p>
<p>You are not entirely convinced that Sligh is sincere, yet you agree reluctantly to go along with his plan.</p>

It is a laborious process and in return for your efforts you discover 9 Gold Crowns and a Dagger. (If you wish to keep these items, adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>

<p>For two days you travel this road as it crosses the lush coastal plain of northeastern Dessi, which nestles in the rain shadow of the Great Masourn Mountains. The land is bountiful and neither you nor your trusty horse go hungry for want of fresh food. By noon of the third day you come to a village 30 miles from the city of Hikas.

<p>The road from Hikas to Gologo is an ancient trail which crosses rich plantations of tropical crops that are cultivated by the Vakeros, and then meanders through wild expanses of jungle that have for centuries defied all attempts at cultivation. As you ride this lush road, you are reminded of your history lessons at the Kai Monastery and you recall some of the things you were taught about this ancient realm.</p>
<p>Dessi is ruled by the Elder Magi who are all that remain of a race of great magicians who once ruled central Magnamund thousands of years ago. They were the first practitioners of magic upon this world, and they were wise and powerful leaders until their numbers were decimated by a Great Plague that was released by their enemies—the Cener Druids of Ruel. Those who survived sought refuge here in fertile Dessi and have lived here ever since.</p>

<p>Your horses lose speed as they labour the last few hundred yards to the top of the ridge. Anxiously you glance over your shoulder and see that the glow of your pursuers’ torches is getting brighter as relentlessly they close the distance between you. Upon reaching the top of the ridge you are relieved to see that the coast road now begins a long and gentle descent through the hills, but when you coax your tired steed to greater effort it fails to respond. The others, too, are unable to make their horses run any faster.</p>
<p>Knowing that you cannot hope to outrun your pursuers, you scour the hills for a place to hide. Your night vision reveals a deep gully running parallel to the road and you signal your companions to follow as you urge your exhausted horse to enter it. Here you dismount and wait until those who are chasing you have ridden past. When their torches can no longer be seen in the distance you remount and begin to retrace your tracks out of the gully. You are within a few dozen yards of the road when something startles your horse and he rears up on his hind legs, throwing you heavily to the ground (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>You are getting to your feet when you feel a sharp pain shoot up the back of your leg: you have been bitten by a snake. Oswin unsheathes his sword and leans from his horse to take a swipe at the ground. His blow severs the snake’s head from its body and it falls close by. To your dismay you see that it is a Jubai—the most poisonous of Vassagonia’s desert serpents. Your natural Kai curing skills act swiftly to counter the toxin that has entered your blood, but Jubai venom is very potent and you have received a massive dose.</p>

<p>You are horrified to see that the attacking ship has a large cannon mounted on its prow. Moments after the pirates fire their gun, you hear the whistle of a heavy cannonball as it hurtles towards the deck of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. It rips through the gunwale close to where you are standing and you are knocked over by the blast (lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). As you drag yourself to your feet, you discover that your Backpack has saved you from sustaining a more serious injury. (Two of the items that you are carrying have been destroyed by the blast. You must now erase two items of your choice from your Backpack Items list.)</p>
<p>As the smoke clears you see that the rest of the crew have escaped injury, and damage to the ship is minimal. You hear Sergeant Dryan command his men to return fire and a volley of shots from the three swivel guns slams into the bow of the pirate ship with devastating effect. Two shots penetrate below the waterline and the third severs the bowsprit. As it falls into the ocean, it rips away sail and rigging which drag more than a dozen pirates overboard. In disarray, the enemy vessel veers from its collision course and founders in the wake of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> as it enters the Bukimi Channel. Here your ship picks up a prevailing wind which propels it away from the second pirate raider. Soon both ships have disappeared and, when Raker is sure that the danger has passed, he warmly praises both the marines and his crew for the skill and courage they have displayed.</p>
<p>Later, as the ship navigates the narrow strait dividing the two Lakuri islands, you pass within a few hundred yards of the fire-blackened ruins of a beach settlement which nestles in a bay, overshadowed on three sides by cliffs. This is Kita Cove, formerly a secret base from where Captain Khadro launched his pirate fleet.

<p>It is an Itikar, a huge Vassagonian eagle, and seated astride its feathered neck is a warrior who has taken Oriah captive during your fight with the slaver’s henchmen. Desperately you race after the great bird as it carries her away over the rooftops of Kilij, yet as you sprint across the square you see a dozen armed men emerge from the watching crowd to block your path.

<p>Yranai keeps an equal distance between the two mountains as his craft approaches the gap. But as it drifts nearer, you feel the air temperature beginning to fall rapidly as you get closer to the snowy peaks. Suddenly the basket is buffeted by rising air currents and you have to grip the handrail tightly with both hands to stay on your feet.</p>
<p>Your Magnakai tracking skills warn you that the balloon is in the grip of thermal air currents that are swirling between the peaks. These are being created by the coming together of dry air masses from the Bavari Hills and humid jungle air from the Dessian uplands. You warn Yranai but he seems unconcerned. ‘It may get a little rough,’ he says, as he struggles to keep his spectacles from being shaken off his nose, ‘but <cite>Simoom</cite> is built to take it. She’ll see us through!’</p>
<p>As if in defiance of his words, the basket lurches violently as the balloon is hit by a strong crosswind. Yranai is unable to reach the engine valves to compensate for this sudden change of direction and, to your mounting horror, you see the basket drifting towards a jagged outcrop of rock.</p>

<p>Svolta screams as your killing blow pierces his chest. He drops his sword, staggers drunkenly backwards, and then falls off the edge of the slave platform to land in an undignified heap on the dusty ground. His master—the slaver—has disappeared into the crowd, but by using your Sixth Sense and tracking skills you discover that he has slipped away to hide in the adjoining bazaar.</p>
<p>You leap from the platform and set off across the square towards the market bazaar. The slaver’s henchmen, fearing that you may escape, immediately move in from all sides to block your path. The crowd scream and scatter as you approach them for they are terrified at the prospect of being dragged into a bloody mêlée when the slaver’s thugs catch up with you. Then suddenly, in the midst of this chaotic tangle of running and screaming people, appear Ernan, Sligh, and Oswin mounted upon their steeds, and yours and Oriah’s horses in tow. News of what has happened here at the slave market has spread like wildfire through the rest of Kilij. On hearing these reports, the marines have rushed here as quickly as they could.</p>
<p>‘Come, Grand Master!’ shouts Oswin, and he throws you the rope that is now attached to your steed’s head. ‘We must flee this town at once!’</p>
<p>You leap onto the blanket-saddle which is tied to your horse’s back, take hold of the rope reins in both hands, and dig your heels into his flanks to urge him to the gallop. Two of the slaver’s henchmen rush to block your escape but they are trampled into the dirt when your horse bolts away. You race towards a tree-lined avenue on the south side of the square with your three companions galloping close behind. As you enter this thoroughfare, you see one of the slaver’s men come rushing out of a doorway. He is armed with a bow, and as you gallop past him, he draws an arrow to his lips and takes careful aim at your head.</p>

Exhausted after your ordeal at the gladiatorial arena, you unshoulder your Backpack and collapse on the bed without bothering to undress. Yet, despite your fatigue, you cannot seem to fall asleep. For more than an hour you lie staring at the cobwebbed beams of the ceiling as, in your mind’s eye, you recall some of the dramatic events of your journey so far. You picture Oriah being carried away by the Itikar, the deaths of Fernant and Sergeant Dryan aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>, and the faces of the three marines who travelled with you from Cape Kabar.

<p>The balloon lurches away from the mountainside, yet the effect of your heroic effort is dramatically short-lived. The crosswind proves to be stronger than your Kai Mastery. Cursing your ill fortune, you brace yourself against the inside of the basket as the outcrop looms nearer. Moments later, there is the sound of ripping cloth and you are jolted off your feet. Yranai falls on top of you and you lie entangled together at the bottom of the basket. Then the balloon is suddenly whisked away from the outcrop by a second crosswind.</p>
<p>You disentangle yourself from the old man and struggle to your feet. You can feel the balloon is rapidly losing altitude and, when you peer over the rim of the basket, you see the trees of the lower mountain slopes rising towards you at a dizzying speed. Yranai pulls himself up beside you, but when he sees shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy above, he faints and collapses. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap away from this doomed balloon as the top of the mountain pines come clearly into view.</p>

<p>You take a single Gold Crown from your money pouch and toss it to the old man who catches it with surprising dexterity (erase 1 Gold Crown from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>). He tests its worth by biting down on its edge with his blackened teeth before tucking it safely away in the folds of his tattered <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">mhaktis</i>.</p>
<p>‘There’s a mutiny taking place in the city of Bir Rabalou,’ he says, his creaky old voice barely audible above the crash of the surf. ‘The Funtal of the city has imposed heavy taxes on the city’s merchants, and we’ve heard from travellers that the Trader’s Guild have paid foreign assassins to come and do away with ’im.’ Suddenly the old man’s face drops and his myopic eyes narrow with suspicion when he notices that you and your companions are not natives of this land.</p>
<p>‘Don’t be alarmed,’ says Oswin, ‘we’re not assassins. We’re…traders.’</p>
<p>He smiles uneasily. Clearly he is not convinced and, without saying another word, he turns around and hobbles away across the beach.</p>
<p>‘Silly old fool!’ says Sligh. ‘We’re wastin’ our time ’ere, Grand Master. Let’s be getting on.’</p>
<p>You nod in agreement and signal to the others to follow as you turn your horse back towards the coast road. It is a clear night and the brilliant moon is nearly full. With luck you could be in Bir Rabalou well before midnight.</p>

The leader of this predatory group has golden markings on his wing tips that glint in the sun, giving them a metallic appearance, and when he sees the balloon approaching he veers away from the column. The others follow his lead and all six come flying towards you in a wedge-shaped formation.</p>
<p>They fly past overhead and stare down at the balloon with their cold black eyes. Then the leader turns about and you sense that he intends to attack you on his next pass. His companions form up behind him in a line and he leads them in a steep dive.</p>

Blood pounds at your temples and your vision blurs as he lifts you bodily from the floor. To break his grip you slam your boot into his stomach and he doubles up, releasing you as he falls gasping to his knees.</p>
<p>You stagger backwards and grab the fountain for support as gingerly you clasp your bruised throat. With croaking voice you demand the warrior explain the reason for his unprovoked attack. He answers you with a growl; then he draws his sword and strikes out at your legs. You leap over his scything blade and kick out in mid-air to catch him squarely between the eyes with the hardened toe of your boot. The warrior is flung backwards and you hear a loud <i>Crack!</i> as his head strikes the tiled floor.</p>

<p>You ride the moonlit coast road, covering the remaining 25 miles to Bir Rabalou in little more than three hours. Your first glimpse of the great trading port comes when the road crests a ridge of hills within a mile of its perimeter wall. From here you can see that the city is built in a semicircle between two great jutting spurs of land which protrude into the ocean like the horns of a huge bull. Within the city wall are hundreds of lavish buildings, yet the grandest of all is a castle which stands upon a steep hill at its centre. This one towering stronghold dominates all the other splendid structures of this rich metropolis.</p>
<p>Your arrival at the north gate at such a late hour is greeted with suspicion from a pair of surly guards. Eventually you are allowed to enter, but only after Oswin bribes them with the horse that Oriah once rode. Beyond the gate you ride along a torchlit avenue which leads down to the harbour; this is filled with trading ships of all nationalities. The quayside and its taverns are alive with activity as the captains and crews of these vessels drink themselves senseless with the money their cargoes have earned.</p>
<p>You select one of the quieter taverns and stable your horses at the rear before making your entrance. The tavern’s taproom is crowded with sailors and traders, most of whom are listening to an uncommonly fine musical performance being given by three Cloeasian minstrels. Your companions are hungry and tired and so you make your way to the counter and ask the tavern-keeper his price for food and a night’s lodging. He tells you that 10 Gold Crowns will fill all your bellies and buy you each the use of a comfortable room. You agree to his price (deduct 10 Gold Crowns from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) and he hands each of you a numbered key. The marines are not impressed with the minstrels’ classical recital and they decide to eat their meals in their rooms. Before they retire for the night you arrange to meet with them here in the taproom, first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>You seat yourself at the counter and listen to the recital as you enjoy a meal of grilled meat and sugared desert fruits. As you wipe your mouth and push away your empty plate, your eye is caught by a rotund little man who is seated alone in an alcove. ‘Ho, journeyman!’ he calls, beckoning you with a plump hand that is laden with gold and ruby rings. ‘Please, will you join me at my table?’</p>

Their windows and doors are securely barred and shuttered and show no signs of a forced entry. Then your eye is drawn to a grand building on the far side of the plaza: it is a temple. Its great stone door is closed, but a smaller wooden door at the side has been torn off its hinges. You magnify your vision and see that beyond the door is a flight of stone steps which ascend to a bell-tower.</p>
<p>Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs before silently you move up the steps. You have climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on stone and a movement in the darkness above, and then a crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end-over-end towards you.</p>

<p>Dressed in the plain green tunic, breeches, and cloak of a Kai journeyman, you return to the Vault of the Sun at midnight as ordered. Lone Wolf approves of your appearance and commends you for your determination to succeed. He is confident he has chosen the right Grand Master to fulfil this vital mission. He opens a concealed portal in the wall of the chamber and he motions you to follow him as he steps through into a torchlit tunnel. This secret passage passes under the walls of the monastery and emerges at a clearing in the surrounding Fryelund Forest. Here awaits a party of men and horses—élite troopers from King Ulnar’s Court Cavalry Regiment. Lone Wolf bids you good luck and godspeed as you climb into the saddle of a chestnut mare and, with a proud salute, you bid farewell to your leader before galloping away with the horsemen along a moonlit forest track.</p>
<p>Your bodyguard of King’s troopers have orders to ensure that you reach Holmgard harbour swiftly and safely; they know nothing about your mission. You ride all night and enter the capital shortly after dawn, whereupon you are escorted through the awakening streets to the harbour where <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>, an armed caravel, is moored alongside the stone quay. From its mainmast flies a red flag emblazoned with a golden galleon and a five-pointed crown. It is the Holmgard ensign, the flag of this city’s trading fleet. As you rein your mare to a halt, you cast your eyes along the ship’s deck and note that it is equipped with several light swivel cannon mounted upon the gunwales. It is uncommon for traders to be armed, even those that venture regularly into the Kuri Sea which is notorious for its brigands and pirate raiders. Your voyage is destined to traverse these perilous waters and so the unexpected sight of the ship’s guns comes as a welcome surprise.</p>

He says that the ship’s master, Captain Raker, is still ashore after having spent last night celebrating at the Good Cheer Inn. He says he was due back at dawn, yet he does not appear to be particularly concerned by his absence.

<p>A wave of nausea and dizziness washes over you, making you relinquish your grip on the rope reins. You fight against the mounting pain to stay conscious but this is one battle you do not win.

<p>You regain consciousness almost immediately and manage to drag yourself into a kneeling position. The marines race past on their horses, but they have seen you fall and they rein their steeds to a halt just as quickly as they are able. Gritting your teeth against the expected pain, you jerk the arrow from your side and hurl it away.

Incensed by the sight of this cowardly attack, you leap from your horse and rush towards the steps with your weapon drawn. As you begin to climb the stairs, to your surprise you see the two louts and the woman cease their struggle.

<p>You think back to the months that you spent studying the Discipline of Deliverance at the Kai Monastery, and you try to recall what you can about the illness known as Bita Fever.</p>
<p>It is a highly contagious airborne disease that originated in the Bita Swamp of Dessi. In humans it is usually only fatal in the very young or the old; healthy adults rarely die from it, although the symptoms in those affected are uncomfortable and unsightly. Victims suffer from a corpse-like pallor and can sometimes develop a vivid scarlet rash that particularly affects the face, feet, and hands. Gradually a normally healthy person who contracts the disease will develop an immunity to it after fifteen to twenty days, and outbreaks of Bita Fever in towns and cities have rarely been known to last longer than a month.</p>

It is customary for the winner of the final combat of the circus to be granted one request, and you ask that you may be allowed to go free. Torvax nods in agreement. He is grieved by the loss of his warrior-slave Malduz, but he does not hold you responsible for his death.</p>
<p>Before he instructs his men to escort you to the gates of the arena and let you go free, he hands you a silk pouch containing 20 Gold Crowns. (If you had a Bow confiscated before the combat with Dromodon, this is returned to you on your way out of the arena.)</p>

<p>Gradually the temperature drops and the gentle undulation of the waves grows fiercer. The wind becomes a gale and the azure sky grows darker and darker until the sun is lost from view and the ship is shrouded by a deep grey twilight. Now Kol realizes that he should have heeded your advice and he commands his anxious crew to run for the coast in the hope of finding a safe haven. Soon lightning is the only source of illumination. It tears the roiling clouds and transforms the sea into an angry beast that lashes and batters the ship with a supernatural fury. Then the darkness is obliterated by a great curtain of white fire. Tongues of flame lance down; they boil the sea where they strike the surface and send up great clouds of steam in their wake. Miraculously these terrifying bolts of power miss the ship, but soon they are rivalled in their ferocity by another terrifying force that is battling to escape from the hellish skies.</p>
<p>A hundred balls of dancing fire fall from the clouds like a shower of blazing meteors. One such meteor strikes the helmsman who is struggling with the ship’s wheel, and it engulfs him. For a few dreadful moments his head and chest are contained within a roaring yellow orb; then the burning ball is caught by the wind and it spins away into the darkness. The crew scream with terror when they look upon their comrade, for his upper body has been transformed into a blackened and fleshless skull that perches precariously upon his hollow, smoking rib cage.</p>
<p>Panic grips the Vassagonian sailors. They abandon their posts and rush to seek shelter below deck in the crowded cargo hold. You are trying to rally them when suddenly a ball of flame drops from the raging skies and comes hurtling down towards your head.</p>

<p>The Vakeros at the east gate recognize your Kai tunic and offer you a guarded welcome. They warn you that a curfew is in force and tell you to be off the streets by dark. You pass through the gate and follow a long shadowy street that descends towards the wharves and taverns that line the banks of the Carcos River—a murky, silt-rich channel which divides the city in two. Mindful of the imminent curfew, you tether your horse to a rail and enter the nearest tavern in search of a room for the night. Inside the air is hot and stale. A small number of men and women of mixed nationality stand at the counter and sit at small tables.

Through the smoke which shrouds the deck below you can see Sergeant Dryan and his men fighting bravely to repel the raiders.

<p>The deck of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> becomes a hive of activity as the crew sets about getting the ship ready to sail. When the last spread of canvas has been unfurled and the cables are cast off from the quayside, you feel the deck rock gently as Paoll steers the cargo-heavy vessel towards the entrance to Holmgard harbour. At first she responds sluggishly and the First Mate curses her as he struggles with the ship’s wheel. Yet, once you pass beyond the harbour’s protective walls, a sea wind fills the sails and the ship is swiftly transformed. Within minutes of leaving harbour, <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> is speeding swiftly eastwards through the foam-flecked waters of the Holmgulf.</p>
<p>For six uneventful days you sail across the Gulf of Durenor, the passage made easy by fair weather and a strong following wind. After a night’s anchorage at Port Bax, the voyage continues along the Rymerift and into the warm, turquoise waters of the Kuri Sea. Shortly after dawn of the thirteenth day, an island looms into view on the horizon. Its white sandy beaches and rich vegetation appear innocuous, but Captain Raker informs you that it is one of the notorious Lakuri Isles. For centuries the bays and hidden coves of the Lakuris have provided a safe haven for pirates, the most infamous of whom was Captain Khadro. Six years ago this murderous buccaneer was slain by your master, Lone Wolf, yet despite his demise the Lakuri Islands still harbour renegades and pirates who have set up camp here during the past year. Captain Raker scours the horizon with his telescope, seeking a tell-tale glimpse of sail among the inlets and coves which pepper the shoreline. During his last voyage he came close to losing his ship in these waters and he is understandably wary.</p>

<p>You accompany Captain Raker as he conducts a hasty tour of his ravaged ship to assess the extent of the battle damage, and you are both shocked when you discover that half his complement of crew have been killed or badly wounded. The few who can still stand count themselves lucky to have survived. Raker sets Paoll and some of the survivors to work repairing the gaping hole in the ship’s port beam that was made by the enemy’s ram, while the remainder tend to their wounded companions and clear away the debris that lies smouldering in heaps upon the bloodstained deck. Among the enemy dead you are saddened to discover the bodies of young Sergeant Dryan and nine of his men. Only three marines have survived the battle and stoically they set about wrapping the bodies of their fallen comrades in canvas and consigning them to the waves.</p>
<p>Having done what you can to help on deck, you decide to go below and make sure that Fernant and Oriah are safe. At the foot of the steps you discover a dead raider lying sprawled across the body of another man. You turn the corpse over with the toe of your boot and gasp when you see that the man lying beneath is Lord-lieutenant Fernant. The hilt of a Shadakine dagger protrudes from his chest and a smear of blood stains his lips. He is dead. Fearing the worst, you rush along the narrow corridor and throw open the door to Oriah’s cabin. You find her huddled below her bunk, sobbing quietly. You comfort her as best you can but she is overcome with grief; Fernant died whilst protecting her and she blames herself for his death and for the calamity which has befallen <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. She tells you that the raiders came from Ghol-Tabras, the city ruled by her evil suitor. She is convinced that the reason they attacked the ship was to capture her.</p>
<p>At length you persuade Oriah to accompany you onto the rear deck for some fresh air. Here you are met by Captain Raker who informs you that the ship is listing and taking in water. The voyage to Bisutan cannot proceed until proper repairs have been carried out, and so he has set a course for the nearby port of Cape Kabar where he knows a trustworthy shipwright who can fix the damaged hull. While you talk with the captain, Oriah watches the surviving crewmen disposing of the enemy dead. You hear her gasp, and when you hurry to her side you see that she is pointing at the body of the warrior leader.</p>
<p>‘Did you know this man? Have you seen him somewhere before?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ she replies tearfully. ‘He’s Dar-Isun. He was the brother of Sesketera, the man my father wishes me to marry.’</p>

<p>The militia have orders to impose the curfew and arrest anyone caught on the streets after dark. As you march alongside the young lieutenant on your way to the city’s guardhouse, you ask him why such stern measures have been imposed, especially in Hikas which is considered to be one of the most peaceful and civilized cities of Magnamund.</p>
<p>‘The people of Hikas are living in fear of their lives,’ says the lieutenant. ‘For the past month there’s been a creature stalking our streets at night. It’s killed more than fifty poor souls, and in terrible fashion. Ripped ’em to pieces. There isn’t anyone who’s lived to tell what it looks like but everyone’s got their own ideas. Some say it’s a shape-changer that goes about at day in the guise of a man and changes into a beast at night. Others say it’s come from Gorgoron, seeking revenge on the Old Kingdom for the death of its master—Agarash the Damned. I don’t know what to think. All I know is that it walks these streets, and every night someone dies a ghastly death by its hand.’</p>
<p>Suddenly a terrible shriek echoes through the empty streets. A woman standing on the balcony of a tall building nearby leans over the parapet and calls out to the lieutenant. ‘Down by the river,’ she shouts, and she points over the rooftops to where the shriek was heard. ‘The fiend…it’s struck again!’</p>
<p>‘Quick, men!’ yells the lieutenant. ‘Follow me! If we’re swift we may catch the beast this night.’</p>

<p>Upon emerging from the Bukimi Channel, <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> is caught by a strong northeasterly wind which propels her swiftly towards the Vassagonian coast. For two days and nights she rides the scudding waves, her speedy passage more than making up for any time lost in the Lakuri Isles. Then, late on the third day, the lookout catches his first glimpse of Barrakeesh. Excitedly the crew gather on deck to stare at the golden domes and towers of the city which glimmer like orbs of burnished gold in the glow of the setting sun. In fading light, Paoll brings the ship silently into the great curve of Barrakeesh harbour and moors her at the end of a vacant quay. Few eyes notice another trade ship, but one pair takes a special interest. They belong to Lord-lieutenant Fernant, the Sommlending envoy to this rich, desert realm. When finally the ship is docked and the gangplank is lowered to the quayside, he is waiting there to greet your arrival.</p>
<p>Fernant is a tall man in his mid-forties, clean-shaven, and of slim and athletic build. His face has characteristics which are unmistakably Sommlending, yet his skin is richly tanned from the many years he has spent in this sun-drenched land. After a brief talk with Captain Raker to confirm that the ship will be ready to sail tomorrow at noon, he offers you the hospitality of his house in the city. After nearly a month at sea, you gladly welcome the chance to bathe in a proper bath and sleep in a proper bed.</p>
<p>Fernant’s house is only a short distance from the harbour. It is a large, two-storey dwelling with a flat roof and a walled garden that smells sweetly of picanda and larnuma fruit. After a luxurious bath and a feast fit for a king, Fernant tells you something about the changes which have occurred in Vassagonia since the demise of its hated ruler—Zakhan Kimah—who, during the Darklands War, allied himself and his reluctant nation to the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>‘Shoualli is the new Zakhan now,’ says Fernant, as he peels the skin from a ripe larnuma and slices it neatly in two with a pearl-handled dagger. ‘He is an honourable and intelligent man. He has brought peace back to this land through trade. Its enemies, who once swore to destroy Vassagonia, now come and barter their wares in the rich markets of Barrakeesh and Bisutan.’ Later during the evening, talk turns to the details of your mission. Fernant is unaware of its true purpose; all he knows is that he is to offer you every assistance to ensure your swift and safe passage to Elzian. When you tell him that you are not at liberty to discuss your mission fully, he nods sympathetically and vows he will refrain from ever mentioning the subject again.</p>
<p>Shortly before midnight there is a knock at the front door of Fernant’s house. He signals to one of his servants to go and answer it and you comment that it is an uncommonly late hour for someone to be paying him a visit. ‘Quite so,’ he says, ‘but this is a visitor I’ve been expecting. It’s someone I’d especially like you to meet.’</p>

<p>Swooping down out of the cloudless sky come two gigantic birds with razor-sharp beaks and talons that glint like mirrored steel. They are Itikars and seated astride their feathered backs are warriors armed with spears and shields. Frantically the slaver signals to the riders and one of them responds by hurling his weapon at your head. You dive to avoid being skewered to the ground by this deadly missile and it thuds harmlessly into the beaten earth, but as you are pulling yourself to your feet, you see the second Itikar come swooping down towards Oriah. You scream a warning yet she is frozen with fear and does not respond. The great bird sweeps past her and its rider casts a lasso which falls over her head. As the bird soars into the sky the rope tightens about her waist and she is hoisted screaming into the air. You spring to your feet and race after her as she is carried away over the rooftops of Kilij, and as you sprint across the square you see a dozen armed men emerge from the crowd to block your path. The Itikar and its precious cargo are rapidly disappearing towards the northern hills and you know in your heart that it is now too late to save Oriah. Then you hear the sound of cruel laughter echoing across the square and it brings you skidding to a halt. It is the laugh of the slaver: he can barely contain his delight at having captured such a beautiful young woman, and he is relishing the thought of watching as the remainder of his henchmen make you pay for the deaths of their comrades.</p>

As you rub your eyes and stretch your aching limbs, your fellow passengers tell you that the caravan has been on the move for more than an hour. They are eating a breakfast of bread and fruit which they generously offer to share with you.</p>
<p>It is almost noon when the stone town of Bavari looms into view. Most of its sun-bleached shops and houses are contained within a wall of uncemented stone blocks which rise to twice the height of a horse. The road approaches a heavy wooden gate, banded and studded with iron, which is flanked by circular guard towers. Perforating the walls are slits for archers and openings for larger machines of war.</p>
<p>The procession of wagons passes through the gate and comes to a halt in the middle of Bavari. As you disembark you sense an air of excitement pervading this town. You overhear the other passengers talking and you learn that today is the third day of the Bavarian gladiatorial circus—an annual event which attracts the finest warriors of Vassagonia to come here and compete with each other in armed combat. Great wealth and status are the rewards for those who triumph; disgrace and sometimes death await those who fail.</p>
<p>You are curious to see this great event and so you follow a group of passengers to Bavari’s arena where the gladiatorial circus is being staged. Entrance to the arena is free and you take a seat on one of the many stone tiers that encircle its oval-shaped fighting area. Throughout the afternoon several combats are staged between warriors on foot and on horseback. The heat of the desert sun is unrelenting, and by late afternoon you are feeling parched. During a lull in the contests, you hear the tinkling sound of running water and you decide to seek out its source. You descend to the edge of the fighting area and enter a tunnel which passes beneath the tiers of seats. Halfway along this cool tunnel is an open door set into the whitewashed wall. Through the doorway you see a bronze fountain standing in the middle of an empty room. It is richly embellished with engravings which depict ancient gladiatorial contests, and a stream of sparkling water issues upwards from a nozzle at its centre, inviting you to drink.</p>
<p>You are desperate to slake your thirst and so you enter the room and stoop over the fountain. You are swallowing the deliciously cool water when suddenly you sense someone rushing at you from behind.</p>

You are passing a junction where the cobblestoned street joins with a larger avenue, when suddenly you hear the approaching tramp of booted feet.

Then you hear a faint gurgling growl and a knot of fear tightens in your throat. Now you can detect a powerful aura of evil. You glance at the cowering cleric and your fear becomes an icy terror when you realize that <em>he</em> is the source of this evil. He continues to plead with you to save him, but then he sees the shock register on your face and he abandons his pretence.</p>
<p>The pupils of his eyes shimmer and become spheres that glow darkly amber and, in a terrifying instant, his body transforms. One moment he is a bearded holy man and, in a split-second blur, he becomes a snarling hulk of black-furred death.

<p>Skilfully you ascend the rigging and approach the giant spider from behind and below. It is busily tearing at the mast and topsail with its fanged maw, and at first it fails to notice you. When you pause for a few moments to unsheathe your weapon, suddenly the creature swivels its head and fixes you with a pair of ghastly green eyes. Chittering excitedly, it rubs its forelegs together and sparks appear, warning you that it is preparing to launch a bolt of energy. Quickly you cut free a trailing rope and swing away from the rigging just in time to avoid being burnt to a cinder when it launches its burst of crackling blue fire. Your swift reflexes save you, but as the momentum of your swing carries you back towards the rigging, you see that the creature is preparing a new form of attack.</p>
<p>It waits until you come to rest upon the criss-cross of ropes and then it ejects a stream of sickly grey fluid from a sac located below its gaping maw. This fluid hardens as it passes through the air, and is transformed into several long and sticky strands which threaten to engulf you.</p>

<p>The faces of your three companions are covered by an unsightly red rash. Each man is suffering a headache and they feel nauseous and dizzy, yet these discomforts fade after you attend to them using your Kai curing skills. However, try as you may, you cannot relieve them of the vivid rash that has erupted all over their faces, hands, and feet.</p>
<p>With dismay, the three men resign themselves to the fact that they have contracted Bita Fever. Although their lives are not at risk, the inflammation of their skin is causing them great discomfort. Their only hope of easing the persistent irritation is for them to reach Bisutan and find an apothecary who may be able to concoct a lotion to soothe their purulent skin.</p>
<p>You ride all day under a clear sky and a blazing sun and stoically the marines suffer their pain in silence. Their only relief is the protection afforded by their cool, flowing <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">mhaktis</i>. It is late in the afternoon when you catch your first sight of the great city of Bisutan, which is located upon an island in the estuary of the River Khorda. A titanic stone bridge carries the coastal road over the shimmering waters of the Khorda towards a towering gatehouse which is flanked by two massive stone dragons. It is not the custom of Bisutan’s city guards to stop travellers without good reason, for here the merchants of all Magnamund meet to haggle and trade and barter their cargoes. They allow you to pass through their great gate, but one sharp-eyed young guardsman with promotion on his mind notes the strange pallor of your companions and he demands that they halt.</p>
<p>‘Bita Fever,’ proclaims a gruff old guard sergeant, and he demands that they dismount at once. He summons five spearmen from a nearby guardhouse and when they arrive he orders that your companions be taken to a gaol on the far side of the great bridge. You protest but the sergeant is adamant that they should spend a month there in isolation until the symptoms of the fever have disappeared. He assures you that they will be treated well, but they will not be permitted any visitors during their isolation. As they are escorted back across the bridge at spear’s length, they wave you farewell and urge you to continue your journey without them. You wait until they have disappeared from view and then you wheel your horse about and enter Bisutan alone.</p>

<p>A quick scan of the shelves tells your experienced eye that there are no herbs of great value or interest here. Most of the potions on display are placebos and quack remedies.

<p>You fire your Arrow at the leader and it strikes his wing and breaks the bone, causing the creature to spiral out of control. Yranai yells and cheers but his triumphant cries are premature. You watch aghast as the Itikar collides with the balloon and stabs its talons into the canopy. In its desperation to survive, it shreds the cloth to ribbons before it falls away and plummets to its doom in the timberlands below.</p>
<p>The impact of the bird hitting the canopy knocks you off your feet. Yranai falls on top of you and, for a few nerve-racking seconds, you lie entangled at the bottom of the basket as the balloon rapidly loses altitude. When you pull yourself up and peer over the rim, you see the trees of the lower mountain slopes rising towards you at a dizzying speed. Yranai looks up to see shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy above and the sight proves too much for him: he faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap away from this doomed balloon as the tops of the mountain pines come into view.</p>

<p>You are awoken shortly after dawn by the sound of a plaintive voice echoing across the rooftops of the city. It is the cry of a Vassa Elder and he is calling the faithful of Barrakeesh to early morning prayer. You gather together your equipment and Fernant’s servant brings you a bowl and a pitcher of water so that you may refresh yourself before sharing breakfast with Oriah and the Lord-lieutenant.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Fernant oversees the loading of bags and other personal items aboard his mule-drawn carriage. Then an hour before noon the three of you leave for the quay and go aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. At first Captain Raker is unhappy about transporting Oriah, arguing that the presence of a beautiful young woman aboard his ship will distract his crew from their duties. However his objections quickly evaporate when Fernant offers to pay him 20 Gold Crowns for her passage to Bisutan.</p>
<p>The ship leaves Barrakeesh on the noon tide and makes swift progress ahead of a favourable southerly wind. But by dusk the wind has dropped, and Raker decides to spend the first night at anchor in a protected cove a few miles to the east of Chula.

Behind the counter the tavern-keeper’s wife is busy preparing breakfast for herself and her family, and she bids you a hurried good morning. Mindful of your need for transport, you ask if there are any horses for sale at the adjoining stables.</p>
<p>‘Only one,’ she replies, wiping her hands on her ale-stained apron. ‘An old mare called Jhani. She’s past her prime but she’s strong and dependable. I can let you have her for 10 Gold Crowns, and I’ll throw in a saddle. What do you say to that?’</p>
<p>You agree to her price and pay her (erase 10 Gold Crowns from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have fewer than 10 Gold Crowns, you give all of your remaining Crowns to the tavern-keeper’s wife) and she calls for her husband to bring the horse around to the front door. The chestnut mare is old but she is in fine condition and you are satisfied that you have made a wise purchase. You mount up and bid the taverners farewell before riding out of Bavari by way of its east gate. Your new mount lives up to the woman’s description of her and you cover the first ten miles of your journey along the coast road with ease.

While you enjoy this delicious meal, you listen to the marines talking about their homes and families back on Kirlu, their past tours of duty, and their fond memories of Sergeant Dryan. You sense that each man, in his own way, is grieving the loss of this brave young sergeant. Soon their jovial conversation has become tinged with melancholy and homesickness and you become a little worried by their mood of sadness. To raise their morale you ask the owner to bring them each a measure of his finest brew. Gladly he accepts your order and pours each man a flagon of strong dark ale. This proves most effective in curing their melancholy for it is so strong that it renders all three of them unconscious! With the owner’s help you carry the marines to their beds and then return to enjoy a small glass of ale in his company.</p>

<p>To your surprise you see that the attacking ship is armed with a large cannon, mounted on the prow. Moments after the pirates fire their gun, you hear the whistle of a heavy cannonball as it hurtles across the deck of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. Fortunately the pirates are poor gunners and it passes within inches of the mainmast before splashing harmlessly into the ocean. Sergeant Dryan commands his men to return fire and a volley of shots from the three swivel guns slams into the bow of the pirate ship with devastating effect. Two shots penetrate below the waterline and the third severs the bowsprit. As it falls into the ocean, it rips away sail and rigging which drag more than a dozen pirates overboard. In disarray, the enemy vessel veers from its collision course and founders in the wake of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> as it enters the Bukimi Channel. Here your ship picks up a prevailing wind which propels it away from the second pirate raider. Soon both ships have disappeared and, when Raker is sure that the danger has passed, he warmly praises both the marines and his crew for the skill and courage they have displayed.</p>

<p>Beyond this sign the coast road ascends into an expanse of arid hill country which is populated by herds of wild goats. To the east you occasionally glimpse the ocean beyond the barren hills, while to the west you can see a range of distant mountains, their snowy peaks glistening stark-white beneath the fierce desert sun. Shortly before noon you happen upon the town of Kilij which lies in a narrow pass between two steep hillsides. Oriah and the marines are tired and sore after the long night’s ride and they urge you to stop here so that they may eat and rest awhile. Together you ride into the town’s busy market square and dismount at a stone water trough where you allow your horses to drink their fill. Around you the mood of the townspeople is friendly as they barter and trade their wares. A young boy offers to look after your horses while you visit the market. Initially you are suspicious of his motives until your Sixth Sense confirms that he is an honest lad, and one worthy of your trust. Oriah gives him a Gold Crown and his face beams with joy—he’ll be able to eat well this week!</p>
<p>The marines want to explore the market’s bazaar in the hope of finding some blankets and rope with which they can improvise saddles and reins for the horses.

You too are curious and you agree to accompany her. After arranging to meet the marines at the horse trough in one hour’s time, you follow Oriah as she pushes her way through the teeming crowd.

<p>You run with the militia along the narrow twisting streets towards the south quarter of Hikas, where the town houses of wealthy merchants command expensive views of the River Carcos. Again a shriek pierces the darkness, but this time it is echoed by a terrible inhuman howl. ‘The beast!’ gasps the lieutenant, and he turns to rally his men onwards. Soon the street ahead meets a towpath which runs along the river bank, and you slow your pace so you can turn the corner. As you do so, you see a man dressed in his nightclothes leaning from the open window of a house close by. He appears to be in shock for he is sobbing and clutching fitfully at his dishevelled hair. You stop and call to him and slowly he responds. He sees you through his tears and points frantically to several small bundles lying on the towpath beside the gangplank to a barge. The lieutenant rushes past you and hurries to the first bundle. You see him drop to his knees and shake his head in disbelief, and then he turns away and retches. You magnify your vision and see, to your horror, what the bundles really are. They are the shredded remains of two men, two traders who have been dragged from their beds aboard their barge and torn limb from limb by some nameless creature of the night.</p>
<p>Desperately you scan the towpath and the buildings which stand all along the river bank. Then you see something and your heart skips a beat. In the darkness of a narrow alleyway two amber eyes glint in the moonlight. You sharpen your focus and catch the faintest glimpse of a dark shape loping away.</p>
<p>‘There!’ you shout, and you give chase, with the city militiamen and the lieutenant following after.

<p>Your refusal to pay infuriates the toll collector. He brandishes his sword at you and threatens to cut off your ears.

Their disparaging laughter wounds his pride and you sense that he is about to fly into a blind rage. Using your psychic Kai powers, you cool his anger and persuade him to put away his sword. He does so, and politely now he asks that you pay a toll of 4 Gold Crowns to cross the bridge. With a nod of your head you indicate to your companions that this is a fair price and you each hand him 1 Gold Crown apiece (deduct this 1 Gold Crown from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>; if you have no money you must erase one Backpack Item instead).</p>

Gingerly you pull yourself over to his side and you are about to examine his injured leg when you hear voices calling you from among the trees.

<p>The Vakeros villagers greet you warmly as you ride into their village. These tribal people have few material possessions yet everywhere you look you see smiling, happy, contented faces. Without asking or expecting any payment or reward, they give you food and a place to sleep this night. Your horse is watered and fed and you are treated like an honoured guest.</p>
<p>You sleep well and awake at dawn feeling relaxed and refreshed: restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. When the time comes for you to leave and continue your journey, the young unmarried women of the village give you garlands of flowers and they offer you fresh fruits which they have picked from the village’s fertile fields (there is enough for 1 Meal).</p>

<p>Having concluded your business, Rhous gets ready to leave your room. But when he reaches the door he suddenly turns around and glances down at the mattress. The strap of your satchel can just be seen.</p>
<p>‘Are you sure you have nothing else you wish to sell me?’ he asks ruefully.</p>
<p>Firmly but politely you say no and bid him goodnight. The old magician leaves and, as you close and lock your door, you hear his footfalls gradually fading as he walks off along the corridor.</p>

<p>It is dusk when at last you reach the wondrous city of Elzian. It is a magical metropolis that sparkles like a fiery crimson jewel in the last rays of the setting sun. You pass through its broad outer wall and cross the canal which encircles its tallest edifice—the Tower of Truth. As you approach a vast gatehouse, the portcullis rises and a troop of Vakeros guards rush forward to greet you. They have been keeping watch for your arrival for many days and had all but given up hope that you would appear. They escort you swiftly into the tower’s vaulted council chamber where you are received by Lord Rimoah and the illustrious members of the High Council of the Elder Magi. The grand chamber is cleared of all but the most senior council members and a gasp of reverence fills its echoing reaches when, at Lord Rimoah’s request, you open your satchel and reveal the Moonstone to their learned eyes. Rimoah requests that you recount the details of your journey here and, when you have finished, he and his kinsmen praise you warmly for the greatness of your achievement.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. You have proved your courage and resourcefulness. Lone Wolf was right to entrust the task of returning the Moonstone to you. You are a credit to your homeland and your noble order. You have completed the task set by your Supreme Master and you have triumphed in the face of great adversity.</p>
<p>However, your mission is not yet fully completed. The second and most challenging part of your journey awaits, a journey that will take you deep into the wild and lawless reaches of Southern Magnamund where no Kai has ever ventured before. If you truly possess the courage to return the Moonstone to the Isle of Lorn, then your quest continues in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure entitled:</p>

<h2><a name="crsumary">Combat Rules Summary</a></h2>


<ol>
<li>Add your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to any bonus points given to you by your Kai Weapon, Special Items, or Grand Master Disciplines.</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. This number = Combat Ratio.</li>
<li>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio along the top of the chart and cross-reference to the random number you have picked. (E indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Enemy. GM indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to yourself.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from Stage 3 until one character is dead. This is when the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either character falls to 0 or below.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="smevazn">To Evade Combat</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>You may only do this when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>You undertake one round of combat in the usual way. All points lost by the enemy are ignored; only you lose the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>If the book offers the chance of taking evasive action in place of combat, it can be taken in the first or any subsequent round (unless specifically stated otherwise).</li>

<h4><a name="lic-2-1">2.1</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document. Indeed, you have no right to receive or view a copy or copies without first accepting this License as legally valid and binding and agreeing to the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>
<p>Redistribution includes but is not limited to displaying the Internet Editions within the graphical representation of an Internet site other than the Distribution Point. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the use of HTML ‘frames’.</p>
<p>An exception to the restrictions on redistribution in this section is made in that you may send the Internet Editions or derivative works thereof to the Distribution Point by the consent of the Maintainer.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-4">2.3</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators retain all other rights to their respective portions of the Internet Editions not covered by this License.

<h4><a name="lic-2-5">2.4</a></h4>

<p>If a person is under the legal age to be able to enter into a contractual relationship as defined by the laws of the area in which that person resides, they may have a parent or legal guardian agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License.

That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

<h3><a name="lic-4">4. Jurisdiction</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-4-0">4.0</a></h4>

<p>If, in consequence of court judgement or the laws of a particular area, any portion of the License is held as invalid or unenforceable in any particular circumstance, you are no longer granted any rights under the terms of this License in that circumstance. You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-5">5. Revision of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-5-0">5.0</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and the Illustrators may publish revisions of this License in the future to address new concerns. Any further revisions will be legally binding at the time that you receive notification in any form of the revision.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
