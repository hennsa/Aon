 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>The legendary Moonstone was created by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund heralded the dawn of Humanity. It contains the might of all the Shianti’s magic and wisdom—the sum of their divine knowledge. Lone Wolf, Supreme Master of the Kai, has successfully retrieved the Moonstone following its theft by the forces of darkness, and now this magical artefact must be returned quickly to its creators before its immense powers disrupt the delicate balance of nature. He has entrusted the precious Moonstone to you—the most promising warrior in the ranks of the New Order Kai.</p>

   <p>In <strong><cite>The Buccaneers of Shadaki</cite></strong>, your quest is to deliver this stone of power to the Shianti who are exiled upon the mystical Isle of Lorn. Will your vital quest succeed, or will you fall foul of the pirates and perils that infest the southern seas of Magnamund?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are a Kai Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai—the warrior élite of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>It is the year MS 5083 and thirty-three years have passed since the First Order of the Kai was almost wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. The leader of your illustrious fighting order—Lone Wolf—was the sole survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS 5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>
<p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>
<p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS 5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>
<p>In the year MS 5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf’s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it) the Dark God Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste of all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King’s Army of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>The defeat of his minions enraged Naar and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years later he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called ‘Wolf’s Bane’ who was the very image of Lone Wolf. While your leader was engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland in his guise and sought to destroy the reputation and the honour of the Kai. He would have succeeded had not Lone Wolf returned home and pursued this enemy to an ancient necropolis in the Sommlending city of Tyso. There, deep within a subterranean crypt, he and his evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness—Naar’s stronghold—where a deadly duel ensued. Lone Wolf vanquished the foe and discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti. This wondrous artefact was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund has since been measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone’s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the mysterious Isle of Lorn in Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of Lone Wolf’s eyes had told him that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of Naar.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf realized that the Dark God had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world while the force of the Gods of Good, Kai and Ishir, had been held at bay. Lone Wolf and the New Order Kai were all that stood against the onslaught of Naar’s agents following the demise of the Darklords.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf successfully escaped from the Plane of Darkness and returned to Sommerlund, yet he knew that the fight against Evil had not been won outright. He realised that he would have to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from an invasion by Naar’s legions of darkness. Two years ago, with the aid of his most trusted ally, Lord Rimoah of Dessi, Lone Wolf fulfilled his vow by journeying to the Dark God’s domain and retrieving the Moonstone of the Shianti. Upon his triumphant return, Lone Wolf placed the Moonstone in the Vault of the Sun—his personal chamber located deep below the fortified citadel of the Kai Monastery. He had hoped that the fabled artefact could remain there indefinitely, to be guarded by generations of Kai who would keep it secure from Naar’s minions. Retrieval of the Moonstone had denied the Dark God’s champions ready access to Magnamund, yet Lone Wolf knew that there were many lesser agents of Naar upon Magnamund waiting quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding. Undoubtedly they would stop at nothing to retrieve the Moonstone for their fell master.</p>
<p>Within a year of his return home it became clear to Lone Wolf that his wish could not be fulfilled. At first the presence of the Moonstone seemed greatly beneficial to Sommerlund. Crops grew abundantly, incidence of disease and illness became increasingly rare, and the newly-born were uniformly healthy. Even the offspring of the impoverished who, in normal times, could expect only one in three of their infants to survive longer than a month beyond birth, were all in good health and exceptional in their physical and mental development. The Sommlending called this extraordinary period of providence the ‘Blessing of the Moonstone’, yet this time of good fortune could not last. The power of the Moonstone is a great force for Good, but it is also greatly disruptive of the natural order of Magnamund. Soon death itself became a rarity in Sommerlund, and the four seasons of the year were slowly transformed into one unending spring. Lone Wolf was deeply concerned at the changes wrought by the Moonstone and sought the counsel of his closest friend—Guildmaster Banedon, leader of Sommerlund’s Brotherhood of Magicians. Banedon entreated him to relinquish the Moonstone before the effects of its power became irreversible. To right the imbalance of nature the Moonstone would have to be taken to the Isle of Lorn, in the southernmost reaches of Magnamund, and delivered back into the hands of the Shianti. Only they, its creators, could prevent its powers from disrupting the natural order of your world.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf agreed with Banedon—the Moonstone would have to be returned to the Shianti. The physical effects of its presence were beginning to attract the unwelcome attentions of those who secretly desire to enact Naar’s revenge upon the Kai. When one of Naar’s agents was captured by a Kai patrol within a few miles of the monastery, Lone Wolf felt he could wait no longer. He resolved to act immediately. Preparations were made for a long journey and, especially among the lower ranks of the Kai, rumours were rife that your leader would personally take responsibility for returning the Moonstone to the Shianti. Indeed, this speculation seemed to be confirmed as fact when it was discovered that Lone Wolf had secured the use of Guildmaster Banedon’s famous flying ship—<cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>.</p>
<p>It therefore came as a shock when, early one morning, you were summoned unexpectedly to the Vault of the Sun. In strictest confidence, Supreme Master Lone Wolf informed you that he had decided to entrust you with the task of returning the Moonstone to the Shianti. His elaborate preparations were simply a diversion, a bluff designed to draw attention away from the vital mission that he wished you—the most talented and courageous of his five Kai Grand Masters—to undertake. It was with great pride and apprehension that you accepted the quest.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf gave you the precious Moonstone in a seemingly ordinary satchel, yet the lining of this plain leather bag was woven from korlinium, a special mineral that would hide the Moonstone’s powerful energies from the agents of Naar. In the guise of a Kai journeyman, you set sail from the Sommlending capital of Holmgard aboard a caravel that was to carry you south on the first leg of your journey, a voyage of 2,000 miles to Elzian, the capital of Dessi. This legendary city is home to Lord Rimoah and the Elder Magi. They are the last surviving members of Magnamund’s oldest race of magicians and they had promised Lone Wolf that they would help you reach your final destination. You had hoped and expected the voyage would be swift and uneventful; however fate and ill fortune decreed otherwise. Your ship was attacked by pirates off the coast of Vassagonia and badly damaged. It limped to the port of Cape Kabar where you were forced to continue the long journey by overland routes to Elzian. This trek was fraught with danger, yet you overcame the many perils ranged against you and eventually arrived at the Dessian capital, to the relief of Lord Rimoah and his anxious brother magicians who had feared the worst.</p>
<p>Now the final and most challenging part of your voyage to the Isle of Lorn lies ahead. And it is a journey that may prove more difficult than any you have undertaken so far, for it will lead you deep into the wild and lawless reaches of Southern Magnamund.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>) and physical stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 32). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed the previous adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Book 21), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to this adventure. You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have completed the previous <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add +1 to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and +2 to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>
<h3><a name="kainame">Your Kai Name</a></h3>

<p>It has long been the tradition of your élite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year’s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
<p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

<h4><a name="nodispln">New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines</a></h4>

<p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor—Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf—you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>
<p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which you begin the <cite>New Order</cite> series, means that you are skilled in the use of <em>one</em> of the weapons listed below.</p>
<p>For every adventure that you complete successfully in the <cite>New Order</cite> series while possessing the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery, you will gain proficiency with one additional weapon.</p>
<p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 points to any number you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.</p>
<h5><a name="anmlmstr">Animal Mastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.</p>
<h5><a name="deliver">Deliverance <em>(Advanced Curing)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, while in combat, their <small>ENDURANCE</small> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. This emergency ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
<h5><a name="assimila">Assimilance <em>(Advanced Invisibility)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of one to three days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques which make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.</p>
<h5><a name="hntmstry">Grand Huntmastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and they possess great natural speed and agility. They also have a superb sense of touch and taste. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p>
<h5><a name="pthmnshp">Grand Pathsmanship</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by hostile plants. Also they have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.</p>
<h5><a name="kaisurge">Kai-surge</a></h5>

<p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, New Order Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (Kai-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously). New Order Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>
<h5><a name="kaiscrn">Kai-screen</a></h5>

<p>During psychic combat, New Order Grand Masters are able to construct mind-fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="nexus">Grand Nexus</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to withstand contact with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="gnosis">Telegnosis <em>(Advanced Divination)</em></a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far fewer ill effects. Duration of the spirit-walk and the protection afforded to his inanimate body increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="magi">Magi-magic <em>(Old Kingdom Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of Old Kingdom battle-magic. These arcane skills include the use of basic Old Kingdom Spells, such as <i>Shield</i>, <i>Power Word</i>, and <i>Invisible Fist</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="alchemy">Kai-alchemy <em>(Brotherhood Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf and Guildmaster Banedon (the leader of Sommerlund’s Guild of Magicians), you have mastered the elementary spells of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells include <i>Lightning Hand</i>, <i>Levitation</i>, and <i>Mind Charm</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Brotherhood magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="astrolgy">Astrology</a></h5>

<p>The celestial bodies which occupy the skies above Magnamund have long been known to affect the lives of its inhabitants. Mastery of this Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to predict and shape the future by studying the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the myriad planets and stars. The number and accuracy of these predictions increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="herbmst">Herbmastery</a></h5>

<p>Mastery of this New Order Discipline enables a Grand Master to identify readily any substance derived from living or growing organic material. He is aware of any secret uses to which an organic material may be put, and he is skilled in effecting the release of a substance’s medicinal and/or magical properties.</p>
<h5><a name="element">Elementalism</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. By drawing upon individual elements that are available, or combinations thereof, he is able to detach, affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove, or accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, e.g. create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove air, intensify fire. The versatility of this Discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="bardsman">Bardsmanship</a></h5>

<p>Through mastery of this Discipline a Kai Grand Master of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of legend, mimic speech or dialect, and stimulate a wide range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect and power of his bardic abilities will steadily increase as he advances through the Grand Master ranks.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 22 of the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series, you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in Book 23. For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original five Disciplines you begin with, you may add 1 point to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> score and 2 points to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original five Grand Master Disciplines, your Kai Weapon,<sup><a href="#discplnz-1-foot" name="discplnz-1">1</a></sup> and any other Special Items and Backpack Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>New Order</cite> adventure, which is called: <a href="../lw/23mh.htm#title"><cite>Mydnight’s Hero</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you leave Elzian and begin your long voyage south to the Isle of Lorn, you acquire a <a href="#map">map of southeastern Magnamund</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much money is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed the previous <cite>New Order</cite> adventure (Book 21), you may add this sum to the number of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterstaff (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Bow (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows; record them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />

</ul>
<p>List the five items that you have chosen on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the appropriate headings, and make a note of any effect that they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and/or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="kaiweapn">Kai Weapons</a></h4>

<p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the élite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>
<p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a href="#action">Special Items List</a>. If you have completed the previous <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure (Book 21), you already possess a Kai Weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Say you choose the number 8 from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Broadsword ‘Illuminatus’.</p>
<p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you were to use ‘Illuminatus’ in combat against an enemy in an underground cavern, cave, or tunnel, you could add the higher bonus of 7 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you were to fight this enemy in any other location, the bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> would remain at 5.</p>

<h4><a name="howuse">Equipment—How to use it</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct Weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this Weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful Weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is best to equip yourself also with a close combat Weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is 12.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai Weapon</dt>
<dd>Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal Weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This is in addition to the bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your five Disciplines, then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency most readily accepted in southeastern Magnamund is the Noble. These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Nobles. Gold Crowns are readily accepted at a rate of 1 Gold Crown for 1 Noble.<br /><br />
</dd>

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
You, Grand Master (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. You also possess the Kai Weapon ‘Ulnarias’, so you add an additional 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This gives you a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 45.<br /><br />
You now subtract the Wild Dogs’ <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45−31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself—Grand Master.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>You (GM) lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
<li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of New Order Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>New Order</cite> series, you will gain an additional Grand Master Discipline and progress towards the pinnacle of Kai perfection—to become a Kai Supreme Master.</p>

<h3><a name="imprvdsc">Improved Grand Master Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Grand Mastery you will find that your Disciplines will steadily improve.</p>
<h4><a name="superior">Kai Grand Master Superior</a></h4>

<p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy’s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Astrology</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Herbmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two pints of water per day can be purified using this skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Elementalism</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of one large bucketful of fresh water.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to utilize their musical skills to pacify an excited or hostile animal.<br /><br />
</dd>

<p>The nature of additional improvements and how they affect your existing Grand Master Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Grand Master Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> books.</p>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>For three days you are treated to the lavish hospitality of the Elder Magi and the freedom of the wondrous city of Elzian. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, having fully recovered from the rigours of your journey to Dessi, you meet with Lord Rimoah in the Tower of Truth to discuss the final stage of your quest—the voyage to the Isle of Lorn. He informs you that passage has been arranged for you aboard a Suhnese trading ship called <cite>The Azan</cite> which sails tomorrow at dawn. The ship’s master, Captain Jenkshi, has been paid generously to carry you to his home port of Suhn, and you can expect to be well treated by him and his crew. It will be a long voyage, some 2,500 miles in all, but not all of it will be spent at sea. <cite>The Azan</cite> will put in at several ports along the way, both to trade and to take on fresh supplies of food and water. Rimoah reminds you of the need for secrecy—nobody must know the real purpose of your journey. Jenkshi and his men have been told that you are simply a courier who is carrying official papers for the attention of Lord Zinair, the Dessian ambassador to Suhn. On arriving at Suhn you are to contact Lord Zinair who will arrange for your passage across the Sea of Dreams to the Isle of Lorn. Before you leave the Tower of Truth and return to your chambers, Lord Rimoah examines the satchel in which you carry the Moonstone. Its special korlinium lining meets with his approval.</p>
<p>‘Lone Wolf has prepared you well for your mission,’ he says, as he secures the buckle. ‘I’m sure I have no need to remind you to keep this bag closed at all times. You are about to venture through dangerous territory, and there are many who would give anything to possess the contents of this satchel. You would be wise to trust only yourself, Grand Master.’ (If you have not already done so, record the Moonstone on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You carry it slung over your shoulder in its leather satchel.)</p>
<p>Rimoah escorts you to your room and tells you that he will call for you at an hour before dawn to take you to the quay. As he bids you goodnight, a doleful bell rings out in some distant part of the city. Rimoah’s eyes fill with sadness.</p>
<p>‘What does the bell mean, my lord?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘It signifies the passing of Lord Casis. He, too, is about to begin a journey. Alas, it will be his last. I must go now—I am being summoned to witness his departure.’</p>
<p>As he leaves, Rimoah pauses for a moment and then glances back over his shoulder. ‘You are welcome to accompany me if you wish, Grand Master. The passing of an Elder is a rare and special occasion. You may learn much from what you see.’</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>When first you enter the mists, it seems as if you are no longer sailing upon a sea of water. It becomes a blended sea and sky of deep blue light, without horizon or boundary—a limitless space. Gradually you detect vague shadows passing quickly by, and then distant sounds, like muffled whispers, surging then pulsing away before you can catch the words. Then you see globes of darkness hovering to and fro, and your Kai senses scream a warning that these are invaders, evil intruders in this realm of ghostly mist. They grow in numbers and begin to spiral around your boat, whispering and laughing and babbling all the while. You can feel your boat gradually slowing until it ceases to move at all. Fear grips you when you realise that these mischievous black spheres have the power to hold you prisoner, to keep you from ever reaching the shores of Lorn. Suddenly the vague sounds and voices in your mind begin to crystallize into words that you can understand.</p>
<p><i>You have proved your physical courage, foolish follower of Kai. But now you must put your mental strength to the test if you wish to find the Isle of Lorn.</i></p>
<p>The eerie voice laughs and you steel yourself to meet its mental challenge.</p>

<p>You concentrate on the wall of the hut, at a point directly opposite the guarded door, and then you summon forth the Old Kingdom power-word <i>Gloar!</i> The concussion of your spell-word hits the wall and punches a ragged hole through its bamboo timbers. You run at this hole and charge the weakened wall with your shoulder. It cracks and splits open, enabling you to force yourself through the gap and escape.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect308">Turn to 308</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>You fight your way to the surface of the churning sea and gulp a lungful of air. All about you are flailing lumps of debris, foaming bubbles, and treacherous strands of rope and canvas that threaten to entangle your limbs and drag you to your doom. Breathing hard, you fill your lungs and feed oxygen to your blood before diving deep below the flotsam of the dying ship. You surface beyond the debris and swim for the shore, now less than a mile distant.</p>
<p>The waves bring you ashore upon a rocky beach where you crawl for shelter among boulders at the base of a chalk cliff. From here you see the wreck of the <cite>Vargas</cite> come drifting towards the shoreline to be smashed to pieces on the rocks. Gangs of men are pacing the beach, salvaging cargo and slaying any crewman who is washed ashore alive. They are wreckers, and your Kai senses tell you that they are led by an evil magician who possesses great power. You can feel the aura of his presence nearby, high upon the cliffs, and you know that he has been responsible for the wicked destruction of the <cite>Vargas</cite> and its crew.</p>
<p>Using your Kai camouflage skills to keep yourself hidden from the wreckers, you hurry away along the rocky coast. During your escape, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>You follow Melchar through a maze of passages which lead all the way back to The Song of the Silver Star tavern, and the young journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having escaped from Wrok’s henchmen when finally you enter the sanctuary of the inn’s crowded taproom. The innkeeper asks Melchar if his happy mood is due to a win at the derby. He tells him that, thanks to your advice, he did not bet and therefore he did not lose.

<p>As the last of the thugs exhales his final breath and crashes to the ground, you make a cursory search of their bodies and discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 Daggers</li>
<li>2 Swords</li>
<li>3 Gold Crowns</li>

<p>You hurry along the alley and emerge into an open courtyard. Here the women of Masama are selling their wares, spread out upon gaily-decorated market stalls. Unlike at the warehouses and emporia of the quayside, the people who attend this market all appear to be natives of the city. As you pass by one stall you overhear two women talking about a place called Kitaezi. One of them insists that the whole city has been placed under a curse. You are about to turn back and ask them more about this city when suddenly you are approached by a tall woman who is swathed from head to foot in a fine blue robe. Anxiously she asks if you are a healer, and her piercing grey eyes continually dart to the satchel slung over your shoulder. It is as if she knows that you are carrying the Moonstone.</p>
<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that she means you no harm. You sense that she is greatly troubled and, when you ask what is wrong, she says that her daughter, Harni, is gravely ill. She pleads with you to come and help her and, although you deny that you are a healer, you feel compelled to answer her desperate plea for help.</p>

<p>You take your seats and the croupier deals out five cards to each player. Gregor wins the first round, and the second, and the third. Very soon it becomes apparent that he is quite an expert at Lourdenian Draw. After little more than a dozen rounds of play he has collected over 50 Nobles. For your part, you make use of your Magnakai Disciplines to help you win a more modest sum.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If the number you have picked is odd (i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), you win 4 Nobles. If the number you have picked is even (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0) you win 6 Nobles (1 Noble = 1 Gold Crown).</p>
<p>The other players become disgruntled and one by one they leave the table. Soon there are not enough players to be able to continue, and when no new players come forward the croupier declares the game closed. Grinning like a well fed cat, Gregor pockets his winnings and together you leave the Lucky Horse Inn and continue your walk along the main street. Soon you arrive at the Lourdenian Consulate where a guard at the gate allows you both to enter and wait in its cool, tree-shaded courtyard. A few minutes later you are met by the consul’s assistant, a rotund little official called Cheary. He is shocked to hear of the pirate attack, and he urges Gregor to accompany him inside the consulate to make a full written report. He says that it could take several hours, possibly even a day or two, and so you decide that now is a good time to say farewell to your companion. Before you go, Gregor offers you his heartfelt thanks for all you have done for him, and he hopes that one day soon your paths will cross again.</p>
<p>‘If you should ever visit Pforodon,’ he says, ‘stop by the Singing Lamb Tavern on Spike Street. If I’m not there, the landlord will know where you can find me.’</p>
<p>You wish Gregor a safe journey home, and then you leave the consulate and make your way back along the main street to the harbour. The heat and dust of the afternoon are making you thirsty and so you stop to drink from a freshwater fountain set into the wall of a crumbling old temple. The hustle and noise of the street crowd is becoming oppressive and you yearn to find somewhere quiet where you can rest before you return to the ship. Looking around, you notice two places which promise some respite. The first is a public park which stands upon a cliff that looms above the city to the east of the harbour wall. The second is a narrow, deserted alley that wends its way into the city’s Old Quarter.</p>

As you ascend the beach, instinct prompts you to unbuckle your satchel and remove the Moonstone which is now aglow and throbbing rhythmically, like the beat of a giant’s heart. As you raise it before you, cupped reverently in both hands, the clouds part and you are bathed in a cone of brilliant sunlight.</p>

<p>You climb the stairs to the foredeck and scan the horizon for signs of a pirate raider. Less than a mile away you can see a huge vessel with a purple mainsail sailing towards the strait. Captain Radyard appears at your side and he views the approaching craft through his telescope.</p>
<p>‘Weigh anchor!’ he orders. ‘Unfurl all canvas. I want every ounce of speed she’ll give us, lads.’ The captain’s urgent orders stir the crew into a frenzy of activity. As they set about their duties, you ask Radyard what is wrong. Without taking his eye from his telescope he says:</p>
<p>‘That’s Sesketera’s flagship—<cite>The Triasus</cite>. I’d recognize her sails anywhere. That scoundrel must want you badly to have sent the pride of his battle fleet after the likes of us.’</p>
<p>With all canvas lowered, the <cite>Seasprite</cite> cuts a rapid course through the glassy blue waters of Kastrow’s Door.

<p>You awake early the following morning, just as the pre-dawn light is brightening the night sky. Captain Jenkshi and his crew have also risen early to ensure that <cite>The Azan</cite> is the first ship to leave Zharloum this morning. Shortly before dawn they weigh anchor and turn the ship about, and by the time the sun crests the horizon, you are already more than a mile away from Zharloum harbour, riding the morning tide ahead of a bracing westerly wind. Jenkshi tells you that the next port of call will be the city-state of Ghol-Tabras where you will dock in four days’ time to take on supplies of fresh water.</p>
<p>The first day out of Zharloum passes without incident. Then, around noon of the second day, the ship heads south as it leaves the Tentarium and enters the Gulf of Ralzuha. You are sitting on the foredeck, enjoying the sun and the splendid views of the rugged isles and coastline, when suddenly you notice something in the distance that makes your pulse race. You magnify your vision and see that it is a plume of smoke. It is rising from the hull of a burning ship located close to a cluster of rocky islets. As <cite>The Azan</cite> draws closer, you are able to see that a flag is hanging from a broken masthead which lies draped over the vessel’s smouldering stern. It is a green flag with scarlet edging, surmounted by a large silver fish. The sight of this flag makes you swallow hard for it is identical to the flag that flies from the mast of <cite>The Azan</cite>. It is the flag of a Suhnese trader.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration II]</div>
<p>When Captain Jenkshi and his men first see this flag for themselves, they become very anxious about what may have happened to the crew of this stricken vessel. Many of them have fathers, sons, and brothers who work Suhnese ships in these waters. They urge the captain to search for survivors and he grants his consent readily.</p>
<p>‘Steer towards the wreck, Tolshi,’ he says, ordering his helmsman to change course, ‘and I want all other hands on deck immediately. Everyone is on lookout duty.’</p>

<p>You leave the tavern door and walk back along the waterfront. Beyond the ferry station is a marine timber yard and a chandler’s warehouse. The smell of freshly-sawn timber reminds you of the Fryelund Forest which surrounds your Kai Monastery. It is a memory that makes you feel a little homesick. The timber yard is deserted and so you decide that you will sleep this night among its fragrant stacks of pine and mountain oak.</p>

His sudden shriek of agony alarms the marines and, in the confusion, you are able to take a deep breath and throw yourself over the side.</p>
<p>Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus soon frees you from the cord that binds your wrists and you strike out for the distant shore. Only once you have passed beyond the shadow of Sesketera’s flagship do you dare come up for air. As you break the surface, you notice that the crew of <cite>The Triasus</cite> are scouring the sea, straining themselves to catch a glimpse of where you are. A marine on the prow deck spots you and, to your surprise, Sesketera’s crew begin to laugh and jeer.</p>

After a brief rest you press on through the dense moss-covered trees, relying solely upon your tracking skills to keep you moving in a southerly direction. At last you emerge from the jungle and rejoin the trail shortly after dawn the following day. In the distance you see a bridge across a steep-banked river. A glance at your <a href="#map">map</a> tells you that this is a tributary of the River Ito, and you decide to stop here to rest for an hour before continuing your hard trek to Caeno on foot.</p>

<p>Your heart misses a beat the instant you recognize the face of this unhappy young woman. It is Oriah, the highborn daughter of the Funtal of Fio Fadali, the runaway who travelled with you aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> on its ill-fated voyage out of Barrakeesh. Ever since she was abducted in the mountain town of Kilij you thought it unlikely that you would ever see her again. Yet here she sits, alone and dejected in a hall that is overflowing with an abundance of riches.</p>
<p>‘Oriah?’ you whisper hesitantly, hardly daring to believe that it is really her. She raises her head and her eyes widen with shocked surprise when she sees you. Then a smile, filled with hope and joy, lights up her tear-streaked face. She leaps from her chair and comes running to you to throw herself into your arms.</p>
<p>‘Oh, Grand Master,’ she sobs, ‘I never thought that I’d see you again. How did you know that I was here?’</p>
<p>You tell Oriah of what has happened since you arrived in Ghol-Tabras, and that you had no idea that she was here at all. She explains that after she was abducted by slavers in Kilij, she was sold to Sesketera who brought her here to his citadel. She is to be kept imprisoned in this hall until their wedding day, one month from now.</p>
<p>‘Let us escape from this place together,’ you say, but she shakes her head.</p>
<p>‘No, it cannot be. Sesketera is holding my friends. They are his hostages. If I leave the citadel before our wedding day he will put them to the sword. I cannot leave. But I know how I may help you to escape. Come, Grand Master, follow me.’</p>

<p>You swallow a mouthful of the food and, to your surprise, it tastes remarkably good. Yet after a few moments you suddenly sense that something is seriously wrong. You begin to feel faint and light-headed, and you are having difficulty focusing clearly.</p>
<p>Automatically your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus works to counteract the powerful narcotic that has been added to the food. It induces you to vomit (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), and then it swiftly neutralizes the remaining toxins from your blood. The bald man realises from your reaction to his drugged food that you are a follower of the God Kai. He shrieks with rage and curses you in a vile language that you do not recognize. Even so, the mere sound of his curses sends a shiver of dread coursing down your spine, like a trickle of icy-cold water. He denounces you to the others as an agent of the City Council sent to spy on their meeting, and he orders them to attack and slay you. The men react slowly to his frantic commands. It is as if they are struggling to awaken from a deep sleep. You have no wish to fight these men and so you turn and run towards the park entrance to escape from them. As you reach the open gate, you glance over your shoulder to see that the bald man is preparing to hurl a dagger at your back.</p>

<p>The barman is reluctant to talk. You suspect the reason for this is because you have not had the courtesy to purchase some of his food and ale. When you repeat your question he replies curtly:</p>
<p>‘Lord Zinair of Dessi, you say. Yeah, I think I’ve heard of him. Lives in the North Quarter some place. Don’t know exactly. You’d be best asking the City Guards. They’ll be sure to sort you right.’</p>
<p>You thank the man for his advice and then you leave the tavern and continue along the avenue. At length you arrive at a busy market square. On the far side of this square you see a City Guard patrol who are policing the market.</p>
<p>Remembering the barman’s advice, you decide to approach them and ask for their assistance. You are confident that they will know where Lord Zinair can be found.</p>

<p>As the last gaoler drops his club and falls lifelessly to the grimy floor, you stagger back against the wall and gasp for air. When you have recovered from the exertion of this deadly unarmed combat, you immediately set about dragging the bodies away into the corners of the cell, beyond the field of vision of anyone who should look through the peep hole in the door.</p>
<p>While you are going about this grisly task, you notice an Iron Key hanging from a gaoler’s belt. (Mark this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You need not discard another item in its favour if you are already carrying the maximum number of Special Items.) You leave the cell and lock the door using the bolt, and then you hurry along the corridor to the guardroom to retrieve your confiscated equipment (you may now erase the asterisks from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>As you are sheathing your Kai Weapon into your belt, you hear the sound of footsteps descending a flight of stone steps at the far end of the corridor. More gaolers are approaching; they have been drawn to investigate this lower level by the dying cries of their brother guards.</p>
<p>Desperately you scan the walls of the guardroom for some means of escape and suddenly you see that there is one other exit from this room—a heavy oak door which is banded with strips of black iron. You rush to this door and twist its handle to discover it is locked. With the sound of the approaching footsteps growing ever louder in your ears, you take the Iron Key from your pocket and offer up a prayer to Ishir that it will open this door.</p>

<p>Angered by the pain you have dealt it, the creature turns its ghastly stare on you and hisses vehemently. Quickly you reach to your Kai Weapon in readiness to defend yourself from its attack. Yet it does not attack you; it continues to stalk its chosen target. Gemulkin frees himself from the wheel, but before he can get away, the beast is upon him like a hungry lion. It grabs him by the throat and lifts him off the deck. You race across the slippery decking and raise your weapon to strike the creature in the side. Callously the beast hurls Gemulkin into the sea and then spins around to face you. Your first blow opens a wound in its chest, making it shriek loudly.

You fight to maintain your grip as the powerful current sweeps you downstream, and you are propelled along for more than a mile before it finally deposits you on the opposite bank. As you drag the man from the water, you notice a group of huts in the distance. You are about to haul the unconscious man over your shoulder and set off towards them, when suddenly you detect that he has no pulse. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Curing you are able to restart his heart and empty the water from his lungs, yet you are unable to restore him to full consciousness.

<p>You leave the Tower of Truth and pass along a wide stone ramp that gently descends to the great canal that encircles the city of Elzian. Few of the city’s Vakeros natives are abroad at this early hour and the streets and avenues are empty and quiet. A warm mist wreathes the barges and ships that are moored along the canal bank and, in the pre-dawn twilight, these vessels take on a ghostly appearance.</p>
<p>By the time you find <cite>The Azan</cite>, the sun has broken through the mist and the city is beginning to stir. Captain Jenkshi and the crew of the Suhnese trader are busily preparing their ship to sail, yet they immediately stop their work to welcome you and Lord Rimoah aboard. Jenkshi is a lean, yellow-skinned man with wide almond eyes and a small blunt nose. His slick black hair is tied in a knot atop his head in the Suhnese style, a fashion that is also favoured by all his crewmen. He orders one of his men to show you to your cabin at the prow, but before you go you bid Lord Rimoah farewell and thank him for all that he and the Elder Magi have done to aid your quest.</p>
<p>By the time <cite>The Azan</cite> is ready to sail, the mist has vanished. Having inspected your cabin you return to the foredeck where you settle yourself in the sun and enjoy the ever-changing views of the lush farmlands and Vakeros settlements which border upon the canal. For 90 miles this waterway cuts a wide furrow through the southern jungle of Dessi. To the east the horizon is dominated by a solitary mountain, and you marvel at its snowy peak which is the steepest you have ever seen.</p>
<p>‘That’s <i xml:lang="x-dessian">Kas-kalahmout</i>,’ says one of the friendly Suhnese crewmen. ‘In your language, I think it has the meaning: <em>Chair of the Heavens</em>.’</p>
<p>By midday you come to the estuary of the canal and <cite>The Azan</cite> heads out into the open waters of the Gulf of Tentarium. Captain Jenkshi joins you on deck and offers to share some of his food. While you eat you learn from him that the voyage will take little more than three weeks to complete, including visits to ports of call along the way. You ask him about the notorious Shadakine pirates who plague these waters and he answers you with a shrug of his muscular shoulders.</p>
<p>‘Relax and enjoy the journey as best you can, my friend,’ he says, jovially, as he finishes his food and wipes his mouth on his silken shirt sleeve. ‘You’re in safe hands. I and my crew have sailed these waters all our lives and we’ve yet to meet a buccaneer we can’t outwit or outrun. Breathe easy. You’ve nothing to fear from those mangy curs.’</p>

You feel that you are very close to the source when suddenly, through the trees ahead, you see a clearing where a large crowd of tribal natives are gathered.</p>
<p>From the cover of the bordering undergrowth you watch a crow-faced man in tattered black robes standing at the centre of this crowd. He is uttering the chilling chant. Before him, on a stone altar, there lies the decaying remains of a body encased in rotting swathings. Your Kai senses reveal to you that the robed man is a Kitaezi Shaman, an evil necromancer who has enslaved these natives with his power. You sense also that it is the same power that was used to create the creature that attacked and slew your horse last night.</p>
<p>Suddenly the terrible sound of the chant ceases and the Shaman shrieks with rage. He points to where you are hiding and your heart sinks. He has detected your presence. He pounds the altar with his fist and to your horror, you see the decaying remains begin to shift and stir into life. The Shaman intones a dark spell and the grisly corpse leaves the altar and comes stalking towards you, its fleshless arms outstretched. Waves of psychic energy buffet your mind. They paralyse you and keep you from escaping. You summon your psychic Kai defences and break this powerful spell, yet it is now too late to turn and run from the Shaman’s horror—it is almost upon you. Instinctively you reach to your satchel for you sense that the Moonstone is all that can save you from this creature’s ghastly embrace.

<p>You call the Suhnese together and try to rally them to fight the city watch, but they are unarmed and they have little or no battle training. Quickly it becomes clear to you that if you force them to resist the city watch, you will be condemning them to needless injury or death. Wary of this, you attempt to lure the Shadakine soldiers away into one of the houses. Unfortunately, your brave effort is short-lived.

<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that, despite his threats, the bandit has no intention of chopping through the rope which anchors the bridge. To do so would lose him your horse, and horses are worth a great many Nobles in this region of Shadaki.</p>
<p>However, you decide to play along with their game. You raise your hands to give the impression that you are surrendering, and when they order you to return across the bridge, you pretend you do not understand. The axeman shouts to his accomplice who is hidden in the crevice. He tells him to stop pulling on the rope and he dutifully obeys. As the bridge ceases to sway, the axeman and one other walk across the bridge towards you. They stop just beyond sword reach and motion to you to lay down your Weapons and equipment. Slowly you lift the satchel off your shoulder. As the strap clears your head, you grip it tightly and take a swing at the axeman. The satchel catches him on the jaw and the weight of the Moonstone knocks him unconscious. His companion screams with anger and lunges at you with his sword, but you swiftly sidestep him and he loses his balance. With a fearful cry on his lips he falls over the side of the bridge and tumbles to his doom.</p>
<p>Quickly you remount your horse and coax him across to the far side. Angry voices echo from the gorge behind you as you spur him to the gallop and escape along the jungle trail beyond the bridge.</p>

<p>Oriah takes you to another antechamber where she opens a door concealed behind a hanging tapestry. A narrow torchlit passage lies beyond this door and together you follow it until you arrive at a domed alcove. Here Oriah touches the head of a marble statue and the alcove swivels open to reveal a balcony encircling a large hall. Peering over the parapet you see that it is the main entrance hall to Sesketera’s citadel. Its polished stone floor lies some twenty feet below the balcony, and its doors are guarded by two impressive warriors. They are attired in gold armour which glimmers in the weak rays of sunlight that are now filtering into the hall through its stained glass roof.</p>
<p>‘Wait a few moments,’ whispers Oriah. ‘They are the night guards. Dawn is breaking and soon their watch will be over. There is always a lapse before the morning guards come on duty. The doors will then be unmanned and you will be able to escape from the citadel without being seen.’</p>
<p>Minutes later, just as she predicted, the warriors march away and leave the doors to the citadel unguarded. Oriah wishes you good luck, but as she leans forward to kiss you fondly on the cheek, a stern voice suddenly shatters the silence of the hall.</p>
<p>‘Oriah! What deceit is this!’</p>

<p>‘Sesketera…’ gasps Oriah. She snatches her hands to her mouth and then she swoons and faints. You catch her as she falls and you lay her carefully down upon the floor. Sesketera shouts for his guards until he notices that the hall below is empty. He curses their absence, and then he begins to move around the balcony towards you. He is unarmed—but not for long. He grabs a ceremonial weapon from a stand of armour and quickens his pace. As he levels this deadly spear at your chest you see that his eyes are filled with a blind, jealous rage.</p>

You are unable to see anything clearly, but you sense that there is something lying buried there. You tell the elder of your discovery and you see a flicker of fear in his old eyes. He says that there is nothing in the hut that could be of interest to the dragon, but your senses tell you otherwise. They also tell you that he is lying.</p>
<p>A group of villagers armed with long spears rush to the hut and attempt to stab the dragon. The creature roars at them and then flaps its leathery wings and begins to circle around the settlement once more. You slip away from your hiding place and hurry down to the ruins for you are determined to discover what it is that the dragon is seeking. Guided by your Sixth Sense, you uncover a bronze statuette from beneath the ashes. Then the dragon returns. It lashes out at the villagers with its clawed forelimbs and smashes their spears to matchwood. The men retreat in confusion and the dragon lands and settles itself beside the hut. You move to unsheathe your weapon but you freeze when suddenly the dragon speaks to you. The creature has the voice of a man.</p>
<p>The dragon pleads with you for the return of the statuette, for he says that it will remove the curse that has changed his shape. Your Kai senses detect that the creature speaks the truth, and that he is not the evil bane that the elder and the villagers have led you to believe. You notice that the elder and his men have left their hiding places and are now running towards the hut. You focus on the elder and see that a strange transformation has taken place. He is no longer the frail old man that he was; his face has become younger and it is contorted with a savage rage. Your Kai senses detect an aura of evil that is chillingly familiar. It is identical to that which surrounded Ulonga the Shaman and you sense that he, too, is a necromancer. He orders his men to take aim at you with their bows and blindly they obey his command.

He orders his crew to hoist the sails, and he tells his bo’sun to wave a white flag from the stern deck to signal to Sesketera that he is complying with his commands. A longboat is launched from <cite>The Triasus</cite> to collect you. It is carrying an officer and six marines, each armed with a half-pike and a Bor pistol. Radyard suggests that you go to the head of the boarding ladder so that you can surrender to the longboat’s officer when he comes aboard.</p>
<p>‘Who said anything about surrender?’ you retort.</p>
<p>‘But…I thought…,’ stutters the captain.</p>
<p>‘I’ve no intention of surrendering to Sesketera!’ you say, and before Radyard can utter another word, you vault over the gunwale and plunge feet-first into the clear blue sea.</p>

<p>You leave the taverna and follow the road into dense timberland. It is an uncomfortably hot and humid region, and you are made to feel even more uncomfortable by swarms of tiny insects that bite any exposed areas of your flesh (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).

<p>The dragon lands at his lair in the mountains and folds his wings to allow you to climb down easily from his scaly back. Carefully you place the bronze statuette into his clawed hand and witness a wondrous transformation take place. Slowly the dragon shrinks and its body changes into that of a tall man with a proud and noble countenance. He introduces himself to you as Cresosa, the leader of the Rivorzha tribe who dwell on the eastern slopes of the Hulhuk Mountains. Unlike the villagers, Cresosa’s people have resisted Ulonga’s evil rule, even though their resistance has forced them out of their coastal villages to seek refuge in the mountains. The statuette has broken a curse placed upon Cresosa by Ulonga the Shaman, and now he is able to return to his people and lead them back to their abandoned homes.</p>
<p>Before you say farewell, Cresosa offers you two Potions of Laumspur (each of these Backpack Items will restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when swallowed after combat). He then gives you directions which take you back to the trail, to a place where a bridge crosses a steep-banked river.

Without a word they leave their tables and move towards the door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade as they go. With the threats and crude curses of the Eldenorans ringing in your ears, you walk away from the Three Capstans Inn and return to the harbour.

Gradually you detect vague shadows passing quickly by, and then distant sounds, like muffled whispers, surging then pulsing away before you can catch the words. Then you see globes of darkness hovering to and fro, and your Kai senses scream a warning that these are invaders, evil intruders in this realm of ghostly mist. They grow in numbers and begin to spiral around your boat, whispering and laughing and babbling all the while. You feel your boat gradually slowing until it ceases to move at all.

<p>The two-day voyage to Nhang passes swiftly and without incident and you arrive at the port early on the morning of the third day. The entrance to Nhang harbour is noted for its eighty fearsome stone statues, known as ‘The Warriors of Nhang’, which stand in two lines and form a double colonnade out into the sea. Their ferocious granite faces glare down at you unmercifully as the <cite>Embassage</cite> sails between them and docks at the quay.</p>
<p>Before you disembark, Captain Leonghi warns you to be on your guard while you are in the city. The natives still harbour loyalties to the memory of Shasarak, and recent uprisings have led to the imposition of a dusk-to-dawn curfew. He advises you to go directly to the city of Tiklu and seek out his cousin Gemulkin. He, too, is a merchant captain and he regularly plies a trader between Tiklu and the Port of Suhn. Leonghi gives you a scroll (record this Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as Leonghi’s Scroll; you keep it in a pocket of your tunic). It is a letter of introduction which bears his seal, and in it he asks his cousin to take you to Suhn.</p>
<p>You thank the captain for all his help and then disembark onto Nhang quay. You leave the port area and follow The Street of the Full Moon—the main thoroughfare which bisects the city and ends at its West Gate. Your first impressions of Nhang are mixed. The striking design and construction of its buildings amaze you, but the dismal mood of its natives and the large number of street beggars leave you with the feeling that the city could erupt at any time.</p>
<p>You pass many hundreds of shops and they all appear dingy and uninteresting until you happen upon a triangular building, created by a fork in the road. It has no sign stating its business, but by the nature of the various goods displayed in its window you judge it to be an emporium.</p>

<p>You meet with Melchar as planned, and after a meagre breakfast at the inn, you follow the crowds who are making their way through the streets to the Caeno racetrack. This magnificent establishment dominates the city’s eastern quarter and it has provided the venue for this spectacular derby for more than a century. Unlike the famous horse races held in Slovia and Lourden, the Caeno Derby is run by guanza—large bipedal lizards that are bred and trained throughout the Southlands. Huge sums are bet on the big race and the owner of the winning guanza stands to collect a purse of 100,000 Nobles.</p>
<p>On entering the racetrack you and your companion make your way through the crowds to the parade enclosures. Melchar is keen to bet on the favourite—Forlu-zhan—but he wants to view the other runners before placing his wager with Wrok the Bookmaker. Having satisfied himself that the favourite will win, he goes off to the betting ring while you stay at the enclosure and watch the guanza lope past. As Forlu-zhan passes by, your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control tells you that something is wrong. You sense that the favourite has been drugged with a mild tincture of graveweed and that he will be incapable of winning the race. Quickly you hurry to the betting ring to stop Melchar placing his wager. He is about to hand over his money when you catch up with him and tell him what you know. Melchar cancels his bet and Wrok the Bookmaker glares at you with undisguised hatred. He signals to a group of his henchmen and swiftly they surround you both. The moment the race begins you and Melchar are grabbed from behind and manhandled out of the betting ring. Wrok’s henchmen bundle you into a tack room below the public stands, but before they can lock the door, you draw your weapon and attack them.</p>

<p>Your Kai senses alert you to danger as you draw closer to the burning wreck. You warn the captain and at first he is sceptical. Then he, too, senses that something is greatly amiss and he orders the crew to hoist the mainsail in order to reduce speed. His caution is soon rewarded when suddenly a Shadakine man o’war breaks cover from between two rocky islets and comes surging towards <cite>The Azan</cite>. Jenkshi orders the crew to lower the mainsail once more and begin evasive action, but the wind is starting to change and this greatly hampers his escape plan.</p>
<p>You magnify your vision and scour the prow and foredecks of the approaching ship. It is dressed with the scarlet sails of a Shadaki buccaneer vessel and it is sitting very low in the water. You hazard a guess that it must be fully laden with booty stolen from the hold of the burning trader. With the wind going against him, Jenkshi takes a calculated gamble. He orders his helmsman to steer towards a narrow channel between two nearby islets. He is hoping that his lighter craft will be able to pass through the shallows here and gain precious time while the heavier enemy ship will be forced to go around the isles to avoid running aground. It is a bold manoeuvre, and one that is made all the more dangerous when the enemy captain suddenly turns his vessel and runs it parallel to <cite>The Azan</cite>. To your horror you see that the Shadakine man o’war is armed with deck cannons. As it gains on your ship you see clouds of white smoke and flame erupt all along its hull. Then seconds later you hear the rumbling roar of its cannons, followed closely by the terrifying shriek of its deadly ball and chain shot as it comes hurtling through the air towards your vulnerable ship.</p>

<p>The woman leads you through the shabby streets of Masama to her house on the boundary of the town’s wealthy quarter. It is a two-storey dwelling, modest in comparison to others nearby yet richly appointed, with servants, a stable, and a fragrant orchard of guyan trees. You are ushered upstairs to where a young girl lies in a darkened room. She has a fever and a sickly grey pallor that makes her look more than twice her age. You recognize at once that she is suffering from Mysua. It is a disease that is spread by swamp flies and is not uncommon among the jungle-dwellers of Shadaki.</p>
<p>Using your Magnakai Curing skills, and aided by the presence of the Moonstone, you are able to neutralise the infection that has ravaged this young girl’s body. Within a few hours her fever has disappeared and a healthy colour returns to her face. She shows every sign they she will make a complete recovery. Her mother is overjoyed and she thanks you repeatedly. She insists that you stay here as her guest and she provides you with your own room overlooking the river.</p>
<p>Over a delicious evening meal prepared by her servants, you learn that her name is Tiosanna. She is the widow of a wealthy trader who was killed at sea when his ship was attacked and plundered by buccaneers. When her only daughter recently fell ill with fever, she feared she was going to lose her as well. She rarely goes to the market, yet a strange compulsion made her go today. She cannot explain, but the moment she saw you she knew that it was within your power to save her daughter’s life.</p>
<p>You retire early to bed and sleep soundly (you may restore 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). When you rise at dawn, you are feeling fresh and eager to continue your journey to the Isle of Lorn. In appreciation for saving her daughter’s life, Tiosanna gives you a horse. Gladly you accept her generous gift and you bid them both a fond farewell before you set off along ‘The Dragon’s Tail’—the name given by the natives of this region to the overland route from Masama to the city of Kitaezi.</p>
<p>After consulting your <a href="#map">map</a> you estimate that it should take you no more than two days to reach Kitaezi. The weather has settled and the overland trail proves far smoother than its given name implies. By mid-afternoon you have covered more than 50 miles and you are pleased with your progress.</p>
<p>You are passing through a range of forested hills and gullies when you come to an unexpected fork in the trail. A signpost says that both branches of this fork lead to Kitaezi, yet it does not give any indication which is the shorter or the safer route to take.</p>

<p>Your room is located at the rear of the tavern, next to the communal lavatory. You draw upon your Kai skills to suppress your sense of smell and prop a solitary chair beneath the door handle to keep it shut.

<p>Hurriedly you climb these stone steps and come to a landing where several corridors converge. Some are occupied by gaolers and other officials of Sesketera’s citadel who are going about their duties. Then you hear the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs behind you, and it reminds you of the pressing need to keep moving. You draw upon your Magnakai Disciplines of Huntmastery and Pathsmanship to help in choosing the best route and, to your surprise, in so doing you discover a secret panel in the wall at the head of the staircase.

It is a porcelain figurine of a small child which has uncannily lifelike eyes.</p>
<p>‘Ah, you’re a Sommlending, and you’re a connoisseur too I see,’ says a reedy voice. From behind a stand of rusty armour there suddenly appears a little old man. He squints at you through his thick spectacles and wrinkles his face into the semblance of a smile.</p>

Stung by their rude remarks, you decide that you are in desperate need of a bath and so you go down to the river bank to wash away the worst of the grime. While you are here you notice that the two halves of the town are connected by a series of wooden bridges. The opposite side of the river is home to the business district.

After a few bruising minutes your wagon emerges from the gloomy streets and ascends a smooth ramp which passes through the daunting gate of Ghol-Tabras gaol. Above this gate flutters a flag which depicts a black serpent entwined around the blade of a silver scimitar. It is the personal emblem of Sesketera, the ruler of this city, a man not known for his kindness or for his mercy.</p>

<p>As you deal the creature the killing blow, its body crackles and disintegrates into a million motes of light that dissolve into the darkness like a swarm of fleeing fireflies. You rush to aid your horse who is lying motionless among the boulders, but sadly you discover that it is already too late to save him.</p>
<p>Fear and uncertainty haunt you as patiently you await the dawn. The being that attacked and slew your mount was not of this world; it was a creature born wholly of evil magic. With a gnawing sense of dread, you leave at first light and follow the jungle trail to the west. The forest and vegetation are teeming with life, yet as you go deeper into the jungle so the sounds become fewer and more distant. By midday you have covered 20 miles and arrived at a place where there are no sounds at all. The eerie silence surrounds you for several miles further until your Kai hunting skills detect a faint noise. It drifts towards you from among the towering trees to the right of the jungle path. Cautiously you leave the trail and make your way towards the source of this solitary sound.</p>

<p>Tzai’s house is located in the centre of the city, opposite the main market square and its municipal buildings. It is a large dwelling and much of it is a warehouse given over to the storage of his goods. You are greeted by his family and he takes great delight in introducing them to you. You meet his brother Chinn, his wife Tuvei, his two teenage daughters Leadu and Leiga, and his young son Undai. His wife and children seem very pleased to have you staying as a guest, but his brother Chinn views you with suspicion. You can tell from his cold reaction that he does not think very highly of foreigners.</p>
<p>Later you share supper with the family and you tell Tzai that tomorrow you will look for Captain Leonghi’s cousin, Gemulkin. You hand him the scroll that the captain gave you and he passes it to his brother. He says that Chinn has many friends at the dock and he asks his brother if he recognizes the name. Chinn shakes his head tersely and barely glances at the scroll before handing it back. He then leaves the table and goes to his room. As you watch him leave, your Sixth Sense tells you that he knows Gemulkin very well.</p>
<p>After supper, Tzai invites you on a tour of his warehouse. While you are looking at the hundreds of fascinating items that he sells, you suddenly hear shouting coming from outside in the main market square. A noisy mob has gathered to denounce Dhanchai, the city’s mayor. They are demanding that Koogha, a former Shadakine warlord, be returned to power. The city militia arrive to disperse this unruly crowd, but a struggle breaks out and soon the two sides are fighting openly in the square. Suddenly the warehouse door bursts open and a dozen men armed with knives and clubs begin to loot the shelves. Then Chinn comes running through from the house, alerted by the noise. He is armed with a stave with which he attacks the looters. One of them knocks it from his hand and another grabs him from behind and pins his arms to his side. Tzai screams as a third looter advances towards his helpless brother with a knife in his hand.</p>

<p>The walls of the armoury are lined with oaken racks containing many skilfully-crafted weapons. They are all of ancient design and many centuries old. Their gleaming blades have been kept in pristine condition, yet it strikes you that this chamber is more like a museum than an armoury. Clearly the Elder Magi have little need for conventional weapons.</p>

<p>The celebrations go on throughout the night, but you are able to find a quiet place to sleep for a few hours before dawn breaks over this happy city. When you tell the people that you must leave and continue your journey south, they are saddened by the news. They want you to stay as their new chieftain, but you persuade them that they must choose a new leader from among their own tribe. Before you leave they provide you with a mule and some food (enough for up to 3 Meals).</p>
<p>By mule you expect the overland journey from Kitaezi to Caeno to take no more than three days. It is a rough, potholed trail and yet your mule never once misses his footing or causes you to fall. During the afternoon of the second day you enter the foothills of the Hulhuk Mountains and see a plume of black smoke rising into the sky. It comes from behind a treeless ridge, less than half a mile from the trail. The sound of anguished voices can be heard on the wind and these cries prompt you to leave the trail and investigate. As you crest the ridge you see a small native village. Several of the huts are on fire and its people are trying desperately to save their livestock and quell the raging flames.</p>

<p>Once outside the main doors, you hurry across a wide stone bridge that spans the dry moat encircling Sesketera’s citadel. Ahead you can see a cobblestoned plaza which is flanked on three sides by municipal buildings and shops, and on its fourth side by barracks and stables. The sound of the alarm bell is beginning to awaken interest in the plaza. Faces peer from windows and you can see men running to and fro inside the barracks compound. Then the gate to the stables swings open and suddenly there appears a man on horseback. He is one of Sesketera’s guards and he comes galloping towards you with a lance levelled at your chest.</p>
<p>You skid to a halt and quickly focus on the rider’s horse. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, you command the horse to jump in the air. This has the effect of startling the horse and, in its confusion, it begins to buck and twist. The rider is thrown from his saddle and left sprawled unconscious on the ground. Now you use your Kai skills to calm the startled horse. As he settles down, you leap into his saddle and escape from the plaza at a gallop.</p>
<p>The incessant sound of the alarm bell follows you through the early-morning streets of Ghol-Tabras. Even as you reach the entrance to the harbour, more than a mile from the citadel, you can still hear it echoing over the rooftops. You look back over your shoulder and see that you are being followed by a dozen riders. They are citadel guards and they have been ordered to stop you at all costs. As you gallop along the harbour wall, your heart sinks when you see that <cite>The Azan</cite> is surrounded by soldiers. You race past them before they have a chance to load and fire their bows, but you soon come to the end of the harbour wall where you are forced to a halt. The bridge which spans the harbour entrance is too narrow to cross on horseback and so you abandon your mount and hurry across it on foot. You are nearing its centre when you see a trading ship passing directly below. It is leaving the harbour. Suddenly an arrow pierces your cloak and makes you freeze in your tracks. The soldiers are firing at you and, to your dismay, you see that they have sealed off both exits from the bridge. As they begin to move towards you from each side, firing as they advance, you climb onto the parapet of the bridge and attempt to leap onto the deck of the passing trader.</p>

<p>As you stagger to your feet from beneath the debris, you look along the main deck and see that brave Captain Jenkshi has taken over the helm. With grim determination he steers his battered ship relentlessly towards the channel. You see him cursing the enemy captain and shaking his fist defiantly at the villainous Shadakine gunners as their cannonballs whistle across the decks of <cite>The Azan</cite>; then a gust of wind fills the torn mainsail and the ship begins to pull away from the lumbering man o’war. A second broadside falls wide of its mark, and Jenkshi’s bold plan finally pays off when the enemy ship is forced to veer away for fear of beaching her hull in the shallows. The crew cheer loudly when they see her red sails falling away to the stern and <cite>The Azan</cite> is left alone to make a swift passage through the islet channel. You make your way along the debris-strewn deck to congratulate Jenkshi on his masterful display of seamanship. He accepts your praise and the cheers of his crew with a rueful smile, even though his skill and his coolness under enemy fire have undoubtedly saved the ship and the lives of all aboard. However, as the ship emerges on the far side of the islets, you soon discover that more than just Jenkshi’s bravery will be needed if everyone aboard <cite>The Azan</cite> is to live to tell the tale of their deadly encounter with the buccaneers of Shadaki.</p>

You then sit opposite the bearded man and soon discover that he is a merchant captain from Lunarlia. He is interested in buying copper but he will only offer you 4 Nobles for an ingot. It is a poor price and you tell him that you will have to speak with Captain Jenkshi before you can agree to his bid.</p>
<p>As you rise from your seat he tells you to wait a moment. Copper is not the only thing that he buys.

A few minutes later you are met by the consul’s assistant, a rotund little official called Cheary. He is shocked to hear of the pirate attack, and he urges Gregor to accompany him inside the consulate to make a full written report. He says that it could take several hours, possibly even a day or two, and so you decide that now is a good time to say farewell to your companion.

Seconds later you are up on your feet, your keen eyes scouring your surroundings for some sign of the threat. Your Kai skills are alerting you to an imminent and deadly danger, a hidden enemy who possesses a strong magical aura.</p>
<p>You unsheathe your Kai Weapon and crouch behind a boulder. Suddenly the air before you shimmers and takes form, causing you to gasp in disbelief. Something is growing out of the very darkness itself! You glimpse its misshapen head and hunched body; then its outline seems to waver.

<p>Fair weather returns and <cite>The Azan</cite> makes good speed as it crosses the jade-green waters of the Gulf of Tentarium. It is shortly before noon of the following day when the first glimpse of Zharloum is sighted by the lookout, and less than an hour later you find yourself sailing into the harbour of this grand city. Emerald pennants flutter from the towers and roofs of its sun-bleached houses, and crowds of industrious citizens throng its paved avenues and alleyways. This old Shadakine port has a long history of free and fair trading. It is many miles from the cities of Shadakine political power which lie to the south and, due to this fortunate fact, it has been spared much of the damage wrought upon this troubled land by a succession of ruthless and tyrannical rulers.</p>
<p>The ship enters and docks at the harbour wall, close to the jetty of a warehouse which contains the iron and copper ingots that it will carry to Suhn. As the crew begin the task of loading the cargo aboard, you decide to go and explore this thriving city. But after little more than an hour the heat, hustle, and noise of the crowded streets becomes oppressive and you find yourself yearning for somewhere quiet to rest before you return to the ship. Looking around, you notice two places which offer the promise of some respite from the teeming crowds. The first is a public park which stands upon a cliff that looms above the city to the east of the harbour wall.

<p>‘Only by virtue of your possession of the Moonstone can this voyage be undertaken with any hope of success,’ he says. ‘I have been in mind-contact with the Shianti, and they are ready to receive you.’</p>
<p>You sense that Zinair is proud of your successes and achievements during the quest so far, but you also sense that he is ill at ease and you ask him what is wrong.</p>
<p>‘The Moonstone will facilitate your passage through the Sea of Dreams to the Isle of Lorn, Grand Master. But you should know that this journey could still prove perilous. The Shianti no longer have control over the forces that exist within this enchanted region. Until you reach the shores of Lorn, your fate will be entirely in your own hands.’</p>

<p>Your Kai senses scream a warning that you are in great danger as you draw steadily closer to the burning wreck. You tell Jenkshi, but he is greatly sceptical of your seamanship and he ignores your advice. He is more concerned about finding survivors than listening to your vague warnings of danger. Unfortunately, he soon has cause to regret his decision when suddenly a Shadakine man o’war breaks cover from between two rocky islets and comes surging towards <cite>The Azan</cite>. Jenkshi immediately orders his crew to unfurl every last inch of canvas and take evasive action, but the wind is now beginning to change and this greatly hampers them as they struggle to carry out his orders.</p>

You hazard a guess that it must be fully laden with booty stolen from the hold of the burning trader. With the wind going against him, Jenkshi takes a calculated gamble. He orders his helmsman to steer towards a narrow channel between two nearby islets. He is hoping that his lighter craft will be able to pass through the shallows here and gain precious time while the heavier enemy ship will be forced to go around the isles to avoid running aground. It is a bold manoeuvre, and one that is made all the more dangerous when the enemy captain suddenly turns his vessel and runs it parallel to <cite>The Azan</cite>. To your horror you see that the Shadakine man o’war is armed with deck cannons. As it gains on your ship you see clouds of white smoke and flame erupt all along its hull. Then, seconds later, you hear the rumbling roar of its cannons, followed closely by the terrifying shriek of its deadly ball and chain shot as it comes hurtling through the air towards your vulnerable ship.</p>

Quickly you dismount and use your Kai Discipline of Animal Control to calm your startled horse. There seems to be no reason for the bridge to be pitching back and forth, but when you look over the side you catch sight of a rope that is attached to its underside. This line descends to a crevice in the wall of the gorge and it is being repeatedly pulled taut and then released. From out of the crevice there issues a commanding voice: ‘<em>Throw your money and possessions into the gorge!</em>’ When you hesitate to obey, the voice says: ‘<em>Do it now, or you’ll never get off the bridge alive!</em>’</p>

The only citizens to be seen abroad are the guards of the Harbour Watch who quickly approach once the ship is safely moored. A sly-faced sergeant informs Captain Jenkshi that a night curfew is in force, and that a mooring fee of 100 Nobles a day must be paid by all ships arriving after sunset. This is a huge charge and Jenkshi complains bitterly, but the sergeant merely laughs as his protests. ‘Pay the fee or forfeit your ship, captain,’ he sneers. Jenkshi asks that he be allowed to pay tomorrow, so that he may sell some of his cargo to offset the exorbitant fee, but the sergeant shakes his head and refuses his request out of hand. ‘The fee must be paid now,’ he growls, ‘and in coinage—not cargo.’</p>
<p>Reluctantly the captain pays the sergeant using every last Noble that he possesses, leaving him with no money to pay his crew or purchase fresh supplies of food and water in the morning. He tells the crew that he must sell some of the cargo to raise the money he needs. A sale must be arranged quickly for he cannot afford to stay in this harbour for more than a day. Jenkshi picks a handful of his best crew members and tells them to accompany him ashore to help him find someone who will be willing to buy his copper ingots.

Armed with studded clubs, they come to your cell with the intention of punishing you severely.

<p>You set off along the shore, keeping the waters of the Gulf of Serpents in sight to help you gauge your progress. The jungle bordering this coast is teeming with wildlife yet you detect no sign of tribal inhabitants. After your encounter with the natives of Dlash-da Ralzuha, you decide that perhaps this is a blessing. You spend the first night encamped on the beach, and then you begin your trek early the following day.</p>
<p>Fine weather, wild game, and an abundance of freshwater streams make your trek far easier than expected. On the fourth day you happen upon an ancient track that climbs into the hills and joins a newer trail. Your tracking skills reveal human footprints but your excitement wanes when you determine that they are more than six months old. Steadily the trail climbs higher into the hills until you lose sight of the gulf waters. As darkness approaches it begins to rain. Within an hour it has become a torrential downpour that turns the trail into a fast-flowing stream. It becomes impossible to continue and so you search for somewhere dry to spend the night. Your tracking skills lead you to a cave, but when you enter you realize at once that you are not the only creature seeking shelter here tonight. You see the glint of amber eyes at the rear of the cave and you detect growling, loud enough to be heard above the noise of the pounding rain. Your instincts tell you that there are two creatures lurking here in the recesses of the cave, and that they are both hungry, scared, and potentially dangerous.</p>

His face contorts with rage and your Kai senses detect an aura of evil that is chillingly familiar. It is identical to that which surrounded Ulonga the Shaman. Suddenly he snatches an amulet from a chain hanging around his neck and thrusts it at your mule. The air around it crackles and a bolt of energy leaps from his hand to strike the creature’s head, rendering it unconscious.

Then there is a noise over on the far side of the balcony and moments later three citadel guards come rushing through the open archway.</p>
<p>‘Kill him!’ shouts Sesketera, and he presses himself flat to the wall so that they are able to get to you. Looking down into the hall you can see that the main doors are still unguarded despite the incessant ringing of the alarm bell.

<p>You give Melchar your Blanket to cover his embarrassment and then you follow him through the alleyways of the east quarter which lead all the way back to The Song of the Silver Star tavern. The young journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having escaped from Wrok’s henchmen when finally you enter the sanctuary of the inn’s crowded taproom. The innkeeper asks Melchar if his happy mood is due to a win at the derby. He replies that, thanks to your advice, he did not bet. The only thing he lost was his breeches and he proceeds to tell the innkeeper how that came about. The innkeeper frowns.</p>
<p>‘Wrok’s not a man to cross, y’know,’ he warns. ‘He’s ruthless when it comes to getting even. I think you two had better stay in the attic tonight. Wrok’s sure to send his lackeys out a-huntin’ for you.’</p>
<p>You heed the innkeeper’s warning and spend the night hidden in his attic room. Before dawn breaks you slip out of the tavern by a back door and say farewell to Melchar in the street outside.</p>

<p>You decide to leave. On returning to the square you notice that there is something happening at the end of a street that leads away from the quay. You decide to investigate and you soon discover that the street leads to a large courtyard. Here the women of Masama are selling their wares, spread out upon gaily-decorated market stalls. Unlike at the warehouses and emporia at the quayside, the people who attend this market all appear to be natives of the city. As you pass by one stall you overhear two women talking about a place called Kitaezi. One of them is insisting that the whole city has been placed under a curse. You are about to turn back and ask her more about this city when suddenly you are approached by a tall woman who is swathed from head to toe in a fine blue robe. Anxiously she asks if you are a healer, and her piercing grey eyes continually dart to the satchel slung over your shoulder. It is as if she knows that you are carrying the Moonstone.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XII]</div>
<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that she means you no harm. You sense that she is greatly troubled, and when you ask what is wrong, she says that her daughter, Harni, is gravely ill.

<p>You throw yourself to the deck and take cover behind the wooden parapet of the prow as the enemy’s shot rips into the sails and rigging. Shredded canvas and splintered timbers fall about your ears, yet you survive this ferocious bombardment without sustaining the slightest injury. Bravely Captain Jenkshi takes over the helm and steers his battered ship relentlessly towards the channel. You see him cursing the enemy captain and shaking his fist defiantly at the villainous Shadakine gunners as their cannonballs whistle across the decks of <cite>The Azan</cite>. Then a gust of wind fills the torn mainsail and the ship begins to pull away from the lumbering man o’war. A second broadside falls wide of its mark, and Jenkshi’s bold plan finally pays off when the enemy ship is forced to veer away for fear of beaching her hull in the shallows. The crew cheer loudly when they see her red sails falling away to the stern, and <cite>The Azan</cite> is left alone to make a swift passage through the islet channel.</p>
<p>You pull yourself unsteadily to your feet and make your way along the debris-strewn deck to congratulate Jenkshi for his masterful display of seamanship. He accepts your praise and the cheers of his crew with a rueful smile, even though his skill and his coolness under enemy fire have undoubtedly saved the ship and the lives of all aboard. However, as the ship emerges on the far side of the islets, you soon discover that more than just Jenkshi’s bravery will be needed if everyone aboard <cite>The Azan</cite> is to live to tell the tale of their deadly encounter with the buccaneers of Shadaki.</p>

<p>Angered by the pain of its wound, the creature turns it ghastly stare on you and hisses vehemently. Quickly you shoulder your Bow and reach for your Kai Weapon in readiness to defend yourself from its attack. Yet it does not attack you; it continues to stalk its chosen target. Gemulkin frees himself from the wheel, but before he can get away, the beast is upon him like a hungry lion. It grabs him by the throat and lifts him off the deck. You race across the slippery decking and raise your weapon to strike the creature in the side. Callously the beast hurls Gemulkin into the sea and then spins around to face you. Your first blow opens a wound in its chest, making it shriek loudly. But it recovers and it lashes out at you to connect with your shoulder. The force of the blow knocks you sideways and sends you sliding across the slick deck to fall headlong through an open cargo hatch.</p>

Yet it is still the quickest way through this jungle territory and you stay with the track until it comes to the bank of the swollen River Ocka.

You are about to set off along the bank in search of somewhere to cross when suddenly you hear a desperate cry for help. You turn and see a man being swept downstream by the river.

<p>You hurry with Lord Rimoah through the corridors of the Tower of Truth towards the sound of the tolling bell, until at last you arrive at a chamber located below its vaulted presidium. Gathered here are the members of the High Council. They stand in a circle around the cloaked body of Lord Casis which lies upon a bed of shimmering crystals. A cocoon of light encases his frail form, its pale luminescence shedding an uncanny glow upon the faces of the surrounding elders. Rimoah joins them and, as you observe this eerie scene, you recall Lone Wolf’s teachings at the Kai Monastery.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XIII]</div>
<p>The Elder Magi are all that remain of the race of beings from whom all goodly magic stems. They were sent to Magnamund almost 10,000 years ago by the Gods Kai and Ishir to defeat Agarash the Damned, Naar’s first champion, and they triumphed in their task. Yet, in a later age their numbers were decimated by a plague and the few thousands who survived this tragedy sought refuge here in Dessi. The Elder Magi have always aided Sommerlund and have been loyal and invaluable allies to the Kai. But now their ancient power is waning, and the few thousands who survived the Great Plague now number less than a hundred.</p>
<p>Suddenly the bell ceases to toll and you watch in awe as the fragile remains of Lord Casis gradually fade from sight. He has ended his time here upon Magnamund and has passed over into the Plane of Light, the ethereal domain of the Gods Kai and Ishir. Silently the remaining elders file out of the chamber. As Lord Rimoah passes, he beckons you to follow him.</p>
<p>‘You are the first Kai who has ever witnessed the ascension of an Elder,’ he says, as he takes you back to your room. ‘Alas, our power ebbs with each passing year, for this is the twilight of our existence here on Magnamund. Yet, we embrace our fate, for even as we weaken and fade so the power of the New Order Kai grows stronger. This is the dawning of your Age, Grand Master.

<p>Melchar excuses himself and then goes to another table where he talks with a bearded man wearing a three-cornered hat. When he returns he is smiling.</p>
<p>‘Old Captain Leonghi owes me a favour or two,’ he says, cocking his thumb towards the man. ‘He can’t take you to Suhn but he’ll take you as far as Nhang, and he’s agreed to free passage. It’s a good offer. You’d be mad to try to go south from here on foot—the Koltains are full of bandits. You’d never make it there alive, or at least not completely in one piece.’</p>
<p>You thank Melchar for his help and accept the captain’s offer. He tells you that Leonghi will sail for Nhang in two days’ time. As you have a day free in the city, Melchar invites you to go with him to the Caeno Derby tomorrow. He won two tickets in a dice game last night and he would be pleased to give one of them to you. You accept and agree to meet him here in the taproom for breakfast before leaving for the racetrack.</p>

He denounces you to the others as an agent of the City Council sent to spy on their meeting, and he orders them to attack and slay you. The men react slowly to his frantic commands.

<p>When you and the captain return to the main deck of the <cite>Seasprite</cite>, Ghol-Tabras is little more than a tiny speck shimmering on the far horizon. Your daring leap from the harbour bridge is still the talk of the crew and they are eager to shake your hand when Radyard proudly shows you around his ship. The Siyenese are a friendly crew with a keen sense of humour that they readily share. You enjoy being in their company and the next three days at sea pass effortlessly. On the evening of the fourth day, Radyard drops anchor off the coast at a place called Kastrow’s Door. It is a narrow strait that runs between the jungle mainland and the Isle of Kobra. The night is calm and clear, and the stirrings of a warm southerly breeze promise fine sailing for the following day. Yet despite these good omens you awaken next morning feeling ill at ease. As you are leaving your cabin to go on deck, suddenly you hear the lookout in the crow’s nest shout a warning that chills your blood: ‘Man o’war off the starboard bow!’</p>

On hearing of your encounters at sea he tells you that the buccaneers of Shadaki are renegades from the remnants of a great fleet that was created by the Wytch-king Shasarak. Following the overthrow of their master, these renegades were banished to the wastes of the Sadi Desert by Grey Star—the Wizard Regent of the Free Peoples.

<p>Tolshi the helmsman climbs out of the hatchway to the stern hold and he hurries over to the captain’s side. He reports that the ship is holed below the waterline, close to the rudder, and that she is fast taking in water. Jenkshi inspects the damage for himself and immediately sets his crew to work at patching up the damage. They do their best with the materials available but still <cite>The Azan</cite> continues to take on water.

<p>You voice your fear that Shadakine pirates may already occupy this port, but Jenkshi laughs when he hears this.</p>
<p>‘If you knew Dlash-da Ralzuha like I do, you’d know we have no cause to worry about running foul of any buccaneers there. It’s a slum port. A rubbish dump. Its name means “Junkyard of the Ralzuha” and it certainly lives up to its name.’</p>
<p>Your first glimpse of Dlash-da Ralzuha confirms everything Jenkshi has said about it.

<p>Despite their wretched living conditions, the poverty-stricken tribal natives of Dlash-da Ralzuha give <cite>The Azan</cite> a warm welcome, and they seem genuinely eager to help Jenkshi and his crew with the repair of the ship’s hull. Grooja, the port’s oldest man and tribal leader, provides Jenkshi with fifty native men to help with the unloading of the cargo in order that the damaged section of the hull can be raised above the waterline. The captain sets them to work and he estimates that adequate repairs could be made overnight to enable the ship to sail on the first high tide tomorrow. The crew are pleased to hear this news.

They have come to take you away from the Suhnese and transfer you to a separate cell below ground level. Your destination turns out to be a damp, windowless chamber. It opens onto a torchlit corridor that is lined with rusting stands of armour. At the end of the corridor is a guardroom and, when you pass by this room on your way to the cell, you catch a glimpse of the wooden crate which contains your Weapons and equipment. It is being stored here. You are pushed into your dingy cell, and then the iron door is slammed shut and bolted. As you listen to the footsteps of the guards receding down the corridor, you vow that you will escape from this gaol before the night is over.</p>

<p>You land on your back with a severe jolt that leaves you gasping for breath: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. You have crashed down upon the floor of a cargo hold that is stacked with bales of silk. Above, framed in the open hatchway, you can see the creature getting ready to leap. Quickly you roll away as it drops into the hold, and your speedy action saves you from its deadly talons as maniacally the creature slashes at the floor where, only moments before, you were lying.</p>
<p>Hissing like an angry snake, it leaps after you and lashes out again. This time it rakes its talons along the wooden wall of the hull, barely inches above your head. The tips of these razor-sharp claws become embedded deeply in the timbers and for a few moments the creature is held fast.</p>

<p>At sunset, you follow the elder and a dozen of the village men to a rocky outcrop which overlooks the settlement. They have prepared several hiding places among the rocks where they can lie in wait for the dragon. They are armed with spears and bows, and you note that they have a plentiful supply of arrows. You take cover with the elder and wait patiently for the dragon to arrive. You do not have to wait very long. In the fading light of dusk you see the creature come gliding down from the mountains. The elder tells his men to ready their bows and, as they carry out his order, you see him smile. He seems to be relishing the thought of avenging the damage this creature has caused. The dragon circles above the village and then comes swooping over the outcrop. It is now within arrow range.</p>

<p>Next morning you bid farewell to Tzai and his family before accompanying Chinn to the docks. Moored at a jetty by the old harbour wall is a sleek-prowed merchant trader called the <cite>Vargas</cite> that flies a Suhnese flag. Chinn takes you aboard this vessel and you meet with Gemulkin in his cabin at the stern. He is a wiry man with a hooked nose and close-set eyes that gives him an expression of sly cunning. Yet his voice is deep and resonant and you can tell that he is someone who is used to commanding respect. By way of introduction you present him with the scroll that his cousin gave you, and he smiles as he reads it.</p>
<p>‘If I had a Noble for every favour I’ve done him over the years, I’d be a rich man,’ he says, jokingly. Then he furls the scroll and places it in the drawer of his chart table (erase this item from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>‘Welcome aboard, Journeyman. Pay no attention to my jest. I owe my cousin more favours than I care to remember. You’re welcome to sail with us to Suhn on the noon tide. All I ask is that you work your passage.’</p>
<p>You agree to Gemulkin’s terms and shake his hand to seal the deal. He calls for one of his crew to come and show you to your bunk, but before you go with him you bid farewell to Chinn. He thanks you again, not only for saving his life but also for curing him of his distrust of foreigners.</p>
<p>The <cite>Vargas</cite> sets sail on the noon tide. It is carrying a valuable cargo of silk, and Gemulkin is anxious that it should arrive safely in Suhn. He expects the voyage to last four days. During your first day aboard you help the crew with their duties and listen to their tales about the Sea of Winds. Gemulkin has ordered the crew to be especially vigilant on this voyage, for pirate raiders from northern waters have become more daring of late. The ships of the Freedom Guild patrol the Sea of Winds to deter buccaneers, yet they cannot guarantee safe passage to any ship once it passes beyond Shuri Point.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day the lookout sights Shuri Point in the distance. As the <cite>Vargas</cite> swings around this rocky cape, you see a storm brewing on the horizon. A cluster of black clouds hovers menacingly over the sea, discharging bolts of lightning that arc back and forth between the shore and the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p>You hit the moving deck and your legs crumple beneath you. Badly winded by the fall, you have difficulty in standing and are barely able to rise to your knees. Instinctively, you reach for your weapon. You are feeling vulnerable and are fearful that the crew of this trader may attempt to throw you overboard before you fully recover your senses. Yet to your surprise you hear that they are cheering. Your daring escape from Sesketera’s guards has impressed them immensely.</p>
<p>A tall man with wavy grey hair takes you by the arm and helps you to your feet. He hands you some coins that fell from your Belt Pouch when you hit the deck, and you thank him for his kind assistance.

<p>‘You must o’ ruffled Sesketera’s feathers good and proper for him to ’ave turned ’is guards on you like that,’ he says, with a wry grin. Then he faces his crew and says: ‘Anyone who can achieve that can’t be all bad, eh, lads!’</p>
<p>The crew cheer again. It is plain by their reactions that they are glad to be leaving Ghol-Tabras and its tyrannical ruler. The captain hands over the running of his ship to his bo’sun and then he helps you to his cabin where he pours you a reviving draught of Siyenese ale. This brew has a peculiar grey-green colour but it tastes delicious. You soon learn that you have jumped aboard the <cite>Seasprite</cite>, a Siyenese merchantman under the able command of Captain Radyard. It is carrying a cargo of fine wool and linen and is bound for the port of Masama on a voyage that should take eight days. Radyard had expected to sell half of his cargo in the Ghol-Tabras market, but the heavy mooring charges and the unfriendly mood of the natives there had prompted him to make an early departure. His native homeland—Siyen—has traded with Sommerlund for centuries. Radyard much admires your land and its people and he is happy to allow you to stay on board his ship.

The warden of the hall comes hurrying towards you from the door to an antechamber. He is grumbling and waving his hands frantically as if he is trying to shoo away a cloud of invisible insects. It is clear from his sour expression that he has an intense dislike of the Suhnese.</p>
<p>‘Out! Out! Leave here at once!’ he blusters. You are about to be ejected from the hall when suddenly a guildsman intervenes.

You motion to the crew to follow you but the man raises his hand once more, this time in protest. ‘I will discuss the matter only with you,’ he says.

<p>During the morning of the third day you catch your first sighting of the Port of Suhn and your spirits rise. It sits upon an islet at the mouth of the River Azan, and it is a most welcoming sight. There have been many times during your long voyage south that you feared you might not live to ever see this city.</p>
<p>You continue your trek and enter Suhn by means of a grand wooden bridge. It spans the Azan and leads directly to the harbour. You stop to admire the great harbour gate of Suhn. It is a magnificent arch that is decorated with likenesses of the heads of every ruler this city has known. You count 120 heads in all, the last in the line being that of the city’s present ruler—Grey Star. The harbour is filled with low, wide boats, many with makeshift shelters, that rock gently on the tide. Native families crowd these vessels, their menfolk working long hours at the busy quayside and trading wharves nearby. Passing through the harbour you see several patrols of City Guardsmen who are heavily armed and quick to stop anyone they consider to be suspicious. There is an underlying sense of unease about the place, a tension that reminds you of Nhang. You decide it would be wise to avoid the City Guards and so you leave the harbour and go in search of Lord Zinair, the Dessian ambassador. Beyond the harbour gate you see that there are only two thoroughfares. One leads directly to Suhn’s Market Square and the other, the Avenue of the Southern Seas, wends its way into the city’s trade quarter.</p>

He was an infamous necromancer who inflicted a reign of terror upon this land until finally he was defeated and his empire destroyed in the year MS 5057.</p>

Between rantings, he offers them food from a large wooden bowl.</p>

<p>You reach the ferry station as the vessel is leaving and you are forced to leap from the jetty and cling to its tailgate. The ferryman on the deck of the vessel grabs your hands and helps you to climb aboard. He then asks you to pay the fare of 2 Nobles and your heart sinks when you remember that all your money was stolen during the night. The ferryman becomes impatient; he threatens to have you thrown overboard if you do not stump up the fare. After some arguing he finally agrees to accept one Backpack Item in lieu of cash. (Delete from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> one Backpack Item of your own choosing.)</p>
<p>You settle yourself at the bow rail and look around at your fellow travellers. Most appear to be merchants with wagons and handcarts that are loaded with goods destined for the markets of Tiklu. It is a short voyage of 20 miles across the strait. As the ferry approaches the landing jetty, your fellow passengers get ready to leave. During the disembarkation, one merchant’s small cart is overturned and his cargo is spilled onto the shore. The other merchants push past him, but you feel sorry for his plight and you help to calm his carthorse and retrieve his goods. He is very grateful for your assistance and he offers you a ride to Tiklu aboard his cart which you willingly accept.</p>

<p>You explain the problem to Melchar and he solves it by swiping a pair of lady’s pink pantaloons from a washing line that is strung across the alley. Their furious owner sees him stealing her gaudy garment from her bedroom window, and she hurls a chamber pot at him in a desperate attempt to stop him getting away. Unfortunately, the pot hits you on the back of the head (lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point). As you escape along the winding alleyway, you rub the bruise that is rising on your head and curse your luck. But you are grateful of one thing: at least the chamber pot was empty!</p>
<p>You follow Melchar through the alleyways of the east quarter which take you all the way back to The Song of the Silver Star tavern. The young journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having escaped from Wrok’s henchmen when finally you enter the sanctuary of the inn’s crowded taproom. The innkeeper asks Melchar if he bought his pantaloons with the proceeds of his winnings at the racetrack. He replies that, thanks to your advice, he did not bet. The only thing he lost was his breeches and he proceeds to tell the innkeeper how that came about. The man frowns.</p>
<p>‘Wrok’s not a man to cross, y’know,’ he warns. ‘He’s ruthless when it comes to getting even. I think you two had better stay in the attic tonight. Wrok’s sure to send his lackeys out a-huntin’ for you.’</p>
<p>You heed the innkeeper’s warning and spend the night hidden in his attic room. Before dawn breaks you slip out of the tavern by a back door and say farewell to Melchar in the street outside.</p>

<p>You follow Grooja out of his hut and along a vermin-infested path which wends a tortuous route through a maze of slum dwellings and festering rubbish dumps. After a mile or so, this rough track ascends into a wooded hillside and then ends upon a plateau which overlooks the harbour. From here you can see Jenkshi and his crew working on <cite>The Azan</cite> by the light of a hundred oily torches. With undisguised pride, Grooja points to the Shrine of the Oracle and invites you to avail yourself of its wisdom. The shrine consists of a man-sized statue constructed from rusting metal and chunks of driftwood held together with nails, strips of animal skin, and twisted steel wire. You decide to humour Grooja and so you ask the statue to tell you if there is anyone you should trust or distrust during your long journey to Suhn. As expected, you get no response. But then a wind arises and it makes a faint whistling sound as it passes through the holes in the statue. For a fleeting moment you think you hear the words: ‘<em>Bad…dragon…is good,</em>’ but then the wind dies and there is nothing but silence. Grooja smiles. He seems to think that the oracle has spoken a great truth.</p>

The famous grand mansions of its northern quarter are now little more than dilapidated shells, and its paved avenues are broken and overgrown with weeds. Yet despite its state of neglect and decay, Caeno is a crowded city, especially at this time of the year.</p>
<p>You discover why as you make your way through its twisting, soot-blackened streets. On every other wall there hangs a gaudy yellow poster announcing the Caeno Derby, an annual race that attracts visitors from all over Magnamund. The race is to be run tomorrow and the inns and boarding houses are overflowing with customers. After a long search, you finally discover a shabby inn called The Song of the Silver Star that has a vacant room. The fat innkeeper informs you with glee that bed and board will cost you 6 Nobles, an exorbitant sum for such a run-down establishment.</p>
<p>‘It’s the derby,’ he says, without a hint of an apology. ‘Beds is at a premium with so many visitors around.’</p>

You hold your fire until you have a clear shot at the creature’s eye, which appears to be the only part of its body that is vulnerable to a missile. Your shaft comes close to its mark: it glances off the dragon’s eyelid. The creature seems not to even notice your hit. It circles the village once more and then hovers above the burnt-out remains of the central hut.

On hearing of your encounters at sea he tells you that the buccaneers of Shadaki are renegades from the remnants of a great fleet that was created by the Wytch-king Shasarak. Following the overthrow of their master, these renegades were banished to the wastes of the Sadi Desert by Grey Star—the Wizard Regent of the Free Peoples. However, the buccaneers have recently returned to prey upon the rich sea lanes, and their piracy has grown unchecked ever since Grey Star disappeared three months ago from his palace in the city of Shadaki. His court officials maintain that he is abroad on a quest to western Magnamund, but rumour is rife that he has been abducted by necromancers who wish for a return to the dark days of Shasarak’s rule.</p>
<p>Melchar asks what has brought you to this part of the world and you tell him simply that you are on your way to the Port of Suhn to meet with Lord Zinair of Dessi. On hearing this, Melchar says that he may be able to help you reach your destination.</p>

<p>You whisper the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Sense Evil</i> and your suspicions are immediately confirmed. This man is not trying to help you at all. He is a charlatan, a sly and gifted liar who is trying to lure you into a trap.</p>
<p>Rather than follow him away from the quay, you tell him that you have changed your mind and that you no longer wish to find Captain Radyard. The man curses you under his breath and then he hurries off into an adjoining alleyway. You watch him disappear before you walk across the market square and enquire after Radyard at the Masama Warehouse.</p>

<p>You halt and very slowly lift your hands away from your sides to demonstrate to the Eldenorans that you are not reaching for a weapon. Then you focus on the Eldenoran captain and launch a sharp pulse of psychic Kai energy at his head. He gasps, and then he lets the crewman fall to the taproom floor as the power of your psychic probe burns through his mind like a red-hot dagger.</p>
<p>Fearing that their captain is having some kind of fit, the drunken Eldenorans begin to panic. Some throw their ale into his face to revive him, while others struggle to lift his heavy body onto a cluttered table. When one man slices open the captain’s close-fitting leather jerkin with his dagger, so as to help him breathe, another thinks that he is attacking his master. He punches him unconscious and suddenly a fist-fight erupts. During the commotion, you indicate to the Suhnese that now would be a good time to leave. Without a word they rise from their tables and move towards the door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade as they make a hasty exit from the tavern. Once outside, the Suhnese can afford to laugh at the incredible stupidity of the Eldenorans. It is hollow laughter, but at least it helps them to relieve the frustration of having to return early to <cite>The Azan</cite>.</p>

<p>Using your advanced camouflage skills, you draw your Kai cloak tightly around yourself and stand close to the wall of the hut. Then you scream long and loud, as if in great pain, and wait for the guards to come. The door opens and two natives armed with spears step through into the gloomy interior. They fail to see you where you are and immediately assume that you have escaped. As they leave the hut to raise the alarm, you are able to slip out through the open door.</p>

You urge Gemulkin to turn his ship about for the fury of this unnatural storm is churning the sea, making it boil and seethe. Fearing for the safety of his cargo and crew the captain readily agrees and he orders his helmsman to bring the ship around. But as the <cite>Vargas</cite> returns towards Shuri Point, Gemulkin suddenly sees something on the horizon that makes him change his mind.</p>

<p>You shout to your companions to make a run for the harbour and then you lead the way along the shadowy streets. The clumping sound of booted feet and the blare of a brass horn echo among the surrounding houses as the city watch raise the alarm and give chase. Swiftly you and the crew outrun these armoured guards but, to your dismay, when you reach the harbour gate you discover that it is closed and bolted.</p>

<p>You leap over the bodies of the henchmen and follow Melchar as he leads you back through the streets of Caeno to The Song of the Silver Star tavern. When finally you enter the sanctuary of its crowded taproom, the young journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having escaped from the racetrack alive. The innkeeper asks Melchar if his happy mood is due to a win at the derby. He says that, thanks to your advice, he did not bet and therefore he did not lose. He also adds the real reason why he is feeling elated, and the innkeeper frowns.</p>
<p>‘Wrok’s not a man to cross,’ he warns. ‘He’s ruthless when it comes to getting even. I think you two had better stay in the attic tonight. Wrok’s sure to send his lackeys out a-huntin’ for you.’</p>
<p>You heed the innkeeper’s warning and spend the night hidden in his attic room. Before dawn breaks you slip out of the tavern by a back door and say farewell to Melchar in the street outside.</p>
<p>‘Captain Leonghi’s ship is moored down at the docks,’ he says. ‘It’s called <cite>Embassage</cite>. I wish you a swift and safe journey to Nhang, Grand Master. I’ll always remember our little adventure at the Caeno Derby and I hope we’ll meet again one day when you return to Sommerlund.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you can tell me what you make of this, captain,’ you say, as you retrieve the Siyen Crown from your Backpack. ‘It was found some weeks ago in a wreck off the coast of Vassagonia.’</p>
<p>Radyard takes the silver crown and he inspects it carefully. He smiles when he discovers a Siyenese inscription engraved along its inner rim.</p>
<p>‘It’s the crown of a princess,’ he says. ‘Not a state crown, mark you, but one that she would have worn while carrying out her daily duties. The inscription shows that it comes from the royal household of Oridon. It’s more than a century old and I’d say it’s likely that it belonged to Princess Fahra. She was lost at sea. It’s not worth a great fortune but it would have some historical value, especially in my homeland.’</p>
<p>‘In that case, captain,’ you say, ‘you are welcome to keep it…in return for my passage to Masama.’</p>

<p>Fair weather returns and <cite>The Azan</cite> makes good speed as it crosses the jade-green waters of the Gulf of Tentarium. It is shortly before noon of the following day when the first glimpse of Zharloum is sighted by the lookout, and less than an hour later you find yourself sailing into the harbour of this grand city. Emerald pennants flutter from its towers and the roofs of its sun-bleached houses, and crowds of industrious citizens throng its paved avenues and alleyways. This old Shadakine port has a long history of free and fair trading. It is many miles from the cities of Shadakine political power which lie to the south, and due to this fortunate fact it has been spared much of the damage inflicted upon this troubled land by a succession of ruthless and tyrannical rulers.</p>
<p>The ship enters and docks at the harbour wall, close to the jetty of a warehouse which contains the iron and copper ingots that it will carry to Suhn. As the crew begin the task of loading the cargo aboard, you agree to help Gregor find the Lourdenian Consulate so that he may report the attack upon his ship, and seek their help in returning home.</p>
<p>Together you disembark from <cite>The Azan</cite> and follow a cobblestoned road which leads out of the harbour and into the heart of the city. When asked for directions, a helpful trader tells Gregor that the Lourdenian Consulate building lies at the far end of this busy main street. He gives the smiling man a Gold Crown and then you continue your way along this crowded thoroughfare. Gregor wishes to reach his Consulate but he is in no great hurry. He suggests that perhaps you and he could first pay a visit to one of the many colourful inns or famous emporia which line this teeming main street.</p>

He leads you into an alley and moments later your fears are confirmed when you find yourself surrounded by six knife-wielding thugs.

Here in a formal ceremony you receive the thanks and praise of Acarya—the leader of the Shianti exiles. Solemnly he vows to deliver the Moonstone into the hands of Goddess Ishir herself, thereby ensuring that never again will its powers disrupt Magnamund’s delicate balance of nature, nor be misused by the forces of Evil.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the Shianti show you some of the magical wonders of their island that have never before been seen by Man. You marvel at flowing rivers of jewels, fabulous flora, and species of exotic fauna that defy description. After your tour of this paradise isle you are allowed to rest awhile before you are escorted to your boat to begin your journey back to the Port of Suhn.</p>
<p>Your return voyage across the Sea of Dreams is swift and eerily smooth. You sense that your direction and speed are being controlled by the Shianti, for within minutes of casting off from the shores of Lorn, the bustling harbour entrance to the Port of Suhn suddenly appears from out of the swirling sea mist. A stiff breeze catches your sail and propels you towards the quayside where, to your astonishment, Lord Zinair is waiting to greet your valiant return.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. Once more you have proved your courage and resourcefulness. You have completed the quest entrusted to you by Lone Wolf and you have triumphed magnificently. The safe return of the Moonstone to the Shianti is a major victory in the war against Evil, but it is a war that is still yet to be won. Upon your return to the Port of Suhn you learn from Lord Zinair of a new and sinister threat to the fragile peace of your world. If you wish to confront this deadly threat and prove that you are truly a champion of the New Order Kai, then the nature of the challenge can be found in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure, entitled:</p>

<h4><a name="lic-1-5">1.5</a></h4>

<p>‘Licensee’ shall hereafter refer to any person or electronic agent who receives some portion or all of the Internet Editions. The ‘Licensee’ shall hereinafter be referred to as ‘Licensee’ or ‘you’.</p>

<h3><a name="lic-2">2. Terms of Distribution</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-2-0">2.0</a></h4>

<h4><a name="lic-2-1">2.1</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document. Indeed, you have no right to receive or view a copy or copies without first accepting this License as legally valid and binding and agreeing to the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>
<p>Redistribution includes but is not limited to displaying the Internet Editions within the graphical representation of an Internet site other than the Distribution Point. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the use of HTML ‘frames’.</p>
<p>An exception to the restrictions on redistribution in this section is made in that you may send the Internet Editions or derivative works thereof to the Distribution Point by the consent of the Maintainer.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-4">2.3</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators retain all other rights to their respective portions of the Internet Editions not covered by this License.

<h4><a name="lic-2-5">2.4</a></h4>

<p>If a person is under the legal age to be able to enter into a contractual relationship as defined by the laws of the area in which that person resides, they may have a parent or legal guardian agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License. On condition of agreeing to be bound by the terms of the License, that same parent or legal guardian may thereafter give a copy or copies of the Internet Editions to that child. That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

<p>If any of the Authors or the Illustrators revokes your rights granted under this License, you agree to destroy all copies of the Authors’ or Illustrators’ work which is a part of the Internet Editions of which you have control within fourteen calendar days of receiving notification in any form.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-4">4. Jurisdiction</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-4-0">4.0</a></h4>

<p>If, in consequence of court judgement or the laws of a particular area, any portion of the License is held as invalid or unenforceable in any particular circumstance, you are no longer granted any rights under the terms of this License in that circumstance. You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-5">5. Revision of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-5-0">5.0</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and the Illustrators may publish revisions of this License in the future to address new concerns. Any further revisions will be legally binding at the time that you receive notification in any form of the revision.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

<h4><a name="lic-6-1">6.1</a></h4>

<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR MAINTAINER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE INTERNET EDITIONS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE INTERNET EDITIONS TO OPERATE WITH ANY PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
