 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>Evil Lord Vandyan of Eldenora has unearthed the lost secrets of rune magics used by Agarash the Damned during his ancient conquest of Magnamund. Empowered by his discoveries, Vandyan unleashes his armies upon the peaceful realms of the Free Alliance with swift and devastating effect. Lone Wolf, Supreme Master of the Kai, leads the crusade to defeat Vandyan before all Magnamund succumbs to his tyrannical rule.</p>

   <p>In <strong><cite>Rune War</cite></strong>, your task is to infiltrate Skull-Tor, Lord Vandyan’s stronghold, and destroy the ancient runes from which he draws his evil power. Can you succeed in your vital mission…or will you fall foul of the traps and terrors that guard the warlord’s mighty fortress?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai—the warrior élite of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>It is the year MS 5083, thirty-three years after the First Order of the Kai was almost wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. Lone Wolf, the leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the sole survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS 5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>
<p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>
<p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS 5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>
<p>In the year MS 5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf’s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King’s Army of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>During the six years that have elapsed since the defeat of his minions, Naar has endeavoured to enact his vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and quietly they wait in the shadows for the day when they can serve their fell master. One such agent was Baron Sadanzo of Siyen. The Kingdom of Siyen is one of the richest countries in the continent of Southern Magnamund, and it is also one of Sommerlund’s oldest allies. Sadanzo had its ruler, King Oridon, brutally assassinated so that he could lay claim to the throne in the absence of Prince Karvas, Oridon’s only son, who lived in exile upon the remote Isle of Sheasu. The Baron was a disciple of Naar and he possessed a sorcerous power that had turned the minds of the Siyenese Court to his will. By use of sorcery he made them support his ascendance to the throne. It was a dangerous threat to Siyen, yet all was not lost. The constitution of Siyen decreed that Prince Karvas had, upon the death of his father, 60 days in which to lay claim to his rightful heritage. Only if he failed to return in time would Sadanzo be elected the new King.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf promised to prevent Baron Sadanzo from usurping the throne, but it was a pledge that only you could fulfil. At the time of King Oridon’s assassination, you were engaged upon a mission in Southern Magnamund and were closer to the Isle of Sheasu than any other Kai. Upon successful completion of your mission, Lone Wolf ordered you to forgo your return to the Kai Monastery and journey instead to Sheasu to seek out the exiled Prince. Your new mission was to find Karvas and escort him safely home in time to claim his throne and thwart Sadanzo’s plan. Despite great adversity you succeeded; Prince Karvas was duly elected King and the evil Baron Sadanzo and his followers were put to the sword. In recognition of your courage and your invaluable help in saving his realm from Sadanzo’s tyranny, the newly-crowned King Karvas made you an honourable Knight of Siyen. He also placed <cite>Golden Star</cite>, his royal sailing ship, at your disposal to help speed your return home to Holmgard—the Sommlending capital.</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn on a cool mid-autumn morning, the sleek royal Siyenese clipper glided into Holmgard harbour. Despite the early hour, an escort of the King’s Guard were standing by in readiness to convey you by carriage directly to the Kai Monastery where you were greeted and warmly congratulated by your fellow Grand Masters. You also received glowing praise from Supreme Master Lone Wolf for successfully completing your missions and for upholding the finest traditions of the Kai. It felt good to be home after so many months abroad and you were looking forward to settling back into the routine of the monastery. But your hopes were soon dashed when, later that day, you were summoned by Lone Wolf to a private audience with him in his chambers. The news he had to impart came as an unexpected shock.</p>
<p>‘We must prepare for a crusade, Grand Master,’ he said, as he unfurled a large vellum <a href="#map">map of central Magnamund</a> and spread it upon the granite floor of his vaulted chamber. ‘War rages anew in the Stornlands, and its ravenous flames threaten to devour our allies within the Freeland Alliance.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf unsheathed his mighty sword—Sommerswerd—and, using the tip of its golden blade, he pointed to a landlocked realm west of the great River Storn. ‘This is Eldenora, the source of the problems we must face. Since the fall of its former ruler, Prince Lutha, a new lordling has arisen to snatch the reins of this lawless realm. He is not of noble birth, yet he has crushed all royal opposition and taken upon himself the title Lord Vandyan of Eldenora. Earlier this year he swelled the ranks of his army with regiments of Magadorian and Ogian mercenaries. After having falsely accused his peaceful neighbour—Delden—of violating Eldenoran territory, he stationed these mercenaries along his northern border. When Delden mustered its army to counter the threat, Vandyan accused them of aggression and promptly declared war. The campaign was swift and brutal; Delden’s army was broken in battle and its people are now enslaved by this tyrant. Emboldened by his martial success, Vandyan carried the war further afield. Magador, its defences already weakened by the defection to Eldenora of its best mercenary regiments, was the next to crumble. By mid-summer Vandyan’s army had crossed the River Storn and captured Salony. Word reached us from neighbouring Lyris that a steady stream of fresh troops were arriving from Eldenora to bolster the ranks of its occupying armies. Clearly Lyris, with its ancient city of Varetta, was the next jewel to be added to Vandyan’s shameful crown of conquest.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf interrupted the briefing to open a door to an adjoining antechamber, and through this doorway shuffled an old man clad in a hooded robe of dyed brown linen. ‘May I introduce you to Gwynian the Sage,’ said Lone Wolf, reverently. ‘He has travelled from Varetta to seek our aid.’</p>
<p>The name Gwynian was well known to you, for this wise sage had helped Lone Wolf on many occasions in the past and his name was revered by the Kai. But this was the first time you had met him in person and you felt greatly honoured. In turn, Gwynian praised you for the victories you had achieved since becoming a Kai Grand Master. Upon Lone Wolf’s invitation, he approached the map and took over the briefing.</p>
<p>‘Since my arrival here, sadly I have learned that my beloved city of Varetta is besieged by Vandyan’s horde,’ he said, with quiet solemnity. ‘Lone Wolf has already told you that the Eldenorans are receiving a constant supply of reinforcements. This fact alone would be of grave concern, but it is the nature of these troops that disturbs us more. They are neither human nor mercenaries. They are Vorka, a fighting breed of Agarashi that became extinct following the destruction of their master—Agarash the Damned—several millennia ago…or so we had believed. Now the Vorka have reappeared in great numbers. They are armed, trained, and utterly subservient to the commands of Lord Vandyan.’</p>
<p>As Gwynian continued the briefing, you learned that the war had escalated greatly since the arrival of the Vorka. To the south, Eldenoran armies had seized the city of Tekaro and were marching across the Slovarian Plain, driving the battle-weary Slovians before them. To the west, Vandyan’s armies had invaded Palmyrion and were within reach of Vanamor, the capital. Lone Wolf informed you that Guildmaster Banedon had travelled to Palmyrion by skyship to assist its ruler, Elector Manatine, muster his country’s defences. With his help the Palmyrions were holding the enemy at bay, but with hundreds of Vorka reinforcements arriving unchecked, it was simply a matter of time before Vanamor would be overrun.</p>
<p>‘The Vorka are the key to Vandyan’s military successes,’ said Lone Wolf. ‘If we are to defeat him and save our allies, then we must cut off his reinforcements at the source.’</p>
<p>‘This is so,’ replied Gwynian, ‘and we do know from where the Vorka have sprung.’ The sage stooped and pointed with a gnarled finger at the middle of the vellum map. ‘Our agents have reported they come from here…Duadon. It is the Eldenoran capital. Thousands of Vorka have been observed marching out from this walled city to bolster Vandyan’s armies in the field, yet no Vorka have ever been seen entering the city from elsewhere. This can mean but one thing: the Vorka horde is being created somewhere within Duadon itself.’</p>
<p>‘But how?’ you asked, incredulously. ‘Is Vandyan a great sorcerer?’</p>
<p>‘No, he is not a sorcerer, great or otherwise,’ replied Gwynian, knowingly. ‘But he has discovered an ancient force that was thought to be lost forever. There is only one power in Magnamund capable of creating the Vorka: the power of the runes. Vandyan has discovered the lost Runes of Agarash the Damned.’</p>
<p>Gwynian told of how, millennia ago, Agarash the Damned had battled with the Elder Magi in a war that had lasted for more than a thousand years. Nearing the end of this epic confrontation, as his vitality waned against the goodly magic of the Elder Magi, the evil Agarash encapsulated the essence of his remaining powers into tablets of obsidian and crystals of jet. Agarash knew that he was doomed, but if he were able to preserve some of his powers in this way, so that they could be used by future disciples of Naar upon Magnamund, then the legacy of his terrible rule would survive beyond him. Three obsidian tablets were engraved with marks, or runes, to distinguish their fell origin, while a further seven crystals were fashioned into likenesses of the Kai Lorestones and called Doomstones in mockery of those goodly gems of power.</p>
<p>‘Since the demise of Agarash, some of the Doomstones have surfaced to ensnare and empower Naar’s lowly agents,’ said Gwynian. ‘But the Doomstones cannot create Vorka. Only the runes hold this power. It has long been believed that they perished with Agarash himself in the destruction of Naaros, his legendary stronghold. Now, it seems, they have finally surfaced once more…and have fallen into the hands of Lord Vandyan.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf vowed that he would help Gwynian raise the siege of Varetta and secure for him the freedom of Lyris. The New Order Kai were told to prepare for a crusade against Eldenora, and valuable help was provided by High-Mayor Kordas of Casiorn. At his own expense, this rich merchant ruler raised an army of mercenaries in Anari, Firalond, and Kakush, and he sent them to the town of Quarlen to prevent the enemy from crossing the River Quarl. These mercenaries are skilled soldiers and have been paid handsomely, but they lack gifted leaders. It was agreed that the Kai would provide this leadership, with Kai Grand Masters and lesser ranks assuming command of mercenary regiments upon their arrival in Quarlen.</p>
<p>‘Three days hence, we begin the ride to Quarlen,’ said Lone Wolf. ‘Armed with our knowledge, our courage, and our Disciplines, I vow we Kai shall turn back the tide of evil that now threatens to consume our allies.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>) and physical stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 32). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21–23), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to this adventure.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>
<h3><a name="kainame">Your Kai Name</a></h3>

<p>It has long been the tradition of your élite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year’s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
<p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

<h4><a name="nodispln">New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines</a></h4>

<p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor—Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf—you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>
<p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which you begin the <cite>New Order</cite> series, means that you are skilled in the use of <em>one</em> of the weapons listed below.</p>
<p>For every adventure that you complete successfully in the <cite>New Order</cite> series while possessing the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery, you will gain proficiency with one additional weapon.</p>

For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (Kai-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously).

<h5><a name="astrolgy">Astrology</a></h5>

<p>The celestial bodies which occupy the skies above Magnamund have long been known to affect the lives of its inhabitants. Mastery of this Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to predict and shape the future by studying the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the myriad planets and stars.

<h4><a name="kaiweapn">Kai Weapons</a></h4>

<p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the élite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>
<p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a href="#action">Special Items List</a>.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe ‘Alema’.</p>
<p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you were to use ‘Alema’ in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of +7 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> would remain at +5.</p>

<h4><a name="howuse">Equipment—How to use it</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct Weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this Weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful Weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is best to equip yourself also with a close combat Weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is 12.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai Weapon</dt>
<dd>Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal Weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This is in addition to the bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your five Disciplines, then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of the Stornlands is the Gold Crown. These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.<br /><br />

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
You, Grand Master (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. You also possess the Kai Weapon ‘Ulnarias’, so you add an additional 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This gives you a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 45.<br /><br />
You now subtract the Wild Dogs’ <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45−31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself—Grand Master.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>You (GM) lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
<li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of New Order Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>New Order</cite> series, you will gain an additional Grand Master Discipline and progress towards the pinnacle of Kai perfection—to become a Kai Supreme Master.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>

<dd>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this skill are able to predict the weather accurately for the forthcoming 3 hours. The range of this ability is an area 10 square miles around the Kai Grand Sentinel. Duration and range steadily increase as a Kai Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Astrology</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to detect psychic residues left on an object by its owner.

<dd>By use of this Discipline, a Kai Grand Defender is able to locate a known or familiar material object. Initially the range of this ability is limited to a 15-foot radius, however this distance steadily increases as a Kai Grand Master advances in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Astrology</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Defenders who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all common astrological devices used to predict future events. Such devices include cards, dice, and crystal spheres.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Herbmastery</dt>

</dd>
<dt>Elementalism</dt>
<dd>By using this Discipline, Kai Grand Defenders are able to summon up a dense, misty vapour to obscure themselves from both normal vision and infravision (night sight).

<dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Defenders who possess this Discipline are able to use their musical skills to pacify (and/or implant a suggestion into the mind of) an intelligent creature within audible range.

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">New Order Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>You are about to embark upon a crusade against Lord Vandyan of Eldenora, a cruel tyrant who draws his power from runes created long ago by Agarash the Damned—the first champion of the Dark God Naar. The evil power of these ancient stones must be destroyed, and quickly, if Vandyan is to be prevented from enslaving the free kingdoms of Northern Magnamund.</p>
<p>During your quest, some of the material items that you will encounter will be of use to you, yet others may be red herrings of no real value at all.

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>Lone Wolf’s announcement that the Kai must prepare for a crusade in the Stornlands galvanizes the monastery into a frenzy of activity. Eagerly the members of the New Order set about their duties, and the preparations for the march to Quarlen are completed within two days as planned. On the morning of the third day, the Kai assemble in the training park in full battle-dress. A deathly hush descends upon the gathering as every Kai Lord, from lowly initiate to Grand Master, listens with trepidation as Lone Wolf reads aloud a list of names. One in five of all those present must stay to defend the monastery, and Lone Wolf’s list contains the names of the one hundred Kai he has chosen to remain behind. As each of these warriors is called, so they leave the assembled ranks to take up guard positions on the battlements and towers. Graciously they accept their lot, though none are glad to have been chosen.</p>
<p>The march begins shortly before noon. Lone Wolf rides at the head of the column, in the company of nine who comprise yourself, your four fellow Grand Masters, Gwynian the Sage, and a trio of Kai Mentoras who proudly hold aloft the battle-banners of the Kai, the Royal Arms of Sommerlund, and (in Gwynian’s honour) a scarlet standard bearing the crossed swords of Varetta. The long ride south offers many Sommlending a rare opportunity to see the Kai travelling together in battle-order. Word of your coming spreads quickly through towns and villages that lie on your route, and hundreds turn out to wave and cheer as you pass.</p>
<p>Favoured by cool dry weather, the column makes swift progress as it crosses the Southlund Marches and enters the remote province of Ruanon. Within a week you have reached Casiorn, the City of Merchants, where fresh provisions and a comfortable billet are provided by High-Mayor Kordas. Lone Wolf learns from Kordas that Vandyan’s armies have now seized control of Lyris and are grouping along the River Quarl in preparation to push east towards Casiorn itself. Kordas’ mercenaries are holding a defensive line along the river’s east bank, having destroyed all the bridges at Quarlen to hinder the enemy’s advance. Their commander, Lord Nathuro of Anari, is keenly awaiting the arrival of the Kai. Less encouraging is the news from Varetta. The city has endured a cruel and relentless bombardment from Vandyan’s hordes and has suffered many casualties, yet its ancient walls still stand and stoically its citizens are keeping the besieging enemy at bay. The news that Varetta has not fallen raises Gwynian’s spirits, but few, including the sage himself, expect the city to survive unaided for much longer.</p>
<p>The column departs from Casiorn early the following day and rides due west towards Quarlen. For four days you follow the highway towards your destination and, with each passing day, so the number of refugees that you encounter steadily increases. Most are Lyrisian, but there are also Deldenian and Salonese among their numbers. Forced out of their homes by the war, they have salvaged what few possessions they can carry and have crossed the River Quarl. Now they are settled in tented encampments all along the fertile valley which separates the Slovarian and Quarlen mountains.</p>
<p>‘Regard these people well,’ commands Lone Wolf, as the column rides past their makeshift settlements, ‘and remember that their survival, and the survival of thousands like them, depends upon the swift success of our crusade.’</p>

<p>Beyond the archway you discover a long ramp. It descends to the floor of a huge chamber, recently constructed, which is filled with oppressive heat and noise. More than a dozen passages lead away from this domed hall and most are illuminated by the fearsome orange glow of furnace fires. Your Kai senses tell you that these passages lead to Vandyan’s armouries that are situated on the east side of Skull-Tor.

<p>The night passes without incident and you awaken at dawn to the shrill sound of bird song. Through the thinning canopy of autumn leaves you can see a forest track which runs parallel to the river. A distant flicker of movement catches your eye and, when you magnify your vision, you see three riders approaching from the south. Two are armed and they wear the uniforms of Eldenoran cavalry scouts, but the third is clad in a tunic of scarlet and black—the colours of the Slovian army. His hands are tied and you suspect that he is a prisoner of war. The loss of your sailboat threatens to delay your journey downriver to Tekaro by several days. Mindful of this, you decide to set an ambush for the approaching Eldenoran riders to capture their horses.</p>
<p>From the cover of the trees that border upon the track, you wait until the riders are close and then you draw upon your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to command their horses to stop. They slow to a halt and, despite their riders’ stinging blows, they refuse to take a step further. Silently you unsheathe your Kai Weapon.

<p>‘Vandyan is out for revenge,’ says Delissa, as she hurries to her bookcase. ‘He must have sent every guard in the city out hunting for you this night.’ She opens the secret compartment that contains the plans of Skull-Tor, and removes a clear crystal sphere that lies beneath them. You recognize that this sphere is a seeing stone, for Gwynian possesses one that is identical. It is through the use of these seeing stones that he has maintained contact with his agents in Duadon. Delissa places the stone on a table and she recites the arcane words which activate it. A milky mist swirls at its core and then rapidly it dissipates to reveal Gwynian’s smiling face.</p>
<p>The wise sage congratulates you for the success of your mission. He tells you that the Vorka have been destroyed and the Eldenoran armies are retreating on every front. He is saddened to hear of Hulsta’s death and he consoles Delissa with the promise that her husband will be remembered and revered as a hero in the years to come. She is heartened by his kind words and she reaffirms her vow to help keep you safe until you are able to return to your homeland.</p>
<p>Gwynian informs you both that a rendezvous has been arranged to take place at dusk in three days’ time. You are to meet with Guildmaster Banedon aboard his flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> at a place called ‘Xaitar’s Rock’. It is a landmark located in the hills 10 miles to the north of Duadon, close to the Luyen road. Delissa says that she knows it well.</p>
<p>‘Banedon will take you to Varetta where we shall meet again soon at the Halls of Learning,’ says the sage. ‘But until that glorious day, you must remain vigilant. You have dealt Vandyan a mortal blow. Now that his days are numbered, he will do everything in his power to avenge the destruction of the runes. Be warned, Grand Master.

<p>Silently you advance along the dark mine shaft until you see the flicker of candlelight playing upon the rough-hewn walls. The light comes from a cave-like chamber excavated from the tunnel wall. You inch your way nearer, and when you peer around its corner, you see the three Eldenoran soldiers whom you overheard earlier. They sit on a sheet of canvas and are sharing a meal of cold cooked meat and ale. Behind them you see a small wire-haired dog asleep atop a pile of loot that glitters in the light of a solitary candle. The men are fantasizing about how they intend to spend the riches they have looted from Tekaro once the war is over.

<p>The Vorka rush through the trees, but they arrive too late to share in the unexpected feast and they proceed to vent their frustrations on the boat itself. You are taken aback by the sheer speed and ferocity of their attack which reduces your sailboat to matchwood. Silently you watch as they go back to the bridge and cross once more to the other side of the river.

It leads to a shaft where you descend by slope and stair to what appears, at first, to be a dead end. However, your Kai Sixth Sense quickly determines that the seemingly blank walls at the base of the shaft conceal a secret door. You detect a lever near the floor, and when you push it down, a section of the wall slides open to reveal a curtained arch. The voices are louder now and you approach the arch with caution. You are about to reach out and grasp the velvet curtains, when an unexpected noise at your back makes you wince. The secret door has closed and locked behind you. Fearful of what may lie ahead, yet unable now to retrace your steps, you peek through a gap in the curtains and your pulse races when you catch your first glimpse of what lies beyond.</p>

<p>‘Drag him down!’ growls the sergeant, and two of his men discard their spears and rush forward to carry out his order. You snatch back on your horse’s reins and he rears up, kicking hard, his forelegs connecting with the soldiers’ chests to send them sprawling in the dirt. Their comrades are startled by your rearing horse and they back off in confusion, giving you space in which to turn him about and gallop away into a nearby alley. As you race along this deserted passageway, you glance over your shoulder and see that the reeves have recovered and they are now pursuing you. The alley turns to the right and comes to a dead end. Facing you is a three-storey townhouse with a balcony which overhangs a pair of stable doors. The lock is broken and so you pull open a door and urge your horse to enter the gloomy interior. Quickly you dismount in the darkness and wedge the doors shut with the shaft of a hammer you find discarded on the straw-covered ground. Moments later you hear the echoing footfalls of the reeves as they come running around the corner. Their sergeant orders them to check the entrance of every house bordering the <i xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>. Two soldiers approach and the stable doors rattle when they push against them with the butts of their spears. You wait with bated breath, fearing they will try to force them open, but they are satisfied that the doors must be bolted from the inside and they move on to check the next house. After a few minutes you hear the soldiers leaving the square.

You recall Hulsta speaking about this keep shortly before his untimely death and, when you focus your Kai senses upon its imposing walls, you detect that it harbours the evil power that you have come to destroy. From the cover of the antechamber, you observe the keep and determine that entry to it can only be gained via a drawbridge which gives access to an archway located 20 feet above the ground. To reach this bridge, you will have to ascend to the next level of Skull-Tor.

<p>‘Where’s Gragov?’ asks a guard, as you set the tray down on a small table beside the door.</p>

<p>You intone the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Sense Evil</i> and at once your mind is flooded with terrible images. Beneath the soil of this clearing lie the bodies of a thousand Slovian prisoners of war. Captured when Tekaro fell, they were brought here by Eldenoran guards and murdered by the merciless Vorka. This clearing is the site of their mass grave and you can detect a strong psychic presence. Mostly it comprises a lingering residue formed by the souls of the innocent men who were murdered here, but there is also something else—something invisible yet wholly evil. Your heart pounds when you suddenly realize that an evil entity has come here to feed upon the psychic remains of the slain Slovian prisoners. You sense it poses a grave and immediate threat to your life, and hurriedly you turn and run through the trees in your haste to escape its clutches.</p>

<p>The soldier hurls his rock and it smashes into the planking near your feet. It tears a hole in the bottom of the boat and a spout of water gushes into the air to rain down upon your canvas cover. The Eldenorans cheer as your boat begins to founder, and as it disappears from view beneath the centre arch, you hear their echoing footfalls as they rush across to the opposite side of the bridge to wait for it to reappear.</p>
<p>When you emerge the Eldenorans give a cheer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must abandon the boat. You turn the rudder towards the left bank and aim your sinking craft at a place where willow trees overhang the river. As you pass beneath their branches, you clamber out and quickly take cover among the trees.</p>
<p>The Eldenorans soon arrive to inspect their handiwork. Silently you observe them as they drag the half-submerged boat out of the water and sift through its meagre contents. They soon tire of this and return to their duties. When the coast is clear, you leave the trees and hurry away from the bridge. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans, you stop to rest for a few hours in the bough of an oak.</p>

It is a slow and laborious task but you persevere and, within the hour, you manage to dislodge three of the iron bars.

<p>Aided by your Sixth Sense, you hear the third tumbler click into position.<sup><a href="#sect40-1-foot" name="sect40-1">5</a></sup> There is a soft whirring sound, and then the door swings open to reveal a vaulted corridor which leads to a flight of iron steps. You enter, and the great door swings shut behind you. There is a junction halfway along the corridor where another passage crosses from left to right. You hurry across and climb the metal steps, but as you are approaching the top of the stairs, you catch a glimpse of two armoured guards beyond. They are standing to attention before a large door that is engraved with mystic symbols. You feel a strong concentration of evil here and, at once, you sense that the Runes of Agarash lie on the other side of this door. Instinctively you duck below the guards’ line of sight, and then quietly you retreat to the junction.</p>
<p>Here you detect the sound of footsteps approaching, and when you spin around to face them, you see a young kitchen attendant walking along the passageway towards you. He is carrying a tray laden with food and he stops abruptly when he sees you suddenly appear. Fearful that he may raise the alarm, you stride towards him and say in an accusing tone: ‘Why are you late, boy? Lord Vandyan has been kept waiting more than an hour for his food!’</p>
<p>‘But…but this is not for his lordship,’ answers the young man, clearly confused by your rebuke. ‘It’s for the guards at the door to the Rune Hall.’</p>
<p>‘What!’ you reply, feigning outrage. ‘You mean to say that you would put the feeding of two lowly guards before our master’s needs! This is intolerable!’</p>
<p>‘No…no…I mean, I was told by the cook to take this tray to the guards. Lord Vandyan ate a meal in his chambers some three hours ago. I’ve had no order to take him food since.’</p>
<p>‘Well, our master is hungry,’ you reply, ‘and you’d better go back to the kitchen and find him something suitable to eat this instant…if you value your hide, that is!’</p>
<p>Forcefully you snatch the tray from the bemused assistant, saying: ‘Go tell cook to prepare him something substantial, understand? He’s very hungry. I’ll deliver these scraps to the guards myself.’ The confused young assistant scratches his head and then he hurries away to deliver your order to the cook. You watch him until he turns a distant corner, and then you look down at the tray of cold meat and vegetables and an idea takes shape, an idea that may help you gain entry to the Rune Hall.</p>

<p>‘I’ve found him!’ he bellows, and six guardsmen who are searching the yard come racing up the stairs with their swords drawn. You fight bravely and slay them all, but the word of your whereabouts quickly spreads and within minutes you are cornered in the cooperage by more than a hundred of Vandyan’s troops. Their leader has placed a bounty of 10,000 Gold Crowns upon your head, payable upon delivery of your body to Skull-Tor, dead or alive. Spurred on by the promise of this huge reward, his troops attack you repeatedly until you are finally overwhelmed by the sheer weight of numbers.</p>
<p>You may take some comfort in the fact that you fulfilled your vital mission. By destroying the Runes of Agarash you have saved Magnamund from the tyrannical rule of Vandyan. It is a great victory, but one that you have paid for with your life.</p>

<p>You strike the rune a mighty blow that explodes it into a thousand fiery shards. At once there is a screeching cacophony of noise and the platform bucks like a wild stallion as the evil power of the rune is sucked out of the hall and into the heart of the raging storm. Desperately you cling to the floor as seething rays of electrical fire dance around the edges of the aperture and arc back and forth between the ceiling and the hall below. Then a ghastly shriek echoes above the deafening noise as the approaching Vaag are consumed by fire and lightning. As their dying cries fade, so the storm abates, and you are able to stagger to your feet and take hold of the parapet rail with both hands.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration III]</div>
<p>Gasping for breath in the dust-choked air, you look down and see a patrol of Eldenoran guardsmen come rushing through the door.

<p>‘Very well, I’ll pay what you ask,’ you reply. Quickly the guards wave the wagon through into the city and then they lower the portcullis and order the following traffic to wait while they escort you to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they are going to renege on their deal and throw you in a cell regardless, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: ‘Don’t worry, friend. We’ll jus’ go somewhere private. We don’t want all o’ Duadon to know our business.’</p>
<p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall. You hand over the 10 Gold Crowns (erase these from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) and the guards unlock the door. It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city’s south wall. ‘Off y’go, trooper,’ says the tall guard, as he pushes you through the arched doorway.</p>
<p>The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. You leave the door and walk along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed. They trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan’s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
<p>You recall Gwynian’s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city’s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that is heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you are about to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square to the east and west.

Moments later, a troop of guards emerges from the doorway opposite the bridge. They are the same soldiers who, only a few minutes earlier, escorted away the unfortunate herald whose map and wristband you stole.</p>

Quickly he explains that, despite your uniform, you are not an Eldenoran. When he then reveals that you are a Kai Lord on a secret mission, their eyes widen with awe. Prizo warns you that there are many Eldenorans in this area and that it is no longer a safe place. He invites you both to stay here this night but he says you must remain watchful. Reluctantly Prizo and his wife have decided to leave their home. They plan to cross the Quarl and seek shelter in Salony.

Rouf has decided to join his aunt and uncle and go with them to Salony. You tell them that you must continue with your mission and try to cross the River Storn near Tekaro. Prizo repeats Rouf’s warning that the city is occupied by the Eldenorans and encircled by Vorka regiments, but he also has some extra information that might be useful. He says that the Eldenorans have set up a military ferry on the Storn, five miles south of the confluence where the two rivers, the Quarl and the Storn, meet. In your disguise as an Eldenoran scout, you may find it is the easiest way to cross the river.</p>
<p>After breakfast, you thank Rouf and his kin for their help and you wish them luck on their journey to Salony. In return they thank you for freeing them and Fie offers you some food for the road ahead (enough for 2 Meals).

<p>‘My loyal commanders,’ says Vandyan, spreading his arms wide as if to embrace the entire hall, ‘we stand upon the threshold of total power. Already I have harnessed the might of the first rune and used it to create and control the Vorka horde. With the power of the second stone I summoned Zorkaan the Soultaker and bound him to our cause. And this night, we shall witness the release of the force contained within the third Rune of Agarash. The approaching storms from the north herald the rebirth of the Vaag, the flying spawn of Agarash the Damned!’</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration IV]</div>
<p>Vandyan’s announcement draws a loud gasp of astonishment from his officers. Legend has it that the Vaag were the most ruthless and deadly of all the Agarashi—the creatures of darkness created by Agarash the Damned. He used the Vaag to spearhead assaults upon ancient Magnamund that led to his domination of the entire planet during the Age of Eternal Night. Unhindered by mountains, rivers, and city walls, a flying horde of Vaag could indeed be a force capable of conquering Magnamund anew.</p>
<p>‘Go now!’ says Vandyan, to his stunned officers. ‘Return to your armies in the field and be ready to march. You have your orders—do not fail me. I must now return to my laboratory and attend to the final preparations. Be assured, my loyal countrymen. Soon all Magnamund shall cower at our feet!’</p>
<p>Vandyan’s final words are met with a thunderous roar of approval. The door in the north wall opens and he leaves the dais and hurries through it. As the door closes behind him with a dull boom, the Eldenoran officers gather up their maps and papers and file out of the hall, through a pair of double doors which have opened in the south wall.</p>

He yawns and then he sits down on the steps and cradles his head in his folded arms. You wait for a few minutes and then you move silently along the corridor towards him. Your mental suggestion has proved very effective for when you reach the gaoler you discover that he is soundly asleep. As you start up the stairs towards the next level, you notice a bunch of keys that are hanging from a hook on his leather belt.

<p>One of the arrows rips through your canvas cover and splinters the gunwale within inches of your head, yet all of the others fail to strike the boat. As you glide under the bridge’s central span, you hear a gruff Eldenoran sergeant cursing his men for their poor marksmanship and for wasting arrows on a derelict sailboat.</p>
<p>You are directly beneath the centre of the bridge when suddenly you feel the craft being pulled towards the starboard. The head of a Vorka suddenly appears at the side of the boat, and moments later it comes clambering over the gunwale. The creature has not seen you, but it can only be a matter of seconds before it senses where you are hiding.</p>

<p>In less than a minute the tunnel is sealed off by a solid wall of earth and broken rock. The air is thick with dust and you have difficulty seeing and breathing. Your legs have been pinned to the floor by the rockfall and, as you drag yourself free, you suddenly feel a sharp pain below your left knee where it has been gashed by a chunk of granite: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Carefully you extricate yourself from the debris and, using your infravision, you attempt to locate Hulsta. It is difficult to see through the dirt-choked air and so you rely on your heat-vision in order to detect your guide. Quickly you discover his left hand protruding from beneath the mound of fallen debris, but when you touch it you sense at once that your brave companion has not survived this disastrous avalanche.</p>

<p>Quietly you leave the chamber, retrace your steps back to the tunnel entrance, and then continue your trek along the ravine. Night is fast approaching and you have barely covered a mile when the ravine comes to an abrupt end at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west you can see the outline of a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep, wooded valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the forest for many miles. There appears to be no easy way of avoiding the gorge, but you are unwilling to attempt a descent in the dark. Instead, you decide to find somewhere safe nearby where you can make camp and await the dawn.</p>

<p>The blinding pain fades to a dull ache, but your Kai senses continue to scream out a warning. This evil entity poses a continuing threat to your body and your mind.

<p>Fortunately, your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus quickly neutralizes the small amount of venom that has entered your bloodstream. You sit up and Hulsta uses strips of cloth torn from the hem of his shirt to bandage your wounded calves.

<p>Drawing upon your advanced Kai skills, you focus on the Vorka and exude a powerful scent from the palms of your hands. This scent is abhorrent to the lizard-like creature and it causes it to shy away in disgust. It shrieks, and then it retreats towards the river where it joins with its brothers who are making short work of your provisions which they have just found hidden under the canvas.</p>
<p>The remaining Vorka suddenly detect the smell of the food and instantly they abandon their search and scurry down to the river. They arrive too late to share in the unexpected feast, and in frustration they vent their anger on the boat itself. You are taken aback by the sheer speed and ferocity of their attack which reduces your sailboat to matchwood.</p>
<p>Silently you watch the Vorka as they return to the bridge and cross once more to the other side. The incident seems to have excited the Eldenoran guards, and you can hear them laughing and cursing wildly.

<p>Your spell holds them just long enough for you to be able to reach the rune and strike it with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your blade cleaves the evil stone in two. Then the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and you are hurled backwards to the floor. Shards of broken stone whistle around you. When the rain of debris ceases, you pull yourself to your feet and look upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber. Pools of fire burn among the splinters that litter the floor of the pit, and all the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>

<p>You cross the corridor and approach the door. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that the chamber beyond it is empty, and so you twist the handle and push against the heavy portal. Silently it swings open on well-oiled hinges to reveal an empty circular room. A large iron-rimmed chute is set into its stone wall, and when you examine this opening, your stomach churns. Its surfaces are smeared with traces of human blood. You can hear the distant sound of rushing water and suddenly you realize that this chute leads directly to the river which flows beneath Duadon. From its condition and location you conclude that this chute has a single, sinister purpose: it is used by the gaolers of Skull-Tor for the swift disposal of prisoners who die in their charge.</p>

<p>You descend from the ridge and trek across a fallow field towards the derelict remains of Castle Demera, an ancient Eldenoran fortress that was besieged and destroyed by the Salonese in the year MS 4417. Its curtain walls and central keep have long since disappeared, and what little remains of its outer walls is now barely recognizable beneath a blanket of thick moss which covers every surface.</p>
<p>You enter the base of the outer walls and discover a flight of slime-smeared steps leading down into a stone chamber which offers some protection from the heavy rain. The mouldering walls of this chamber are buried beneath a profusion of plants and creepers. You take a closer look at the plants and, to your surprise, you discover a clump of laumspur hidden among the vegetation. (There is sufficient Laumspur here for 2 potions. Each Potion of Laumspur will restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat.) Heartened by this unexpected discovery, you settle yourself in the driest corner of the chamber and drift off to sleep.</p>
<p>The trundling sound of heavy wagons awakens you shortly after dawn. The rain has ceased during the night and the ruins are now bathed in warm autumn sunlight that is filtering through gaps in the clouds.

Columns of Eldenoran army wagons are moving along this highway in both directions.

<p>Using your Grand Master skills, you give voice to a ballad extolling the virtues of the Eldenoran military police.

<p>Silently you intone the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mind Charm</i> and order the Guard Captain to set you free. You also command him mentally to forget that he has ever set eyes on you upon the instant that you leave his chamber. The captain obeys without question. He calls his guards and tells them to set you free in Duadon immediately. They are shocked and surprised to hear this, but they dare not contradict their superior officer.</p>
<p>Reluctantly the guards march you away. They escort you along a corridor which leads to an empty room where a small door is set into a stone wall. It opens on to a quiet alleyway that is overshadowed by the city’s south battlements.</p>
<p>‘Be off with you!’ growls the tall guard, as he pushes you roughly through the arched doorway. The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. Quickly you leave this door and walk briskly along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed. They trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan’s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
<p>You recall Gwynian’s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city’s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you attempt to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads which lead off from the South Gate square, to the east and west.

<p>None of the arrows find their mark, but a piece of rock smashes into the planking near your feet. It tears a hole in the bottom of the boat and a spout of water gushes into the air to rain down upon your head. The Eldenorans cheer as your boat begins to founder. As it disappears from view beneath the centre arch, you hear their echoing footfalls as they rush across to the opposite side of the bridge to wait for you to reappear. When you emerge they laugh and jeer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must abandon the boat. You turn the rudder towards the left bank and aim your sinking craft at a place where a copse of willow trees overhangs the river. As you pass beneath the branches, you clamber out and quickly take cover among the trees.</p>
<p>The Eldenorans soon arrive to search the boat and the surrounding area. They fail to discover you and silently you observe them from the undergrowth as they drag your half-submerged craft out of the water and sift through its meagre contents. When they tire of this, they return to their duties at the bridge. Once the coast is clear, you leave the copse and hurry away. Only when you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans do you dare stop to rest for a few hours in the bough of an oak tree.</p>

<p>Your blow catches the enemy rider in the throat, at a weak point in his armour where the base of his helmet joins the top of his breastplate. Mortally wounded, he fights desperately to hang on to his reins as he falls from the saddle, but in so doing, he unbalances his warhorse and brings the creature crashing down on top of him. You press on through the resulting gap, and glance back to see Delissa following closely on your heels. She is an expert horsewoman and you are greatly impressed by her courage and skill. As you break free from the converging horsemen, you hear a crash of metal and the anguished cry of men and horses: the two units of Sinistrari have collided with calamitous effect. Most of the riders have been unseated, and several have perished beneath the crushing weight of their armoured horses. Only one rider appears to have survived the collision unscathed and he immediately gives chase. As you gallop towards the plateau, you glance back repeatedly at your solitary pursuer and you notice that he is stripping off pieces of his armour to lighten his horse’s burden. In so doing he is able to keep pace with your lighter mounts.</p>
<p>On reaching the plateau, you see a range of hills in the distance and Delissa points towards a pinnacle of rock that is shaped like a church spire.</p>
<p>‘Xaitar’s Rock!’ she cries, identifying the place for your rendezvous with Guildmaster Banedon. You look back once more and this time you are shocked to see that the Sinistrari rider is fast closing the gap. You realize that he will reach you before you are able to arrive at Xaitar’s Rock, and so you signal to Delissa to ride on ahead.</p>
<p>‘Go on!’ you shout. ‘I’ll join you there!’ As she gallops past, you bring your horse around to face your pursuer, and you raise your Kai Weapon in readiness to attack. Then you urge your horse forwards and race headlong towards your enemy.

<p>You come to the end of Kettle Street and turn left into a thoroughfare known as Flank Avenue. A signpost bearing its name is topped by a copper badge shaped in the likeness of a galleon with billowing sails, indicating that you are now entering Duadon’s East Quarter.</p>
<p>You walk along Flank Avenue, past the establishments of moneylenders, wagoneers, and rope-makers, until you come to a flagstoned square before the city’s East Gate. A column of scaly-skinned Vorka are marching across the square and out through the gate, accompanied by young fresh-faced Eldenoran officers on horseback. You stop to watch the Vorka and, when you look back along their ranks, you see a busy street which leads to the centre of the city. Lurking behind a hazy curtain of acrid grey smoke is the fortress of Skull-Tor, less than half a mile distant. It is from here that the Vorka are emerging. Like some foul discharge, they flow forth in green streams from the newly-constructed armouries that adjoin Vandyan’s grim stronghold.</p>
<p>You resolve to avoid Skull-Tor and continue along Flank Wall in the hope that it will lead directly to Flank Street. When a gap appears between the marching ranks, you hurry across the square and press on towards the north of the city. Soon you come to a watchtower in the northeast corner of Duadon. Your spirits rise when you see a signpost surmounted by a silver star, for it indicates that you are about to enter the Northern Quarter.

<p>Warily you ride through the north gate of Tekaro, taking care to avoid the watchful gaze of the grim-faced Eldenorans who are manning its fortified tower. Beyond the gate you enter a broad street lit by hanging lanterns. Drunken soldiers reel and sprawl along the alleyways that feed into this main avenue, and patrols of military reeves attempt in vain to maintain some semblance of order. Houses stand barred and barricaded, and the frightened eyes of native Tekaroans squint through their shuttered windows at the raucous enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>The street curves in a gentle arc towards the east and ends at a flagstoned square which is dominated by a large bronze fountain. You are about to enter the square when suddenly a patrol of military reeves comes marching around a corner, forcing you to halt to avoid colliding with them. At first their sharp-eyed sergeant simply glowers at you, but then he proceeds to scrutinize your uniform and your horse. Gruffly he demands to know what you are doing in this part of the city. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that he has noticed that the regimental number on the sleeve of your tunic does not tally with any of the regiments billeted in Tekaro, and you suspect he is thinking that you are deserter.</p>

<p>You speak the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Net</i> and point your right hand at the bottom of the steps. A gout of sticky fluid gushes from your palm and you direct this stream between the metal banister rails, sealing off the stairs with several layers of sticky fibrous strands.</p>
<p>Your spell delays the Vorka, but it does not deter or prevent them from attacking you. Several hurl themselves face-down onto the gluey strands so that others can use their backs as springboards to vault over the net. The first three to do this successfully are armed with swords.

<p>You retrace your steps back to the mine entrance and then hurry away along the base of the ravine. Dusk is fast becoming darkness and you have barely covered a mile when the ravine ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west you can see a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep, wooded valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the forest for several miles. There appears to be no easy way of avoiding the gorge, but you are far from keen to attempt any descent in the dark.

<p>You tell the Guard Captain that you were separated from your regiment during battle on the Slovarian Plain but, as you recount your fictitious story, you subtly change the tone of your voice until it becomes a soft, melodic undertone. Within minutes, the captain has become so entranced by the hypnotic sound of your voice that he becomes completely susceptible to your commands and suggestions. You tell him to let you go free and, once you have gone, to forget that he has ever set eyes on you. The captain obeys without question. He calls his guards and tells them to set you free in Duadon immediately. They are shocked to hear this, but they dare not contradict their superior officer.</p>
<p>Reluctantly the guards march you away along a corridor which leads to an empty chamber, where a small door is set into the wall. It opens on to a quiet alleyway that is overshadowed by the city’s south wall.</p>
<p>‘Be off with you!’ growls the tall guard, as he pushes you roughly through the arched doorway. The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. Quickly you leave this door and walk briskly along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed. They trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan’s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
<p>You recall Gwynian’s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city’s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you attempt to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads which lead off from the South Gate square, to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>

<p>You retrieve the Potion of Gallowbrush from your pack and pour it carefully over the slices of cold meat. Then you cover the meat with vegetables and carry the tray to the guards on duty at the Rune Hall. They prop their halberds against the wall and raise the visors of their helmets as you approach.</p>
<p>‘Where’s Gragov?’ asks a guard, as you set the tray of food down on a small table beside the door.</p>
<p>‘He’s gone sick,’ you reply.</p>
<p>‘I hope it wasn’t something he ate!’ jokes the other guard.</p>
<p>You can hear the guards eating their food as you walk back along the corridor towards the iron stairs. When you reach the bottom step, you wait here to allow the potion to take effect. After a few minutes you hear a metallic crash, and when you peer over the top step you see that the potion has done its work. Both guards are now lying unconscious in front of the door.</p>

<p>Cautiously you enter the shop to find yourself in a kitchen. Curled up and asleep in a corner is a large hunting dog. You call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control and command the animal to remain asleep before you beckon Hulsta to enter and close the rear door behind him.</p>
<p>Once inside, your guide moves quickly to another door and pulls it open. Beyond it you see a flight of steps leading down to the cellar below. Before he descends the steps, Hulsta pauses to light his lantern and then he leads the way.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ grunts the guard, ‘you can pass.’</p>
<p>Reluctantly, they uncross their spears and allow you to march out across the drawbridge, towards the open archway of the inner keep. As you reach the middle of the bridge, you look to your right and see plumes of black smoke rising up into the night sky. They originate from the chimneys of armouries located on the east side of Skull-Tor. Even at this late hour they are in full production, manufacturing an unending supply of weapons and armour for Vandyan’s Vorka hordes.</p>
<p>Upon entering the archway of the inner keep, you find yourself standing in a circular hall that is hung with tapestries and framed portraits. At a desk positioned in the middle of this hall sits an Eldenoran scribe who is busily writing in a ledger with a quill pen. He is so engrossed with his work that he does not acknowledge your presence in any way. Behind him you see a flight of stairs spiralling up to the floor above, and on either side of the entrance arch there are open portals which lead off to the left and right.</p>

<p>As the last of the Eldenorans falls victim to your deadly blows, the mongrel dog yelps with fright and bounds away along the tunnel. You wipe and sheathe your weapon and then enter the chamber to investigate the Eldenoran’s hoard of loot.</p>
<p>Among bulging bags of silver Slovian Lune, ornate candlesticks, polished silver plates, and gemstones, you uncover one item of greater value than all of the others put together. It is a golden chalice set with rubies and emeralds. You examine it closely and conclude that it was stolen from Tekaro Cathedral. (If you wish to take the Tekaro Chalice, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.)</p>
<p>Having satisfied yourself that you have not overlooked anything else of special value, you leave the mine and continue your trek along the ravine.

They are poring over charts and battle-maps which detail the positions of their Vorka hordes and the defensive lines of the Freeland armies.</p>

When she is satisfied that you will pass for her cousin Jac, you leave the parlour and collect two saddled horses from a small stable at the rear of the workshop. You mount up and Delissa leads the way along an alley that gives access to Flank Street. At the end of the street you arrive at a plaza located before the city’s North Gate. It is late afternoon, a time when this square is normally crowded with people, yet as you ride towards the north gatehouse you can count the number of citizens that you see on the fingers of one hand.</p>
<p>On reaching the gate you are challenged by the spear-wielding guardsmen and told to dismount. Delissa protests, and she demands to see the Sergeant of the Guard. The sergeant arrives and greets Delissa with a wide smile. They are old friends. The sergeant listens sympathetically to her story that you are her cousin and together you are bound for Luyen to nurse her sick sister. When she has finished her tale, the sergeant nods his approval to a face that is peering out from a window of the gatehouse.

You draw upon your healing skills to mend your wounds as you escape along the street and ride across the square that lies at its end. There are several exits from this square, but you choose the least-busy one to make your escape. This tree-lined avenue bears west towards Tekaro Cathedral. The Eldenorans have turned the city’s magnificent building into a dormitory for their troops and, as you pass by its grand doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers sleeping on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard your bloodstained clothing with suspicion as your horse plods its way forward. Gently you urge him to increase his pace for fear that they may stop and challenge you.</p>
<p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls, you come to the city’s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at you and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. As the gate creaks open you ride through it and out onto the highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the shimmering waters of the River Storn and you follow it for a few miles before turning your horse away towards the river. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>

<p>You pull yourself onto the platform and run at Vandyan with your weapon held poised to strike. Wild-eyed with manic excitement, he stares intently at the crystal saucer and seems not to notice that you are about to cut him down. But as you make your attack, he snatches up an iron staff that protrudes from a hole in the platform, and expertly he fends off your blow. The blade of your weapon trails a line of sparks as it scrapes along the length of his staff and clatters against the rail which encircles the platform. He stabs at you with its clawed tip and you dodge this vicious blow, but then you strike again and send the staff spinning from his hands. He emits a strangled cry of fear and frustration and backs away to the edge of the platform. Glancing to the crystal saucer, and then to the glinting weapon that you hold in your hands, suddenly his nerve breaks. He kicks a lever at the edge of the platform and a trapdoor springs open to reveal a dangling rope. Cursing you and vowing eternal revenge, he scrambles through the trapdoor and slides rapidly down the rope to the hall below. As he runs towards the door your first instinct is to pursue him, to prevent him from getting away. But your Kai senses warn you that the storm is peaking. Unless you smash the last remaining rune, the Vaag will materialize and Vandyan will have won.</p>

<p>Having finished your briefing, Gwynian and Lone Wolf show you to a room at the rear of the tavern where some items of clothing have been laid out for your inspection. Lone Wolf tells you to take off your helmet and Kai battle-armour and exchange them for the plain green tunic, breeches, and cloak of a Kai journeyman that lie draped across a table.</p>
<p>‘These clothes will serve you well,’ he says, as he buckles the clasp of your cloak. ‘They are far less likely to attract unwelcome attentions during your journey to Duadon.’</p>
<p>Having exchanged your clothes, you are provided with a meal and told to stay here in this room until midnight—the time when your mission is set to begin. Lone Wolf and Gwynian bid you good luck and leave the room to allow you to rest. You manage to get a few hours’ uneasy sleep before Gwynian returns shortly before midnight. The sage escorts you from the tavern and leads you down to the waterfront, to a wharf where a battered little sailboat lies tethered alongside a river barge. At first glance this sailboat looks completely unseaworthy, but upon closer inspection you see that it has been carefully camouflaged with broken timbers and ripped canvas to give the impression that it is a wreck. Stowed on board are a pair of oars and enough food and water for the voyage downstream to Tekaro. You board the boat and Gwynian casts off the mooring rope, bidding you good luck and godspeed as gently the current carries you away.</p>
<p>The waters of the Quarl are fast-flowing and you have no need of sail nor oar to propel you. By means of the rudder, you are able to steer the boat and let the current carry you swiftly downstream towards your destination. When dawn breaks you are able to take stock of your surroundings. You are making good progress and you calculate that it should take you no more than three days to reach Tekaro. The first day passes uneventfully and you are able to relax and enjoy the views of the fertile countryside that fringes the Quarl. But as darkness begins to fall at the end of the second day, you catch sight of something in the distance that sets your pulse racing. As you round a bend, you see a stone bridge spanning the river little more than a mile downstream. A line of burning torches is fixed along its parapeted walls, and armed guards are positioned on either side of its span. A look at your <a href="#map">map</a> tells you that this bridge carries the road that connects the towns of Woeld and Tido, and when you magnify your vision, you see that the guards are enemy soldiers. They wear studded leather jerkins and have the circle-and-star emblem of Eldenora engraved upon their conical steel helmets. To your dismay, an eagle-eyed lookout posted at the centre of the bridge sees your boat approaching. He alerts his fellow guards and quickly they line up along the parapet of the bridge and unshoulder their bows. One of their number blows a shrill whistle which attracts the attention of a second group who are moving through the trees which border the right bank. Your stomach churns when you catch your first sight of these troops for they are not human—they are Vorka. These lizard-like creatures move with a sinister grace which betrays their ancient origins. A cold fire glows in the depths of their sharp, blinking eyes, and their scaly bodies are bedecked with fragments of armour, mostly rotting leather and chainmail looted from the bodies of their slain foes.</p>
<p>As your boat drifts inexorably towards the bridge, you see the Eldenorans are getting ready to fire their first volley. The tips of some of their arrows are wound round with strips of oily cloth and they have been set alight. Hurriedly you look for some means of avoiding these archers and their Vorka cohorts, but only the river’s wooded left bank seems devoid of the enemy.</p>

<p>‘By whose authority are you here, trooper?’ he demands. You show him your wristband, but this does little to allay his suspicions. Suddenly he grabs the hilt of your Kai Weapon and he tugs it from its scabbard. ‘This is not an Eldenoran sabre,’ he says, inspecting the blade. ‘Why is it in your possession? Did you loot it?’ Other commanders, drawn by the accusing tone of his voice, begin to take an unwelcome interest in you and quickly you find yourself surrounded on all sides by stern-faced officers. One of them steps forward and he points at your weapon. ‘By Naar!’ he exclaims. ‘That’s a Kai blade!’</p>
<p>Suddenly you are grabbed from behind and dragged to the ground. You struggle to break free, but you are quickly overwhelmed by the weight of numbers ranged against you. Guards are summoned and you are held securely until they arrive.</p>

<p>The sergeant narrows his eyes and his knuckles whiten as he tightens his grip on his spear. You sense that he does not believe your story and he is suspicious of your true purpose here.</p>
<p>‘There’re no reinforcements due for two days,’ he growls. ‘You’d better show me your orders, trooper, or I’ll take you for a deserter.’</p>
<p>The sergeant glances over his shoulder to his two companions seated at the fire. They have been listening to your conversation and immediately they get to their feet and come running towards you with their spears at the ready. Calmly you reach into the pocket of your tunic, as if you are obeying the sergeant’s request, but then you kick your horse’s flanks and flick his reins. As he surges away, the sergeant and his men lunge at you with their steel-tipped spears.</p>

<p>You recite the words of the spell and launch a bolt of energy that strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a loud <i>Crack!</i> and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as the evil stone is sundered in two. Seconds later, the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and instinctively you cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken stone cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers. When this deluge ceases, you look with fearful expectation upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber.</p>
<p>Pools of fire burn among the shards that litter the floor of the pit, and the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>
<p>The noise of the destruction and the hellish dying shrieks of the Vorka horde alert Vandyan to your presence in the hall below. You look up and see his face twisted with hate and rage. He raises a glowing silver disc, clasped tightly in the palm of his right hand, and he spits out a vile curse that chills your blood.</p>

<p>You discover that the door to the vault is unlocked, and so you pull it open and enter a dark corridor which ends at a stone staircase. Torchlight pours down the steps from the level above and, as you move closer, you hear the echoing sound of footsteps. Carefully you ascend the stairs until you are able to peer over the top step. Ahead you can see another corridor, but this one is illuminated by a line of burning torches set into brackets on either side of a dozen prison cell doors. At the far end there is another flight of ascending steps, and at its base there stands an Eldenoran gaoler armed with a sword. You watch this gaoler and consider the best way you can lure him away from the stairs, for he is blocking your only known route to the surface.</p>

<p>Rouf is hugged by his uncle and aunt who are overcome with emotion to see their favourite nephew once more. They thank you both for freeing them and they curse the Eldenorans who invaded their home. When Rouf tells his kin that you are a Kai Lord on a secret mission, their eyes widen with awe. Prizo warns you that there are many Eldenorans in this area and that it is no longer a safe place. He invites you both to stay here this night but he says you must remain watchful. Reluctantly Prizo and his wife have decided to leave their home. They plan to cross the Quarl and seek shelter in Salony. Many Slovian refugees, including other members of Rouf’s family, have found sanctuary there in the Great Forest.</p>
<p>You and Rouf take turns to keep watch during the night, and shortly before dawn you awaken his uncle and aunt. Fie prepares a delicious breakfast and while you are eating they discuss their plans. Rouf has decided to join his aunt and uncle and go with them to Salony. You tell them that you must continue with your mission and try to cross the River Storn near Tekaro. Prizo repeats Rouf’s warning that the city is occupied by the Eldenorans, but he also has some information that could be useful. He says that the Eldenorans have set up a military ferry on the Storn, five miles south of the confluence where the two rivers, the Quarl and the Storn, meet. In your disguise as an Eldenoran scout, you may find it the easiest way to cross the river.</p>
<p>After breakfast, you thank Rouf and his kin for their help and you wish them luck on their journey to Salony. In return they thank you for freeing them and Fie offers you some food for the road ahead (enough for 2 Meals). Then they bid you farewell and wave goodbye from the doorway as you leave the cabin and go to retrieve your horse.</p>

<p>Your enemy’s weapon clips your head and a flash of white light engulfs your vision. Then, in the next instant, you feel yourself tumbling backwards into a yawning dark abyss.</p>
<p>The blow from your enemy’s spiked ball and chain renders you unconscious and sends you spinning out of the saddle. You are spared the pain of impact when you crash head-first to the highway, but sadly you never regain consciousness. The Sinistrari captain brings his horse about and ruthlessly he tramples your helpless body beneath his hooves. Death is painless and instantaneous.</p>
<p>You may take some comfort from the fact that you fulfilled your vital mission. By destroying the Runes of Agarash you have saved Magnamund from the tyrannical rule of Vandyan and his monstrous horde. It is a great victory, but one that you have paid for with your life.</p>

<p>A strong wind arises and the ominous sound of thunder rolls across the forest, causing the ground to tremble beneath your feet. You look to the darkening sky and see distant flashes of lightning illuminating a bank of thick cloud that is sweeping in from the west. A violent storm is approaching and droplets of rain are already beginning to spatter your head and shoulders.</p>
<p>You hurry along the ravine in search of shelter from the coming storm. Lightning is striking closer, forking down into the forest with spectacular effect. You have barely covered a mile of the shallow ravine when it ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west, you can see a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the timberland for several miles. There is no easy way to avoid the gorge, but equally you have no wish to descend it during a storm. The rain is getting heavier and the lightning strikes are increasing, and so you decide to seek safe shelter at the rocky knoll.</p>

<p>You follow Hulsta to the rear of his shop and out through an open door that gives access to a walled yard. At the end of this yard stands a large, timber-framed, two-storey building. The lower floor is a workshop and the upper level is where Hulsta and his wife live. You climb a flight of iron steps to the door of their living quarters, and Delissa greets her husband with a broad smile the moment he appears. Her smile quickly fades, however, when she sees you following behind.</p>
<p>‘Why’d you bring him up to the parlour? Can’t y’keep shop business downstairs where it belongs?’ complains Delissa.</p>
<p>‘Now, don’t go taking offence, my dear,’ replies Hulsta, soothingly. ‘He’s not what he seems. He’s the one we’ve been waiting for. He’s Gwynian’s man—a Kai—all the way from Sommerlund.’</p>
<p>‘My lord, please forgive me,’ says Delissa. ‘Pay no heed to what I said. I’m greatly honoured to meet you.’</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VI]</div>
<p>‘And so too am I,’ echoes Hulsta, enthusiastically, ‘for you have arrived not a moment too soon.’ He asks why it is that you are dressed as an Eldenoran scout, and you take time to recount the events of your difficult journey to Duadon. When you have finished your account, Hulsta informs you of recent developments.</p>
<p>‘The numbers of Vorka leaving Skull-Tor have greatly increased during the last seven days. Vandyan’s power grows stronger by the hour,’ he warns. ‘My lord, you must enter Skull-Tor and destroy the runes tonight…else Varetta is doomed. The time is ripe for action. Vandyan and the Runes of Agarash are all together in one place. They are vulnerable now. We cannot be sure of a chance like this again.’</p>
<p>‘Very well, I shall do what must be done. But how can I gain entry to Skull-Tor?’ you ask. ‘I have seen Vandyan’s stronghold and it is truly formidable.’</p>
<p>‘Have no fear, my lord,’ replies Hulsta with confidence. ‘There is a secret way by which you can enter Skull-Tor unseen. It is an ancient way. Let me show you.’</p>

<p>You walk along Flank Wall, past the workshops of hatters, lamp-makers, and potters, until you come to a flagstoned square in the shadow of the city’s West Gate. An unending stream of wagons, each piled high with timber and iron ore, pours into the city through this gateway. They trundle across the square and along a wide thoroughfare called Corvayl Avenue which leads directly to Skull-Tor. You stop to look along this busy street and, through a hazy curtain of acrid smoke, you catch your first glimpse of the imposing arched entrance to Vandyan’s stronghold. It resembles the toothed and fleshless jaw of a huge shark.</p>

<p>You step over the guards’ bodies and press your shoulder to the door, letting the heavy portal swing open just a few inches. Cold air rushes out, chilling your face, and your Kai senses tingle when you feel the evil power of the runes bleeding from the hall beyond. Steeling yourself for what may lie ahead, you push against the door again and slip in through the widening gap.</p>
<p>Before you lies a magnificent chamber hewn from polished obsidian. Colossal columns rise along its curved walls, and iron cradles filled with glowing stones illuminate the jet-black surfaces. Away to your right you can see a metal staircase leading down to the bottom of a vast pit. At its centre there stands a great black bell-like object that is sheathed with crackling energies, sparking and fusing noisily. You take a step forward and gasp when you first see the line of Vorka that are emerging from the side of this belled chamber. Like scaly automatons, they march forth in an endless stream that disappears into an archway on the far side of the pit. You sense the presence of a rune and, when you scour the bell-chamber using your magnified vision, you glimpse the oblong of black stone embedded into its surface.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VII]</div>
<p>To your left, facing the stairs to the pit, there is another bell-chamber. It is identical in shape and size to the one below, yet this one is constructed from a clear, glass-like mineral. Within its core there stands a frozen column of black mist, and set into a hollow in its flared top you can see a second rune.</p>
<p>Your Sixth Sense tells you that there are three runes present in this great hall, yet it is not until you look up at the domed ceiling that you locate the third. On a wide circular platform suspended below an aperture at the top of the dome, you see Lord Vandyan. He is fixing the third rune into a saucer of crystal and he is so engrossed in this task that he fails to see that you are standing in the hall below. Through the aperture in the dome you can see the night sky. Cold winds howl and bolts of lightning flash and sizzle, ripping apart the clouds as the power of a supernatural storm builds to a frightening crescendo above Skull-Tor.</p>

Guards posted on the steps regard you with suspicion as your horse plods its way forward, and so you urge him on a little faster in case they are thinking of stopping and challenging you.</p>
<p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls, you come to the city’s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at your uniform and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. As the gate creaks open, you ride through it and out onto the highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the shimmering waters of the River Storn and you follow it for a few miles before turning your horse away towards the river. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>

<p>‘There’s nothing here,’ he says to his comrade. ‘Let’s be on our way. We’ve other places to check before dawn.’</p>

<p>Your killing blow severs the serpent’s head. For several moments its powerful body continues to thrash the water, whipping the surface to a crimson froth, but then it falls still and is carried away by the swift current.</p>
<p>You beckon Hulsta to follow as you wade through the icy water towards a grill that is fixed into the ceiling. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you are able to loosen the dirt which holds this grill in place. Then you force it out of its seating and pull yourself through the opening which leads into the tunnel above. Hulsta passes you his lantern and, as you rest it on the tunnel floor, you are pleased to see that you have emerged at a point beyond the wall. Hurriedly you help pull your companion out of the freezing water. He is shivering uncontrollably and he cannot move his legs. Using your innate Kai healing powers, you are able to transmit warmth into his frozen muscles and restore the blood circulation. (Use of your Discipline in this way costs you 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.)</p>
<p>When Hulsta has recovered the full use of his legs, you continue your exploration of the tunnel towards the east. You have covered several hundred yards before he calls you to a halt. He holds his lantern up to the wall and you notice that the stonework is changing. A ragged seam encircles the tunnel where brown brickwork meets rough grey rock.</p>
<p>‘This is good,’ says Hulsta, approvingly. ‘We’re passing through the granite foundations of Skull-Tor. According to the plans, this tunnel runs to a dungeon store room. It is located three levels below the surface. We have not far to go now—perhaps two hundred paces at most.’</p>
<p>You are about to lead the way when suddenly you hear a rumbling sound and feel a tremor run through the floor.</p>
<p>‘What was that?’ you ask, anxiously.</p>
<p>‘Ore wagons, most likely,’ replies Hulsta. ‘We must be directly below the West Gate of Skull-Tor.’</p>
<p>Hulsta stops to replace the candle in his lantern, and as he does so, you ask him what you can expect to find when you reach the tunnel’s end.</p>
<p>‘The plans indicated a secret panel which can be opened from both sides,’ he replies. ‘When we reach the panel, I shall stay in the tunnel and await your return. I’ll only be a burden if I accompany you, and I have no wish to endanger your vital mission. You must enter Skull-Tor alone and make your way up to the surface.

<p>Hulsta’s words are suddenly drowned by a deafening noise. The floor shifts violently and you are hurled onto your back as the passageway heaves and shakes.

They are to lock the door, but they are not to confiscate any of your Weapons or equipment. As ordered, the guards escort you away and put you in a cell which is illuminated by daylight. It streams in through a solitary barred window. As soon as they leave, you drag a chair over to the window and stand on it in order to get a better view of what lies outside.

They are determined to prevent you from getting away. As you reach the entrance to the shaft, you pause to draw your Kai Weapon and land a blow at the base of a ceiling prop. The rotten timber rips in two and several tons of rock cascade into the tunnel. When the dust settles you see that the mine shaft is now sealed off. You allow yourself a wry smile; it will take the Eldenorans more than a day to dig themselves out from their hiding place.</p>
<p>You leave the collapsed mine entrance and hurry away along the base of the ravine. Night is fast approaching and you have barely covered a mile when the ravine ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west you can see the outline of a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep, wooded valley.

You stretch out your arm and aim your index finger at the Eldenoran thief as he is mounting his horse. There is a loud <i>Crack!</i> and a bolt of blue fire leaps from your finger and arcs towards his back. It strikes him in the neck and spins him from his saddle with the searing force of its impact. Limply, the looter crashes to the ground, his thieving days over for good.</p>

<p>Your killing blow sends the Ogron tumbling down the ramp towards the onrushing guardsmen. They sidestep his body, and two of them let loose a parting arrow at your back as you disappear through the open gate which leads to Cillan Square, the paved thoroughfare surrounding the stronghold of Skull-Tor.</p>
<p>The worst of the storm has abated and the night sky is cloudless and clear, yet this does little to assist your escape from Vandyan’s dreaded fortress. The moon is full and the surrounding streets and houses are illuminated by its ashen rays. On reaching the square, you immediately turn to the north in the hope of finding a way to get back to the cooperage in Flank Street. The square is littered with the bodies of Vorka, and many Eldenoran citizens have left their beds to examine this disturbing spectacle. They huddle in groups on street corners and speculate in hushed tones about the likely demise of their leader.</p>
<p>You are hurrying along the northern flank of Cillan Square when suddenly you hear a sound that puts ice in your veins.</p>

<p>You crawl to the open door and look down to see a wide, stone-paved pathway which leads from the main farmhouse to the barn. There is no ladder, and a rope pulley that is fixed to a wooden gantry above the door is missing its rope. You hear the farmer’s son climbing the ladder to the loft and you steel yourself in readiness to jump through the doorway to the ground, some 30 feet below.</p>

<p>You turn and sprint across the drawbridge towards the distant archway, but as you are nearing its centre, you hear the bridge bell ring out in alarm. Moments later, a score of guards appear at a parapet above the entrance to the inner keep, and an icy dagger of fear stabs your heart when you see that they are armed with loaded crossbows. The guard sergeant screams an order to these men to open fire and, in a terrible instant, you are cut down by a volley of deadly steel bolts.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your mission end here, on the drawbridge to the inner keep of Skull-Tor.</p>

<p>You retreat from the edge of the gorge and set up a camp for the night in a mossy hollow surrounded by five tall pines. The spongy moss provides a comfortable bed and you hope the canopy of interlocking branches will keep you from getting wet. Tired from your long trek you settle down and fall asleep within minutes, but within the hour you are awoken by a deafening boom of thunder.</p>
<p>You open your eyes and see that it is raining heavily. The pines have kept you dry, but your shelter is not a safe one. The tall trees are efficient lightning conductors and you now find yourself in the middle of a violent electrical storm. You are struggling to your feet when suddenly a bolt of forked lightning strikes the top of the trees. There is a blinding explosion of blue-white light and you are hurled into the air by the force of the blast when this powerful bolt streaks to earth.</p>

<p>Hulsta groans when he sees that the passage ahead is blocked by a solid brick wall. He holds up his lantern and its yellow light washes over the uneven surface, illuminating mouldering mortar which is several centuries old. He taps the stonework with the hilt of his dagger and listens expertly to its dull note. ‘More than 3 feet thick,’ he mutters. ‘It’ll take time to dig through this.’</p>
<p>Delayed but undeterred by the wall, you and Hulsta try hard to think of a way to reach the tunnel beyond and you determine two possibilities. The first is to dig a hole in the wall just large enough through which to crawl. The second is to retrace your steps to the last floor grating that you passed. If you are able to remove this grating and drop down into the underground river, the current would carry you along. You could pass under the brick wall and then return to the tunnel through the first grating that you find.</p>

<p>The night passes without incident and you wake at dawn to the shrill sound of bird song. As you are preparing to breakfast on some of the provisions that Gwynian has supplied for your voyage, you suddenly hear the sound of hoofbeats away to the south. The trees of this area are densely packed and so you climb an oak in the hope of getting a better view of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Through a thinning canopy of autumn leaves you catch sight of a forest track which runs parallel to the river. A distant flicker of movement catches your eye and, when you magnify your vision, you see three riders approaching from the south. Two are armed and they wear the uniforms of Eldenoran cavalry scouts, but the third is clad in a tunic of scarlet and black: the colours of the Slovian army. His hands are tied and you suspect he is a prisoner of war.</p>
<p>Less than a hundred yards away to the south, the track emerges from the trees and runs along the river bank for a short distance before turning again into the forest. When the riders reach this part of the track, they see your boat and they bring their horses to a halt. One of the Eldenorans stays with the Slovian prisoner while the other descends to the bank to investigate. Patiently you wait for them to go, but your patience breaks when you see the Eldenoran callously setting fire to your craft. Silently you unsheathe your Kai Weapon. As soon as the arsonist returns to his horse, you leap from your hiding place and take both of the Eldenorans by surprise.</p>

<p>You climb the stairs and follow a winding corridor which leads to a magnificent marble chamber, lit by a glowing orb which hangs suspended in mid-air. The walls are covered with battle scenes, freshly engraved, which depict the victories of Vandyan’s Vorka hordes against the Freeland armies of the Stornlands. On a table at the far end of the chamber you discover a wooden rack which contains three stoppered vials. In each of these glass tubes there is a coloured, jelly-like liquid: one red, one yellow, and one blue.</p>

<p>When you do not meet his demand, the taller guard unsheathes his sword and holds it to your chest. ‘Get your hands up!’ he barks, and meekly you comply; to resist would be dangerous and futile. The guard orders the portcullis to be lowered and then he instructs the queue of wagons that they must wait while they escort you to the gatehouse. The whistles and jeers of the impatient wagon drivers ring in your ears as you are marched away to the guardhouse and taken before the Guard Captain. He is a snub-nosed officer with a brutal demeanour. He orders the two gate guards to wait outside his door while he questions you. When they have left, he takes note of the regimental number that is embroidered on the sleeve of your tunic and then he checks it against lists of regiments that are pinned to the wall.</p>
<p>‘Your unit is posted for combat on the Slovarian Plain, trooper,’ he says, in a menacingly quiet way. ‘You had better give good reason for being here or, by Naar, I’ll see you hanged for desertion.’</p>

<p>Your abrupt reply seems to satisfy the sergeant. He knows only too well that there is no ‘Square of the Dragons’ in the centre of Luyen, nor an armourer called Daliem. He is trying to trick you. You tell him that he must be mistaking Luyen for some other city, and he laughs: ‘Of course, of course. I meant Kron. My cousin Daliem lives in Kron, not Luyen.’</p>
<p>The rising gate reaches its full height and creaks to a halt. Delissa says farewell and the sergeant replies by bidding you both a safe journey. Then his guardsmen move aside so that the way is clear for you to leave Duadon.</p>

<p>You steer your horse away from the highway and set off across the fields, threading your way slowly through Vorka encampments and clusters of parked baggage wagons. The glowing eyes and the vile smell of the cold-blooded reptilians make your skin crawl. It also disturbs your horse, and it is only through the swift use of your Magnakai skill of Animal Control that you are able to prevent him from rearing up and bolting away.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VIII]</div>
<p>The clear night brings with it a sharp frost that sparkles in the starlight, but only a few campfires have been lit. The Vorka have little need of heat, and these fires are solely for the benefit of the humans assigned to command them. You sense that the Eldenorans dislike being in the company of their Vorka troops, and those who are encamped with them harbour a bitter envy of their luckier comrades who are billeted in Tekaro.</p>
<p>As you are riding past one of the campfires, a disgruntled Eldenoran sergeant looks up from the burning embers and calls out for you to come and join him and his two companions.</p>

<p>The bitter shock of Hulsta’s sudden demise hits you like a warhammer in the chest. For several minutes you kneel and stare at his lifeless hand as you struggle to overcome your feelings of grief and remorse. When at last you feel able to continue, you stand up and salute your fallen companion. Then you say a short prayer to the Goddess Ishir to watch over his soul, and you vow to complete your mission in his honour. The swift and successful destruction of the runes will be the best way to ensure that his ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>With grim resolve you leave the rockfall and follow the tunnel away to the east, but you have covered little more than 100 yards when you come to a dead end. You recall what Hulsta had said earlier, and when you examine the wall closely you discover a secret panel. At waist level a raised lever protrudes from the left wall, but when you attempt to pull it down you find that its ancient mechanism has jammed.</p>

<p>You scramble through the trapdoor and slide down the rope to the hall below. You have barely touched the floor when a snarling guardsman rushes forwards and swings his battle-axe at your legs. Instinctively you leap high and avoid his clumsy blow and, at the height of your jump, you lash out with your foot and catch the Eldenoran squarely under the chin. The force of your kick lifts him off his feet and leaves him sprawled unconscious on the floor.</p>
<p>Arrows zip past and one rips the cuff of your tunic. Before the archers can reload and fire again, you rush to the edge of the pit and leap over the rail. Your fall is broken by the body of a Vorka and you are able to rise quickly to your feet.

Your hopes rise when you see the name ‘Flank Street’ among them, and hurriedly you set off towards it.</p>

<p>The three unseen dials prove very difficult to manipulate by the use of your Magnakai skill of Nexus alone.

Slowly the dials take form in your mind’s eye, but the numbers engraved around their edges remain hazy and indistinct.</p>
<p>At length you determine that the correct position of the three dials is equivalent to the answers to the following three questions:</p>

<li>How many gate guards did you encounter when you first arrived at Duadon?</li>
<li>How many Grand Master Disciplines are achieved upon reaching the rank of Kai Grand Guardian?</li>
<li>How many bridges still remained intact at Quarlen when the New Order Kai entered the town?</li>

Another shrill whistle signals to the Vorka and you see them go scurrying back towards the bridge. Using your Kai camouflage skills you are able to slip away from the boat and take cover in the trees unseen. As you lie in the undergrowth, you watch the Vorka cross the bridge and come loping along the river bank towards your boat. Their eyes glow eerily in the moonlit darkness, and the sight of their glinting fangs sends a chill shiver down your spine.

<p>Tenaciously you fight to remain in the saddle despite the pain of your injury, and your horse carries you away from the yelling reeves and back to the main street. You draw upon your healing skills to mend your gashed leg as you escape along the street and ride across the square that lies at its end. There are several exits from this square, but you choose the least-busy one to make your escape. This tree-lined avenue bears west towards Tekaro Cathedral. The Eldenorans have turned the city’s magnificent building into a dormitory for their troops and, as you pass by its grand doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers sleeping on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard your blood-spattered breeches with suspicion as your horse plods its way forward. Gently you urge him to increase his pace for fear that they may stop and challenge you.</p>
<p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls, you come to the city’s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at you and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. As the gate creaks open you ride through it and out onto the highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the shimmering waters of the River Storn and you follow it for a few miles before turning your horse away towards the river. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>

<p>You continue along the tunnel for several hundred yards until Hulsta calls you to a halt. He holds his lantern up to the wall and you notice that the stonework is changing. A ragged seam encircles the tunnel where brown brickwork meets rough grey rock.</p>
<p>‘This is good,’ says Hulsta, approvingly. ‘We’re passing through the granite foundations of Skull-Tor. According to the plans, this tunnel runs to a dungeon store room, three levels below the surface. We have not far to go now—perhaps two hundred paces at most.’</p>
<p>You are about to lead the way when suddenly you hear a rumbling sound and feel a tremor run through the floor.</p>

<p>‘Ore wagons, most likely,’ replies Hulsta. ‘We must be directly below the West Gate of Skull-Tor.’</p>
<p>Hulsta stops to replace the candle in his lantern, and as he does so, you ask him what you can expect to find when you reach the tunnel’s end.</p>
<p>‘The plans indicate a secret panel which can be opened from both sides,’ he replies. ‘When we reach the panel, I shall stay in the tunnel and await your return. I’ll only be a burden if I accompany you, and I have no wish to endanger your vital mission. You must enter Skull-Tor alone and make your way up to the surface.

<p>‘Ishir be praised! My prayers have been heard!’ yells the Slovian prisoner gleefully when his captors are felled by your deadly blows. As you step over their bodies and approach him, he leans forward in his saddle and holds out his hands, inviting you to cut through the rope that is wound tightly around his wrists.</p>
<p>‘My eternal thanks, sire,’ he says, as you sever his bonds. He then jumps down from his horse and offers his hand in friendship. ‘My name’s Rouf,’ he says, and a wide smile cracks his dark, travel-grimy features. ‘Those Eldenoran curs captured me on the plain east o’ Tekaro two days past. I was left behind to spy on their movements when my regiment pulled back to Suentina. Seems we may have somethin’ in common, you and I. We’re both operatin’ behind enemy lines, eh?’</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration IX]</div>
<p>The jovial Slovian helps you to hide the dead Eldenorans in the dense undergrowth. During this task he asks if you are a mercenary from Casiorn. When you tell him that you are a Kai, his jaw drops open with amazement. ‘A Kai Lord…here in Slovia! Ishir be praised. Perhaps we shall win this war after all.’ You confide in Rouf that you are on a secret mission and that you must reach the River Storn near Tekaro as soon as you can. He offers to help but he warns you that the city of Tekaro has fallen to the Eldenorans. They occupy the city and have thousands of their Vorka encamped outside its walls. From Tekaro they have been sending reinforcements to their armies fighting across the Slovarian Plain and along the River Suen. This whole region is alive with enemy patrols and it will be difficult for you to avoid them on your way to the Storn. Rouf suggests that you wear one of the dead Eldenoran’s uniforms, and that he accompany you on the road to Tekaro, posing as your prisoner. His uncle lives in the forest near the River Quarl, a day’s ride from here, and that is where he wants to go now that he is free.</p>
<p>You agree to his plan and swap your Kai journeyman clothes for the uniform of a dead Eldenoran scout. (You stow your own kit in your Backpack, which requires space equal to two normal items. If your Backpack is full, you must discard two items to create sufficient space for your Kai Clothes.) Having changed uniform, you mount one of the Eldenoran horses and ride with Rouf back along the forest track heading south towards Tekaro.</p>

<p>You walk past the scribe’s table and ascend the staircase to the floor above where you discover a corridor lined with marble statues. A black door with a shiny lacquered surface stands at the far end of the corridor, held secure by a combination lock. The three copper dials that protrude from its lock are arranged in the shape of a triangle. You place your ear to the door at the centre of this triangle and, by the use of your Magnakai skills, you are able to hear the delicate sound of the tumbler mechanisms as you turn each dial. By turning each of the dials to its correct setting you will cause the lock to disengage and the door will open.</p>
<p>You determine that the setting for the first dial is identical to the number given to the Kai name prefix <em>True</em>. The second dial setting is identical to the number given to the Kai name suffix <em>Hawk</em>. And the third dial setting is identical to the number of Kai Weapons that you are permitted to carry and use.</p>

<p>‘Would you overlook my mistakes if I were to donate a few Gold Crowns to the gatehouse?’ you say, picking your words with care.</p>

<p>You have successfully fought off the first Vorka wave, but a larger group is now emerging from the distant archway. Each of these warriors wields a sword and is clad in chainmail armour. Fear grips your stomach when you realize that they are the advance guard of a whole Vorka regiment. Once more you turn your attention to the bell-chamber, for only by destroying the rune can you hope to defeat the entire horde.</p>
<p>You descend halfway down the stairs, and then leap over the banister and drop to the floor of the pit below. On landing, those unarmed Vorka who are defending the rune hiss at you vehemently. Their sibilant cry warns their armoured brothers of your intentions and you see them quicken their pace. Your pulse pounds loudly in your ears as you determine that the first of the armoured regiment can reach you in less than a minute. There is no time to hesitate—you must act at once. With your battle-cry upon your lips, you rush forward and attack the Vorka who are standing in a protective wall before the rune.</p>

<p>You pull the Phosphor Bomb from your Backpack and hurl it at the Vorka who are swarming up the stairs. It smashes and explodes at their feet, showering the leading half-dozen with hissing white fragments of burning metal and flaming oil. The creatures hit by the blast are thrown back onto those behind them, and they all tumble down the steps in a tangled burning heap. Your deadly weapon has delayed their advance, but it will not stop the waves of armed Vorka that continue to emerge from the distant archway.</p>
<p>You rush to the head of the stairs and focus your gaze at the rune that is embedded into the side of the bell-chamber. Only by destroying this rune can you stem the Vorka tide. Vandyan is also aware of this and he screams an order to those creatures that are closest to the chamber. In response, they close ranks and use their bodies to form a protective wall in front of the rune.</p>

<p>You hurry away from the farm and head due north, a course that takes you across open fields and through an old abandoned vineyard. The rain has ceased during the night and the land is now bathed with rays of warm autumn sunlight that filter down through gaps in the clouds. A mile beyond the vineyard you catch sight of a sunken highway, partially hidden by hedgerows. Columns of Eldenoran army wagons are moving along this paved highway in both directions.

At first he does not seem to react to your soporific dirge, but then you notice that he is starting to yawn repeatedly. After a few minutes, he sits down on the steps and cradles his head in his folded arms. You continue your hypnotic chant for a few minutes longer and then, when you are sure that it has had the desired effect, you leave your hiding place and move silently along the corridor. The gaoler is snoring softly when you reach him and you sense that he has fallen into a deep sleep. As you start up the stairs towards the next level, you notice a bunch of keys hanging from a hook attached to his leather belt.

<p>The closely-packed pines of the Grochod Forest compete for sunlight and fresh air, and beneath their canopy of thick foliage exists a separate world of shadows and cool gloom.

At noon you stop to rest and consult your <a href="#map">map</a>.

Less than a hundred yards to the west you see a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts into the deep ravine, and to the east the tree-line follows the rim for many miles.

<p>Fearing that one of their officers has caught them looting, the Eldenorans drop their plunder and scramble for the door. Two come running through the doorway and they are cut down by your waiting blades, but the third looter leaves by a side door. He is attempting to reach his horse and make a speedy escape.

<p>You can hear the guards eating their food as you walk back along the corridor towards the iron stairs. When you reach the bottom step, you wait here to allow the potion to take effect. After a few minutes you hear the guards’ anxious cries as their minds are filled with horrific images. You hear the ringing <i>clang</i> of metal striking metal, followed by screams of pain and terror. Then there is a loud crash followed by a lengthy silence. You hurry to the top of the steps and see the lifeless bodies of the guards lying heaped before the Rune Hall door. Convinced by the effects of the potion that their comrade was transforming into a monstrous enemy, they have both stabbed each other to death in a frenzy.</p>

Then there is a loud cracking sound and suddenly the crystal chamber collapses in an untidy heap. The rune located above it remains in position. It now hangs suspended in mid-air, but the column of dark mist that inhabited the core of the chamber swirls around the shattered remains like a small tornado. From its centre there comes a hideous shriek and a lance of fear stabs at your heart when suddenly you recall having heard this terrible sound once before. This dark shadow is Zorkaan the Soultaker, the entity that you encountered at the clearing in the Grochod Forest, the evil presence that you disturbed as it fed upon the psychic remains of the innocent Slovian prisoners slain and buried there.</p>

<p>With a growl of anger, the sergeant unsheathes his sword and points with it to a window of the gatehouse. ‘Lower the gate!’ he bellows. ‘And arrest them both, at once!’</p>
<p>You react instantly by slapping the rump of Delissa’s horse. This sudden shock sends it bolting towards the gate which has risen to little more than half its full height. Delissa presses herself flat against her horse’s neck and she clears the bottom of the gate with barely an inch to spare. You spur your horse forward and follow in her wake. Just as you and your horse clear the gate, it begins to fall. It crashes down behind you with a thunderous boom, and in so doing it prevents the sergeant and his men from giving chase.</p>
<p>As you gallop along the highway that heads north from Duadon, you hear the gatehouse alarm bell ringing out across the surrounding fields and copses.

They are clad in fearsome suits of black armour embellished with skulls and scarlet dragons, and their mounts are similarly protected by plates of burnished steel. They ripple like liquid fire in the light of the setting sun. Alerted by the alarm bell, these riders descend from the hillocks to converge upon the highway and block your path.</p>

<p>You take a deep breath before slipping over the side into the cold dark waters of the Quarl. The current helps to speed you along as you swim submerged towards the bridge, and when you are directly beneath its central span, you surface briefly to fill your lungs with air before continuing underwater.</p>
<p>When you are a few hundred yards beyond the bridge, you surface again and strike out towards the left bank. Your boat has collided with a pillar and the Eldenorans are so preoccupied with recovering it that they fail to see you climb out of the river and escape into the bordering trees. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the bridge, you stop to rest for a few hours in the comfortable bough of an oak tree. The night passes without incident and you awaken at dawn to the shrill sound of bird song. Through the thinning canopy of autumn leaves you can see a forest track which runs parallel to the river. A distant flicker of movement catches your eye and, when you magnify your vision, you see three riders approaching from the south. Two are armed and they wear the uniforms of Eldenoran cavalry scouts, but the third is clad in a tunic of scarlet and black—the colours of the Slovian army. His hands are tied and you suspect that he is a prisoner of war. The loss of your sailboat threatens to delay your journey downriver to Tekaro by several days. Mindful of this, you decide to ambush the approaching Eldenoran riders and capture their horses.</p>
<p>From the cover of the trees that border upon the track, you wait until the riders are close and then you draw upon your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to command their mounts to stop.

<p>The stifling furnace-heat of the workshop hits you like a hammer the moment you walk in. One of the craftsmen motions to you to wait a moment while he puts the finishing touches to a small glass bulb. The shelves are filled with hundreds of similar bulbs, and when you pick one up and examine it, you are shocked to discover it contains a volatile mixture of naphtha and phosphorus. The glassblowers are manufacturing phosphorus bombs for Vandyan’s army, and stacked upon their shelves are enough of these deadly incendiaries to raze a small town. (If you wish to take a Phosphor Bomb, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.)</p>
<p>Unsettled by what you have discovered here, you decide not to wait for the glassblower to finish his work. Instead, you hurry out of the workshop and return to the street.</p>

<p>You cut through the wall of Vorka and strike the rune with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your blade cleaves the evil stone in two. Then the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and you are thrown backwards to the floor as shards of broken stone whistle around you. When the rain of debris ceases, you pull yourself to your feet and look upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber. Pools of fire burn among the shards that litter the floor of the pit, and all the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>

<p>You pretend that you have not heard the sergeant’s request and you continue on your way. You hear the Eldenoran curse you and then a burning stub of firewood comes whooshing through the air. It narrowly misses you as it arcs over your head and hits the frosty ground, exploding with a splash of crackling sparks. The sergeant’s curses echo across the fields as you canter away from his campfire and head towards a distant ribbon of silver that is the River Storn, glimmering in the starlight.</p>
<p>Shortly you come to a highway that runs parallel to the Storn. You cross over this road and descend a bracken-covered slope towards the river’s east bank. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>

<p>As you enter the clearing, your Magnakai Discipline of Divination makes you aware that this place was recently the site of a terrible crime. You close your eyes and force yourself to concentrate, and slowly a host of terrible images takes shape in your mind’s eye. Beneath the soil of this clearing lie the bodies of a thousand Slovian prisoners of war. Captured when Tekaro fell, they were brought here by Eldenoran guards and murdered by the merciless Vorka. This clearing is the site of their mass grave and you can detect a strong psychic presence. Mostly it comprises a lingering residue formed by the souls of the innocent men who were murdered here, but there is also something else—something invisible yet wholly evil.</p>
<p>Your pulse races when you suddenly realize that this evil entity has come here to feed upon the psychic remains of the slain Slovian prisoners. You are now in its presence and your life is in grave danger.</p>
<p>Immediately you open your eyes and catch a fleeting glimpse of a dark shadow that is sweeping through the surrounding trees. You try to focus upon it but suddenly your head is filled with the blinding pain of a powerful psychic assault.</p>

Hulsta is shocked that the shop should be guarded by a dog and he apologizes to you for not having scouted it beforehand. ‘Forget it,’ you say, ‘I just hope there’re no more nasty surprises in store for us when we get to the tunnel.’</p>
<p>Cautiously you step over the guard dog and find yourself in a kitchen. You make sure that it is empty before you beckon Hulsta to enter and close the rear door behind him. Once inside, your guide moves quickly to another door and pulls it open to reveal a flight of steps leading down to the cellar below. Before he descends, he pauses to light his lantern and then he leads the way.</p>

<p>You draw upon your advanced Kai skills to mask your body scent as the first of the Vorka come rushing through the trees. Hungrily they descend upon your boat and they make short work of the provisions that they find hidden under its canvas. The few Vorka who arrive too late to share in this unexpected feast vent their anger on the boat itself. You are taken aback by the sheer speed and ferocity of their attack which reduces your sailboat to matchwood in less than a minute.</p>
<p>Silently you watch the Vorka as they return to the bridge and cross once more to the other side. The incident seems to have excited the Eldenoran guards, and you can hear them laughing and cursing wildly. You decide to wait until their excitement has died down a little before you attempt to leave your hiding place.

<p>You retrieve the Graveweed Concentrate from your pack and pour it carefully over the slices of cold meat.

<p>Over the course of the next hour, the traffic gradually decreases until the highway is empty of enemy wagons. At this time you approach the road and follow it towards the northwest. By noon, having covered more than 10 miles, you stop to gather a meal of wild berries that are growing along the banks of a stream. While you are eating, two riders approach you from the north. You magnify your vision and see that they are Eldenoran scouts; they are clad in uniforms similar to the one you are wearing. Immediately you look around for a place to hide until they have passed, but when you notice that they are now galloping directly towards you, clearly it is too late to hide: you have already been seen. You leave the stream and step out into the middle of the highway to wave a greeting as the riders approach. You trust this bold action, backed by your Kai Disciplines, will be enough to see you through.</p>
<p>The scouts rein in their mounts and regard you with suspicion. ‘Where’s your horse, trooper?’ asks the older scout.</p>
<p>‘He shed a shoe and went lame,’ you reply. ‘I’ve left him at a farmhouse, 10 miles yonder. I’m trying to get back to Duadon to report the loss.’</p>
<p>The younger scout casts a nervous glance at his older companion and you notice his right hand creeping towards his sword.</p>
<p>‘You’re a long way from your regiment,’ he says, accusingly. ‘Too far to be anything but a deserter…or a spy!’ And with this accusation ringing in your ears, the scouts unsheathe their swords and attempt to cut you down. You must fight them.</p>

<p>From the battlements of Skull-Tor there arises a shrieking wail. At first this terrible sound reminds you of the ghastly howl emitted by the Vaag when they were consumed by the raging storm, but then you look to the fortress and quickly you determine that this is no supernatural sound: it is an alarm siren. Shortly after the shriek of this alarm is heard, you see the portcullis rise at Skull-Tor’s North Gate. A troop of cavalry gallops forth, and you note that each trooper is carrying a burning torch in one hand and a Bor pistol in the other. Fear returns to chill your blood when you sense that you have been spotted from the battlements, and this troop of cavalry has been dispatched to ride you down.</p>
<p>You break into a run and race along the paved avenue towards the western flank of Cillan Square. As you near the corner you see the saddle-maker’s shop where you and Hulsta first gained entry to the tunnel below Skull-Tor. You are sprinting across the avenue towards an alleyway that runs alongside the shop when the cavalry comes bearing down on you from behind. The captain screams an order to his men to open fire and the thunderous report of their pistols explodes in your ears.</p>

<p>Hurriedly you draw upon your advanced Kai Discipline to conjure up a mist that engulfs both you and your mount. The Eldenorans are startled by the billowing vapours and they back away in confusion, giving you space in which to turn your horse about and gallop away into a nearby alley. As you race along this deserted passageway, you glance over your shoulder and see that the mist has now dissipated and the reeves are pursuing you. The alley turns to the right and comes to a dead end. Facing you is a three-storey townhouse with a balcony which overhangs a pair of stable doors. The lock is broken and so you pull open a door and urge your horse to enter the gloomy interior. Quickly you dismount in the darkness and wedge the doors shut with the shaft of a hammer you find discarded upon the straw-covered ground. Moments later you hear the echoing footfalls of the reeves as they come running around the corner. Their sergeant orders them to check the entrance of every house bordering the <i xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>. Two soldiers approach and the stable doors rattle when they push against them with the butts of their spears. You wait with bated breath, fearing they will try to force them open, but they are satisfied that the doors must be bolted from the inside and they move on to check the next house. After a few minutes you hear the soldiers leaving the square. Then a yellowy light flares up behind you, and you spin around to see an old woman standing in a doorway at the top of a short flight of stone steps. She is holding a lantern in one hand and a carving knife in the other.</p>
<p>‘You’ve no right to be here,’ she says, her voice wavering with fear. ‘Please leave…leave my home at once.’</p>

<p>The cooperage is stacked to the ceiling with barrels, kegs, vats, and casks. They form a wall around a broad-shouldered man with thinning grey hair who is busily fitting a hoop of metal to a new water butt. You approach him and ask if his name is Hulsta.</p>
<p>‘Aye, I’m Hulsta,’ he replies, wearily, ‘and you can go back to Captain Zharm and tell him that his barrels will be ready tomorrow at noon, like we agreed.’</p>

But the storm is reaching its peak above Skull-Tor, and soon he will summon the Vaag to enact his revenge upon you.

Bolts of lightning are striking at the very edge of the aperture now; it is only a matter of minutes before the Vaag will be released.</p>

<p>‘Very well, I’ll pay what you ask,’ you reply. The guards order the following riders and wagons to wait while they lower the portcullis and escort you away to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they intend to renege on the deal and throw you into a cell regardless, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: ‘Don’t worry, trooper. We’ll jus’ go somewhere private. We don’t want all o’ Duadon witnessing our business.’</p>
<p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall. Here you hand over the 10 Gold Crowns (erase these from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) and the guards unlock the door. It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city’s south wall. ‘Off y’go, trooper,’ says the tall guard, and he pushes you through the arched doorway.</p>
<p>The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. You leave the door and walk along the narrow alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the portcullis is raised and the flow of traffic has resumed. Wagons trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan’s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
<p>You recall Gwynian’s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city’s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that is heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately you soon discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you attempt to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square, to the east and west.

<p>You are four days out of Casiorn when, shortly after noon, the column reaches the outskirts of Quarlen. Many of the mercenary regiments of Anari, Firalond, and Kakush are encamped around its fortified wall and they give a rousing cheer when your banner is first sighted by their lookouts. Proudly Lone Wolf acknowledges their salutes as he leads the Kai through the town’s East Gate and along a wide street which descends towards the River Quarl. The column is signalled to halt when it comes to a large square, and quietly you await Lone Wolf’s order to dismount. This square is located close to the eastern approach to a wide stone bridge that no longer crosses the river, its central span having been destroyed to prevent the enemy from using it. Three Anarian officers arrive on foot and request that Lone Wolf and Gwynian accompany them to a nearby tavern where the mercenary commander, Lord Nathuro, has set up his headquarters. Lone Wolf agrees to their request, but before he goes he orders that you and your fellow Grand Masters secure good stabling and billets for the Kai in the buildings which border upon this square.</p>
<p>Within the hour, you have carried out Lone Wolf’s orders in full. Your own billet consists of a room above a tailor’s shop that you share with Bright Star, a friend and fellow Grand Master. You are preparing a meal when a messenger arrives with an order from Lone Wolf for all Grand Masters to join him at once at the Barrel Bridge Tavern—Lord Nathuro’s headquarters.</p>
<p>Upon entering the tavern’s spacious taproom, Lone Wolf immediately introduces you and your comrades to Lord Nathuro and his captains. A Council of War has already taken place and Lone Wolf has settled with Nathuro which of his regiments the Kai are to command. He hands lists of these units to Bright Star and the other Grand Masters, and then he orders them to go and inform the Kai of their command postings. You are wondering why you have not been handed one of these lists as you get ready to leave the tavern, but as you turn to go, Lone Wolf orders you to remain. Soon you discover why it is that you have not been allocated a regimental command.</p>

Along the left wall of this windswept hallway are tall arched windows that command a view of the parade ground surrounding the inner keep of Skull-Tor.</p>
<p>You recall Hulsta speaking about this keep shortly before his untimely death and, when you focus your Kai senses upon its imposing walls, you detect that it harbours the evil power that you have come to destroy. From the cover of the antechamber, you observe the keep and determine that entry to it can only be gained via a drawbridge which gives access to an archway located some 20 feet above the ground. To reach this bridge, you will have to ascend to the next level of Skull-Tor.

<p>Using the cover of the trees, you skirt around the stone bridge and then follow the river southwards. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans, you stop to sleep for a few hours in the comfortable bough of an oak tree. The night passes without incident and you awaken at dawn to the shrill sound of bird song. Through the thinning canopy of autumn leaves you can see a forest track which runs parallel to the river. A distant flicker of movement catches your eye and, when you magnify your vision, you see three riders approaching from the south. Two are armed and they wear the uniforms of Eldenoran cavalry scouts, but the third is clad in a tunic of scarlet and black—the colours of the Slovian army. His hands are tied and you suspect that he is a prisoner of war. The loss of your sailboat threatens to delay your journey downriver to Tekaro by several days. Mindful of this, you decide to set an ambush for the approaching Eldenoran riders to capture their horses.</p>
<p>From the cover of the trees that border upon the track, you wait until the riders are close and then you draw upon your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to command their horses to stop. They slow to a halt and, despite their riders’ stinging blows, they refuse to take a step further. Silently you unsheathe your Kai Weapon. As soon as the Eldenorans dismount, you leap from your hiding place and take them by surprise.</p>

<p>The guards glance at your wristband and nod their approval. They part their crossed spears and allow you to march out across the drawbridge, towards the open archway of the inner keep. As you reach the middle of the bridge, you look to your right and see plumes of black smoke rising up into the night sky. They originate from the chimneys of armouries located on the east side of Skull-Tor. Even at this late hour they are in full production, manufacturing an unending supply of weapons and armour for Vandyan’s Vorka hordes.</p>
<p>Upon entering the archway, you find yourself standing in a circular hall that is hung with tapestries and framed portraits. At a desk positioned in the middle of this hall sits an Eldenoran scribe who is busily writing in a ledger with a quill pen. He is so engrossed with his work that he does not acknowledge your presence in any way. Behind him you see a flight of stairs spiralling up to the floor above, and on either side of the entrance archway there are open portals which lead off to the left and right.</p>

<p>You make your way back to the mine entrance and then hurry away along the base of the ravine. Night is fast approaching and you have barely covered a mile when the ravine ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west you can see the outline of a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep, wooded valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the forest for several miles. There appears to be no easy way of avoiding the gorge, but you are unwilling to attempt a descent in the dark. Instead, you decide to find somewhere safe nearby where you can set up camp and await the dawn.</p>

<p>Quickly you locate the grating and Hulsta uses his dagger to dig out the grime that cements it in place. Once it is cleared, together you lift the grating away and peer down at the river flowing below. Hulsta is anxious about the depth of the water and so he ties a chunk of brick to the end of his rope and lowers it into the flow. When he withdraws it you are both relieved to see that the water here is little more than waist-deep. You are the first to enter the river, and then you take hold of the lantern to allow Hulsta to drop down behind you. Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus protects you from the water’s icy chill, but Hulsta is not so fortunate. He gasps with shock when he enters the water and you realize that he will not be able to tolerate its freezing temperature for more than a few minutes at most.</p>
<p>Mindful of your companion’s discomfort, you hand him back the lantern and then lead the way along this circular channel. You are peering at the rough-hewn ceiling, seeking out the next grating, when suddenly you feel something brush against your thigh. You glimpse a trail of bubbles and instinctively you pull away, tugging your weapon from its scabbard as you recoil. Moments later, the scaly head of a large black serpent breaks through the surface and rears up before your face. Its venomous fangs glint in the lantern-light and its forked crimson tongue flickers wildly, sensing prey. Hulsta cries out in alarm as the great black snake jerks back its head and narrows its ghoulish green eyes. It is getting ready to strike.</p>

<p>You recite the words of the spell and launch a bolt of energy that strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a loud <i>Crack!</i> and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as the evil stone is sundered in two. Moments later, the crystal chamber is torn apart and a terrible shriek assails your ears as the air is filled with hissing bolts of fire. Instinctively you turn away from the explosion and cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken crystal cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers. When this deluge ceases, you turn back and look with fearful expectation upon the devastated remains of the chamber. Flickering trails of green fire sputter and die among the scattered crystal shards, and the column of dark mist that inhabited its core now swirls around the debris like a small tornado. From its core there comes a hideous shriek and a lance of cold fear stabs at your heart when suddenly you recall having heard this terrible sound once before. This dark shadow is Zorkaan the Soultaker, the entity that you encountered at the clearing in the Grochod Forest, the evil presence that you disturbed as it fed upon the psychic remains of the innocent Slovian prisoners slain and buried there. The whirling shadow of Zorkaan gathers speed and, with a parting wail, it shoots upwards and disappears through the aperture in the hall’s domed ceiling, into the very eye of the raging storm.</p>
<p>The noise of the exploding bell-chamber and the hellish shriek of Zorkaan alerts Vandyan to your presence in the hall below. You see his face twisted with rage. He raises a glowing silver disc that is clasped tightly in the palm of his right hand, and then he spits out a vile curse that chills your blood.</p>

<p>As your horse tramples the angry reeves, desperately they thrust at you with their spears and wound you in the side: lose 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Tenaciously you fight to remain in the saddle despite the pain of your injury, and your horse carries you away from the yelling reeves and back to the main street. You draw upon your healing skills to mend your wound as you escape along the street and ride across the square that lies at its end. There are several exits from this square, but you choose the least-busy one to make your escape. This tree-lined avenue bears west towards Tekaro Cathedral. The Eldenorans have turned the city’s magnificent building into a dormitory for their troops, and as you pass by its grand doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers sleeping on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard your blood-spattered clothing with suspicion as your horse plods its way forward. Gently you urge him to increase his pace for fear that they may stop and challenge you.</p>
<p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls, you come to the city’s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at you and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. As the gate creaks open you ride through it and out onto the highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the shimmering waters of the River Storn and you follow it for a few miles before turning your horse away towards the river. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>

Hulsta pushes the heavy iron grill back into position to seal off the opening, and you counter your spell in order to avoid hitting the roof of the tunnel into which you have emerged.

<p>You run along a wide, low-ceilinged tunnel that is strewn with the corpses of Vorka, all of whom perished the moment you destroyed the rune which empowered their existence. The tunnel enters an armoury where furnaces now blaze unattended, and ends at a ramp that ascends to an open gate. Through this gate you glimpse the starry night sky and the rooftops of Duadon’s East Quarter. This is a welcome sight for it holds the promise of escape from Skull-Tor. As you reach the ramp you increase your pace and run swiftly towards the gate but, as you are nearing the top, your path is blocked by a hulking, blue-skinned giant. At once you recognize this creature to be an Ogron, a notoriously dull-witted breed but one much suited to hard labour. The Ogron who faces you now is an armourer and he is carrying a heavy double-handed warhammer. You order him to let you pass, but your command is angrily countermanded by Vandyan’s guards who have entered the tunnel behind you. They order the Ogron to attack you, and readily he raises his great warhammer and takes a swipe at your head.</p>

<p>Delissa has already prepared the route by which you can escape from Duadon. One of the ancient tunnels of Skull-Tor passes directly below the city’s North Gate and it emerges in the middle of a coppice less than a mile from the city wall. She and Hulsta found a way to enter this tunnel through the cellar of a warehouse located less than half a mile from the cooperage. Hulsta scouted the tunnel before you arrived in the city, but Delissa is anxious to ensure that the way is still clear now that Vandyan’s troops are out hunting for you.</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn, she leaves the cooperage to scout the surrounding streets. When she returns an hour later, you sense that she is anxious and disappointed.</p>
<p>‘Vandyan’s men have discovered the tunnel,’ she says, despondently. ‘They have sealed it off and posted guards around the building. The watch on the battlements and at the city gates has been trebled, and a reward has been placed on your head.’ She takes a scroll from her pocket and gives it to you. When you unfurl it you see your own face depicted upon the parchment. Below is printed the sum of 10,000 Gold Crowns, and the words: ‘For delivery of this man’s body to Skull-Tor. Dead or Alive’.</p>
<p>‘They are posted on every street corner,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘It is not safe for you to leave the cooperage—everyone is looking for you. Duadon is awash with rumour. The Vorka have perished and the Eldenoran army is in retreat. The citizens fear retribution at the hands of those who were overrun by Vandyan’s horde, and as for Vandyan himself, they say he has gone mad with rage. He has ordered his most feared troops—the Sinistrari—to return to Duadon at once to lead the hunt for you. They are riding from Luyen and will arrive tomorrow.’</p>
<p>Delissa insists that you remain hidden in the parlour over the next two days. She hopes that Vandyan may begin to believe that you fled Duadon immediately after your escape from Skull-Tor, and that you are no longer to be found in the city. Her reasoning seems to be borne out by a reduction in the number of guards she sees patrolling the streets at the end of the second day. But when the third day arrives, you can no longer afford to lie low and wait for Vandyan to release his iron grip upon this city. You must reach Xaitar’s Rock before nightfall in order to rendezvous with Guildmaster Banedon.</p>
<p>Now that the tunnel can no longer be used, you formulate a new plan to escape from Duadon by way of the city’s North Gate. Delissa prepares a disguise for you, using theatrical make-up and a wig, and she also creates a convincing story to explain your departure from the city. You are to play the role of her cousin, and the two of you will be leaving Duadon bound for Luyen in order to tend to Delissa’s sister who has suddenly been taken ill. It is a bold plan, and as the hour of your departure draws closer, you offer up a prayer to Goddess Ishir in the hope that she will grant it her blessing.

<p>When the other Grand Masters have left the taproom, Lone Wolf tells you of an important mission that he and Gwynian want you to undertake. Agents in the Eldenoran capital of Duadon have confirmed that the Runes of Agarash are being kept in the city’s stronghold, a daunting fortress called Skull-Tor. Lone Wolf wants you to travel alone to Duadon and make contact with Gwynian’s agents. They know a secret route into the fortress and they will help you to gain entry. Once inside, you must find and destroy the runes as quickly as you are able. Upon completion of this task, the agents will assist you to escape from Duadon and will take you to a place of safety.</p>
<p>‘This is a very dangerous mission, Grand Master,’ says Lone Wolf gravely, ‘yet it must be undertaken and it must be completed successfully if we are to rid the Stornlands of Vandyan and his foul Vorka hordes. It is the only key we have to a lasting victory. You have proved yourself to be brave and resourceful these past few months and I would not think ill of you if you were to decline this mission. But of all the Kai, I know that only you possess the inner strength and resolve to fulfil this vital task. Grand Master, will you accept the mission?’</p>
<p>The thought of venturing hundreds of miles behind enemy lines to undertake such a dangerous quest fills you with a sense of dread. Yet you feel greatly honoured to have been chosen for this mission and you do not flinch from your duty. ‘I accept, my lord,’ you reply firmly.</p>
<p>Gwynian, Nathuro, and the assembled mercenary captains all breathe a collective sigh of relief upon hearing your response. Lone Wolf smiles and nods his head. ‘So be it, Grand Master. The road ahead is sure to be a difficult one, but I am confident you shall prevail.’</p>
<p>Lord Nathuro and his officers salute you and bid you good luck, and then they leave the tavern and assist with the transfer of their regiments to Kai command. Lone Wolf and Gwynian bid you accompany them to an adjoining chamber where you are given further information about the mission. With the help of a <a href="#map">map of the Stornlands</a>, Gwynian shows you that the quickest route to Duadon is by way of the River Quarl. You are to travel downriver by boat to a place beyond the city of Tekaro where the Quarl flows into the great River Storn. Here, preferably at night, you must cross to the west bank of the Storn, abandon your boat, and then enter the Grochod Forest on foot. This is Eldenoran territory and Lone Wolf warns you that any persons or creatures that you encounter in Grochod Forest will most likely be hostile. Under cover of the trees, you are to trek north through the timberlands until you reach the southern approaches to Duadon itself. The city gate is likely to be guarded well, but you must enter without being seen.</p>
<p>‘Once inside Duadon,’ says Gwynian, ‘make your way to Flank Street. It is in the Northern Quarter. There you will find a cooperage, a barrel-maker’s shop, which is run by a man called Hulsta and his wife, Delissa. They are my agents and they are loyal to our cause. They are awaiting the arrival of a Kai and you may make yourself known to them by using the words: “A barrel made from Sommlending oak”. Be sure to use these exact words for they will respond to no others. Hulsta will show you how to enter Skull-Tor where you must locate and destroy the runes and escape as quickly as you are able. If you are successful, we shall know of it immediately. By breaking the runes you will extinguish the source of the power by which the Vorka are permitted to exist. When Vandyan’s fell army dissolves, we shall be able to raise the siege of Varetta and defeat any Eldenoran who dares remain upon Lyrisian soil.’</p>

The signpost bearing its name is topped by a brass badge shaped in the likeness of a setting sun, indicating that you are now entering Duadon’s West Quarter. You walk along Flank Wall, past the workshops of hatters, lamp-makers, and potters, until you come to a flagstoned square in the shadow of the city’s West Gate. An unending stream of wagons, each piled high with timber and iron ore, is pouring into the city through this gateway. They trundle across the square and along a wide thoroughfare called Corvayl Avenue which leads directly to Skull-Tor. You stop to look along this busy street and, through a hazy curtain of acrid smoke, you catch your first glimpse of the imposing arched entrance to Vandyan’s stronghold. It resembles the toothed and fleshless jaw of a huge shark.</p>
<p>Mindful of the emporium owner’s words, you resolve to avoid Skull-Tor and continue along Flank Wall. Yet in order to do so you must negotiate the heavy traffic that is trundling across the West Gate square.</p>

<p>You chase after the Eldenoran but you are unable to prevent him from getting away. As he gallops off into the darkness, you hope that he is too scared to return this night. When you return to the cabin you find Rouf being hugged by his uncle and aunt who are overcome with emotion to see their favourite nephew once more. Quickly Rouf explains that, despite your uniform, you are not an Eldenoran. When he then goes on to reveal that you are a Kai Lord on a secret mission, their eyes widen with awe. Prizo warns you that there are many Eldenorans in this area and that it is no longer a safe place. He invites you both to stay here this night but he says you must remain watchful. Reluctantly Prizo and his wife have decided to leave their home. They plan to cross the Quarl and seek shelter in Salony. Many Slovian refugees, including other members of Rouf’s family, have found sanctuary there in the Great Forest and they plan to join them.</p>
<p>You and Rouf take turns to keep watch during the night, and shortly before dawn you awaken his uncle and aunt. Fie prepares a delicious breakfast and while you are eating they discuss their plans. Rouf has decided to join his aunt and uncle and go with them to Salony. You tell them that you must continue with your mission and try to cross the River Storn near Tekaro. Prizo repeats Rouf’s warning that the city is occupied by the Eldenorans and encircled by Vorka regiments, but he also has some extra information that might be useful. He says that the Eldenorans have set up a military ferry on the Storn, five miles south of the confluence where the two rivers, the Quarl and the Storn, meet. In your disguise as an Eldenoran scout, you may find it is the easiest way to cross the river.</p>
<p>After breakfast, you thank Rouf and his kin for their help and you wish them luck on their journey to Salony. In return they thank you for freeing them and Fie offers you some food for the road ahead (enough for 2 Meals).

<p>The wheelwright is disappointed that you have not visited his shop on business. Impatiently he replies: ‘I don’t know. You’re looking for a street that’s way over on the north side of Duadon. Go left when you get to the watchtower and you’re in Flank Avenue. Maybe, if you follow it far enough, it’ll lead to Flank Street. I don’t know for sure.’</p>
<p>You thank the wheelwright and leave his shop. When you come to the watchtower at the end of Kettle Street, you turn left and enter Flank Avenue. A signpost bearing its name is topped by a copper badge shaped in the likeness of a galleon with billowing sails, indicating that you are now entering Duadon’s East Quarter.</p>
<p>You walk up Flank Avenue, past the establishments of moneylenders, wagoneers, and rope-makers until you come to a flagstoned square before the city’s East Gate. A column of scaly-skinned Vorka are marching across the square and out through the gate, accompanied by young fresh-faced Eldenoran officers on horseback. You stop to watch the Vorka and, when you look back along their ranks, you see a busy street which leads to the centre of the city. Lurking behind a hazy curtain of acrid grey smoke is the fortress of Skull-Tor, less than half a mile distant. It is from here that the Vorka are emerging. Like some foul discharge, they flow forth in green streams from the newly-constructed armouries that adjoin Vandyan’s grim stronghold.</p>
<p>You resolve to avoid Skull-Tor and continue along Flank Avenue in the hope that it may lead directly to Flank Street. When a gap appears between the marching ranks, you hurry across the square and press on towards the north of the city. Soon you come to a watchtower in the northeast corner of Duadon. Your spirits rise when you see a signpost surmounted by a silver star, for it indicates that you are about to enter the Northern Quarter.

<p>You draw upon your Discipline of Animal Mastery to calm the dog, and the effect is immediate and irresistible. He stops whining and starts licking your hand affectionately.</p>
<p>‘Well, I’ll be!’ exclaims one of the guardsmen.</p>
<p>‘You certainly must ’ave a way with dogs. Ol’ Bloodfang don’t normally take to strangers.’</p>
<p>The Eldenorans look at their suddenly playful hound and they shake their heads incredulously.</p>
<p>‘I’ve never seen him like this before,’ says one guard. ‘I’ve seen ’im bite a few hands off in his time, but I ain’t ever seen him lick one!’</p>
<p>Your control over this normally vicious hunting dog greatly impresses the guardsmen. One of them climbs the steps and he has to put a leash on the dog in order to drag him away from you. Delissa bids them goodnight as they file out of the rear gate, and when she is sure they have gone, she quickly returns to the parlour and locks the door behind her.</p>

<p>The old woman descends to the bottom step and snatches the coins from your palm (remember to erase the relevant number of Gold Crowns from the Belt Pouch section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>‘Very well, you can stay here,’ she grumbles, ‘but be sure you’re gone before daybreak, y’hear?’ Without waiting for you to reply, she scurries up the stairs with an impressive bout of speed and slams the door shut behind her.</p>
<p>It is a frosty night, but you sleep warm and well and leave the stable before dawn, just as the old woman requested. The alleyways and streets of this quarter are empty at this early hour, and you do not see any Eldenorans until you reach a tree-lined avenue that leads to the plaza of Tekaro Cathedral. Vandyan has turned this magnificent building into a dormitory for his troops and, as you pass by its open doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers asleep on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard you with suspicion as your horse plods his way slowly across the frosty plaza. Gently you urge him to increase his pace for fear that they may stop and challenge you.</p>
<p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls you come to the city’s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at your horse and uniform and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. The gate creaks open and quickly you ride through it and out onto a highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the River Storn and you follow it for five miles before you come to a wide cinder track, newly-laid by Eldenoran engineers to service their military ferry across the great river. You recall Rouf’s uncle telling you about the ferry and you decide to take a closer look. You steer your horse onto the cinder track and descend towards a large raft which is moored at the river. There are six Eldenoran guards on duty here, but none pay you too much attention. They all appear to be nursing hangovers this morning and none feel inclined to talk. You ride onto the raft and remain in the saddle as the flat-bottomed ferry is winched by rope and pulley across the Storn. As soon as it comes to a halt, you ride your horse up a wooden ramp and onto a road that has been cleared and levelled by the Eldenoran army through this part of the Grochod Forest. Once clear and beyond sight of the ferry, you leave this military road and enter the trees. The forest is too dense for you to traverse it on horseback and so you abandon your mount and continue on foot.</p>

<p>A piece of rock smashes into the planking near your feet. It tears a hole in the bottom of the boat and a spout of water gushes into the air to rain down upon your head. You are attempting to plug this leak with a knot of canvas when an arrow clips your shoulder and knocks you down: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>The Eldenorans cheer as your boat begins to founder. As it disappears from view beneath the centre arch, you hear their echoing footfalls as they rush across to the opposite side of the bridge to wait for it to reappear. When you emerge, the Eldenorans laugh and jeer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must abandon the boat. You turn the rudder towards the left bank and aim your sinking craft at a place where a copse of willow trees overhangs the river. As you pass beneath the branches, you clamber out and quickly take cover among the trees.</p>
<p>The Eldenorans soon arrive to search the boat and the surrounding area. They fail to discover you and silently you observe them from the undergrowth as they drag your half-submerged boat out of the water and sift through its meagre contents. When they tire of this, they return to their duties at the bridge. Once the coast is clear, you leave the copse and hurry away. Only when you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans do you dare stop to rest for a few hours in the bough of an oak tree.</p>

<p>You pull away from the Vorka and retreat towards the stairs. As you move, you unshoulder your Bow and draw an Arrow to your lips. For a few fleeting seconds you see the rune clearly, and this is all you need in order to be able to let loose your shaft with accuracy. The Arrow strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as it cleaves the evil stone in two. Instantly the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and you are blown back against the wall of the pit. Shards of broken stone whistle around you. When the rain of debris ceases, you pull yourself to your feet and look upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber. Pools of fire burn among the splinters that litter the floor, and all the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>

<p>You are nearing the northern perimeter of the forest when you stop for a few minutes to catch your breath. You look back towards the clearing, now more than a mile distant, and for a few fleeting moments your head is filled with screams of pain and the plaintive cries of innocent men begging for their lives to be spared. These terrible sounds drive cold spikes of despair deep into your heart, but your Kai senses swiftly override these feelings of hopelessness and suddenly you realize that the sounds are not real. They are a cruel illusion, an aural hallucination planted in your mind by the evil shadow-creature.</p>
<p>Fearful of its sinister powers, you hurry away through the trees. Soon you emerge from the Grochod Forest upon a grassy ridge and see before you a patchwork of ploughed and fallow fields stretching to the far horizon. You recognize this land to be the Demera Quilt, the cultivated farmlands and vineries south of Duadon. The cloudy sky is darkening as night approaches yet, when you magnify your vision, you are still able to catch a glimpse of Duadon itself. This grim city lies 30 miles away, towards the northwest.</p>
<p>As night draws closer, a cold wind arises and the heavy rains of the past few days return once more. Chilled by the weather and by your encounter at the clearing, you scan the landscape in search of somewhere dry to spend this night.

<p>As you strike the telling blow, Zorkaan emits a hideous shriek. The shadowy creature begins to shimmer and whirl like a raging cyclone, rising and fading in intensity. Then, with a last mournful wail, it shoots upwards and disappears through the aperture in the hall’s domed ceiling, into the very eye of the storm that rages overhead. You raise your Kai Weapon once more and run towards the rune that hangs suspended in the air, above the shattered remains of the crystal bell-chamber. With cat-like grace you spring into the air and strike the black stone a single devastating blow. There is a loud explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts when your blade cleaves the evil stone in two.</p>
<p>Vandyan is shocked to witness the defeat of Zorkaan and the destruction of his Vorka horde. But the storm is reaching its peak above Skull-Tor, and soon he will summon the Vaag to enact his revenge upon you. He cackles with mad glee as he raises into position the crystal saucer which contains the last remaining rune. Bolts of lightning are striking at the very edge of the aperture now; it is only a matter of minutes before the Vaag will be released. Desperate to prevent this calamity, you rush across the hall to an iron ladder that is bolted to the obsidian wall. It ascends to the edge of Vandyan’s raised platform. As you climb towards the storm-lit platform, you pray to Kai to give you strength enough to defeat this wicked foe.</p>

<p>Cautiously you step into the shop to find yourself in a kitchen. You make sure that it is empty before you beckon Hulsta to enter and close the rear door behind him.

<p>You draw upon your Discipline of Animal Mastery to subdue the dog, and the effect of your suggestion is immediate and irresistible. The dog stops growling and comes bounding towards you like a carefree puppy. You pat and stroke him, and he licks your hand affectionately.</p>
<p>‘Well I’ll be!’ exclaims one of the guardsmen. ‘You certainly ’ave a way with dogs. Ol’ Bloodfang don’t normally take to strangers.’</p>
<p>His companion looks at the playful hound and he shakes his head incredulously. ‘I’ve never seen him like this before,’ he says. ‘I’ve seen ’im bite a few hands off in his time, but I ain’t ever seen him lick one!’</p>
<p>Your control over the dog greatly impresses the two soldiers and they choose to forget about searching the parlour and its adjoining rooms. After a few minutes they put their dog on a leash and then they return to the yard. You stand in the doorway and watch as they, and four other guardsmen, make a thorough search of the barrels stored along the rear wall.</p>
<p>‘What’s all the fuss?’ you call out, much to Delissa’s surprise.</p>
<p>‘We’re looking for an enemy spy,’ retorts one of the soldiers.</p>
<p>‘He’s wearing a cavalry scout uniform,’ says another. ‘Have you seen or heard anything unusual tonight?’</p>
<p>‘No,’ you reply. ‘The storm kept us awake. We’ve heard nothing o’er that.’</p>
<p>The guards appear satisfied with your account and they call off their search. They bid you both goodnight and leave by the rear gate. When she is sure they have gone, Delissa quickly returns to the parlour and locks the door behind her.</p>

<p>You wait until you can count no more than a dozen Eldenorans. Then you leave the antechamber and march boldly along the hallway towards a grand staircase which ascends to the next level of the fortress. Keeping your head bowed to avoid eye contact with passing enemy officers, you reach the stairs and hurry up them to a landing on the floor above. As you approach this landing you see the entrance to the drawbridge away to your right. It is lit by lanterns and is guarded by two Eldenoran warriors who are sheathed from head to toe in shiny black plate armour. They stand on either side of the approach to the drawbridge with the shafts of their spears crossed to prevent anyone passing without their approval. An Eldenoran captain approaches the guards. He raises his right hand to reveal a leather wristband and they nod their assent. Briskly they withdraw their spears to allow the officer to cross over the drawbridge and enter the inner keep.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XV]</div>
<p>Upon reaching the top of the staircase, you turn to the left and walk away from the guarded drawbridge. You are looking back over your shoulder, your mind racing to think of a way to get across the drawbridge, when something hits you forcibly in the chest and brings you to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>Within the hour you arrive at a junction where the track leaves the forest and joins the beaten road that runs from Tido to Tekaro. This highway borders upon the seemingly endless expanse of the Slovarian Plain, a verdant grassland that stretches away into the far distance. You scan the rolling horizon, wary of the enemy, yet you see little there save for a few wild stallions.</p>
<p>You turn your horses towards Tekaro and ride on at a comfortable pace. As the morning unfolds, Rouf tells you something of the battles fought across the plains during the past weeks. ‘This is cavalry country,’ he says. ‘Fighting here is like warring upon the high sea. Swift movement and striking power are the keys to victory. We Slovians are great horsemen and great soldiers and long have we been masters of this land. Our generals boasted that we would destroy the plodding Eldenoran infantry on the open plain, but we had never before encountered the Vorka. Those demons have been our undoing. They can run like ravening wolves and fight as hard as any knight in armour. Alas, if only we knew how to destroy them…’</p>
<p>Rouf asks you about your mission but wisely you decline to give him any details. ‘It is not that I do not trust you,’ you say, sincerely, ‘but it is best you do not know. The Eldenorans are not above torturing their captives. If by chance you should be captured again, they will not make you tell what you do not know.’</p>
<p>During the afternoon you pass several Eldenoran riders bound for Tido. Some jeer at Rouf in passing, but none delay nor prevent you from continuing on your way. As night approaches, you reach a junction where a dirt track joins the road from the west. Rouf informs you that this trail leads to his uncle’s cabin in the woods. You follow the track for three miles until you reach a mound of stones topped by a wooden flagpole fixed with a ragged Slovian flag. When Rouf sees the flag he immediately signals you to halt.</p>
<p>‘Something’s wrong,’ he whispers. ‘That flag…it’s upside down. It’s a warning sign.’</p>
<p>Quietly you dismount and tether your horses among the trees before approaching the cabin on foot. It rests at the bottom of a shallow ravine and is surrounded by a number of smaller wooden outbuildings. Three saddled horses are tied to a rail beside the main cabin and, when you magnify your vision, you see that their saddles are identical to your own. They are Eldenoran army mounts. Cautiously you approach the cabin and peer in through a side window. Rouf gasps when he sees his Uncle Prizo and Aunt Fie, for they have been tied to chairs and placed back-to-back in the middle of the cabin. Three burly Eldenorans are looting their home and you can hear them threatening to kill them if they do not reveal where they have hidden their gold. The threats make Rouf’s blood boil. He urges you to help him attack the Eldenorans and save his kinfolk, but you are wary of rushing headlong into the cabin. Clearly the Eldenorans are worthless thieves and to attack them may endanger Prizo and Fie’s lives.</p>

<p>The Arrow strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your shaft cleaves the evil stone in two. The crystal chamber is torn apart and a terrible shriek assails your ears as the air is filled with crackling bolts of green fire. Instinctively you turn away from the explosion and cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken crystal cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers.</p>
<p>When this deluge ceases, you turn back and look with fearful expectation upon the devastated remains of the chamber. Flickering trails of green fire sputter and die among the scattered crystal shards, and the column of dark mist that inhabited its core now swirls around the remains like a small tornado. From its core there comes a hideous shriek and a lance of cold fear stabs at your heart when suddenly you recall having heard this terrible sound once before. This dark shadow is Zorkaan the Soultaker, the entity that you encountered at the clearing in the Grochod Forest, the evil presence that you disturbed as it fed upon the psychic remains of the innocent Slovian prisoners slain and buried there. The whirling shadow of Zorkaan gathers speed and, with a parting wail, it shoots upwards and disappears through the aperture in the hall’s domed ceiling, into the very eye of the raging storm.</p>
<p>The noise of the exploding bell-chamber and the hellish shriek of Zorkaan alerts Vandyan to your presence in the hall below. You see his face twisted with rage. He raises a glowing silver disc that is clasped tightly in the palm of his right hand, and then he spits out a vile curse that chills your blood.</p>

<p>You hide the bodies of the two scouts in some bushes that border upon the stream. Then you take one of their horses and release the other into a nearby field before setting off along the highway.</p>
<p>For two hours you ride past the farms, estates, vineyards, and hamlets of the Demera Quilt until you come within sight of Duadon. As you approach the city’s South Gate, you join a queue of wagons and riders who are waiting their turn to enter. To your left, you note a distant column of supply wagons that is approaching the city’s West Gate laden with ore and timber: raw materials for Duadon’s armouries. To the right, a seemingly endless file of Vorka march out from the East Gate towards the River Storn. You watch them closely and your Sixth Sense tells you that they are on their way to bolster the Eldenoran army that is besieging Varetta.</p>
<p>As you inch your way closer to the gate, you cast your eye across the city’s bleak perimeter walls and fortified watchtowers. Through the portcullised arch of the gatehouse, you catch fleeting glimpses of buildings swathed in clouds of soot-laden smoke. It is not a welcoming sight. Inside the perimeter defences, the city echoes to the perpetual <i>clang</i> of hammers and the roar of mighty furnaces. Under Vandyan’s command, Duadon has now become little more than a vast machine, a grand and terrible factory of war dedicated to the efficient manufacture of his conquering Vorka army.</p>
<p>At length your turn comes to enter the South Gate. Two armoured guardsmen step forward and demand to see your regimental orders. When you say that you have lost them, they become suspicious and order you to dismount.</p>
<p>‘Losing your orders is very careless of you, trooper,’ says the taller of the two guards, his rasping voice full of sarcasm.</p>
<p>‘Now, if you were to make it worth our while,’ says the other, slyly, ‘well, we might jus’ overlook your slipshod ways. What do you say?’</p>

The second guard enters the parlour from an adjoining room and he takes a tinderbox from his pocket with which he relights the candles. As they flare into life, the guard emerges from the closet with a self-satisfied grin fixed upon his cruel face. Your heart pounds when you see that he is holding your Kai Weapon.</p>
<p>‘I’ve found him!’ he bellows, and the six guardsmen who are searching the yard come racing up the stairs with their swords drawn. You fight bravely, and even though you are unarmed, you slay four of them before a heavy blow to your head knocks you out. Sadly, you never regain consciousness. Vandyan has placed a bounty of 10,000 Gold Crowns upon your head, payable upon delivery of your body to Skull-Tor, dead or alive. The surviving guardsmen decide to take no chances and callously they slay you while you are still unconscious.</p>

But when you finally reach the city itself, you sit up and pay close attention to its traffic of enemy troops and supplies. Your wagon joins a queue of other horse-drawn vehicles that are waiting to enter the city by its South Gate. To your left, you note a distant column of supply wagons that is approaching the city’s West Gate laden with ore and timber: raw materials for Duadon’s armouries. To the right, a seemingly endless file of Vorka are marching out from the East Gate towards the River Storn.

<p>You awaken shortly before daybreak to the bracing chill of a frosty morning. A pale half-light illuminates the river and surrounding landscape, and you cast your keen eye across it in search of enemy soldiers. Save for distant Tekaro and the Vorka horde encamped around its walls, you see no immediate threat and so you mount your horse and rejoin the highway heading south. After little more than two miles, you come to a wide cinder track that has been newly-laid by Eldenoran engineers to service a military ferry across the great river. You recall Rouf’s uncle telling you about this ferry and you decide to take a closer look. You steer your horse onto the track and follow it to a large raft which is moored at the river’s edge. There are six Eldenoran guards on duty here, but none pay you too much attention. They all seem to be nursing hangovers this morning and none feel inclined to speak. You ride onto the raft and remain in the saddle as the flat-bottomed ferry is winched by rope and pulley across the Storn. As soon as it comes to a halt, you ride your horse up a wooden ramp and onto a road that has been cleared and levelled by the Eldenoran army through this part of the Grochod Forest. When you are beyond sight of the ferry, you leave this military road and enter the trees.

Quickly you draw upon your healing skills to staunch the flow of blood from your wounded leg and, as the boat emerges, the Eldenorans give another cheer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must soon abandon the boat.

<p>The third tumbler clicks into position and the door swings open to reveal a vaulted corridor leading to a flight of iron steps.<sup><a href="#sect280-1-foot" name="sect280-1">11</a></sup> You enter, and the door closes silently behind you. There is a junction halfway along the corridor where another passage crosses from left to right. You hurry across and climb the metal steps but, as you are approaching the top of the stairs, you catch a glimpse of two armoured guards beyond. They are standing to attention before a large door that is engraved with mystic symbols. Your Sixth Sense detects that beyond this door lie the Runes of Agarash. Instinctively you duck below their line of sight, and then quietly you retreat to the junction. Here you detect the sound of footsteps approaching, and when you spin around to face them, you see a young kitchen attendant walking along the passageway towards you. He is carrying a tray laden with food and he stops abruptly when he sees you suddenly appear. Fearful that he may raise the alarm, you stride towards him and say in an accusing tone: ‘Why are you late, boy? Lord Vandyan has been kept waiting more than an hour for his food!’</p>
<p>‘But…but this is not for his lordship,’ answers the young man, clearly confused by your rebuke. ‘It’s for the guards at the door to the Rune Hall.’</p>
<p>‘What!’ you reply, feigning outrage. ‘You mean to say that you would put the feeding of two lowly guards before our master’s needs! This is intolerable!’</p>
<p>‘No…no…I mean, I was told by the cook to take this tray to the guards. Lord Vandyan ate a meal in his chambers some three hours ago. I’ve had no order to take him food since.’</p>
<p>‘Well, our master is hungry,’ you reply, ‘and you’d better go back to the kitchen and find him something suitable to eat this instant…if you value your hide, that is!’ Forcefully you snatch the tray from the bemused assistant, saying: ‘Go tell cook to prepare him something substantial, understand? He’s very hungry. I’ll deliver these scraps to the guards myself.’</p>
<p>The confused young assistant scratches his head and then he hurries away to deliver your order to the cook. You watch him until he turns a distant corner, and then you look down at the tray of cold meat and vegetables and an idea takes shape, an idea that may help you gain entry to the Rune Hall.</p>

At first the gaoler looks confused for he believes the lowest level of Skull-Tor is empty, but when you repeat your command he suddenly comes running along the corridor in response. In his haste he fails to see you, and as he scurries past, you strike him a blow to the back of the head which sends him tumbling all the way to the bottom of the stairs.

Having heard only one set of footfalls on the stairs, she already suspects that something is wrong. But as soon as she sees the sadness in your eyes, her worst fears are confirmed.</p>
<p>You comfort Delissa as best you can and assure her that Hulsta’s sacrifice was not in vain. ‘The Vorka have been destroyed and the Runes of Agarash have been shattered,’ you tell her, ‘yet without Hulsta, this vital mission could not have been accomplished.’ Your thoughtful words ease her sorrow, but before she has had time to grieve the loss of her husband, she is suddenly confronted by a threat to her own survival.</p>
<p>You can hear soldiers with dogs running along the alleyway behind the yard. You wait for them to disappear, but to your shocked surprise, they suddenly stop and bang on the rear gate and demand to be let in.</p>
<p>‘Quick! Go and change into some of Hulsta’s clothes. You’ll find them in there,’ she says, and she points to a closet door. ‘I’ll go down to the yard and try to get rid of them.’</p>
<p>You do as she says and quickly you discard your Eldenoran tunic and breeches. You bundle them together with your Kai journeyman clothes, and then you dress quickly in a shirt, breeches, and jacket that you find in the closet. The clothes are a little too large but you do not mind. Only when you pull on a pair of Hulsta’s boots do you thank Ishir that they are a perfect fit.

<p>The owner approaches and asks what you have to sell.

<p>You return to the main highway and ride south towards Tekaro. It is a dry, windy day and you spend most of it in the saddle. As you draw closer to the city, so the number of Eldenorans you encounter steadily increases. Fortunately, they are too preoccupied with their marching and other duties to spare a lowly horse-scout more than a second glance.</p>
<p>The sun has set and dusk is surrendering to darkness by the time you reach Tekaro. The rolling fields around this old walled city are swarming with Vorka regiments, and the fetid smell of their scaly hides gusts towards you on the chill night breeze.</p>
<p>You can see the cathedral spire of the city silhouetted against the starry sky, and a yellowy glow of torchlight radiates from a tower above its fortified North Gate. You magnify your vision and see that the gate itself is open and unguarded.</p>

<p>The Arrow strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your shaft cleaves the evil stone in two. Moments later, the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and instinctively you cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken stone cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers. When this deluge ceases, you look with fearful expectation upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber.</p>
<p>Pools of fire burn among the shards that litter the floor of the pit, and the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>
<p>The noise of the destruction and the hellish dying shrieks of the Vorka horde alert Vandyan to your presence in the hall below. You look up and see his face twisted with rage. He raises a glowing silver disc, clasped tightly in the palm of his right hand, and he spits out a vile curse that chills your blood.</p>

The spongy moss provides a comfortable bed and you are soon asleep, but within the hour you are awoken by a rolling boom of thunder. A storm has swept in from the west and it is now raining heavily, yet the canopy of pine branches above has kept you from getting wet. Unfortunately, the tall pines also act as efficient lightning conductors. You are struggling to your feet when suddenly a bolt of forked lightning strikes the top of the trees.

<p>You take off your Backpack and pull aside its flap to expose part of the bejewelled Chalice. The guards’ eyes fill with naked avarice when they glimpse its gem-encrusted gold, and they can barely contain their excitement. Quickly they wave the wagon through into the city and then order the following traffic to wait while they escort you to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they are going to confiscate the Chalice and throw you in a cell, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: ‘Don’t worry, friend. We’ll jus’ go somewhere private. We don’t want all o’ Duadon witnessing our business.’</p>
<p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall. You hand over the Tekaro Chalice (erase this Backpack Item from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) and the guards unlock the door. It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city’s south wall. ‘Off y’go, trooper,’ says the tall guard, and he ushers you through the arched doorway.</p>
<p>The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. You leave the door and walk along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed. They trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan’s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
<p>You recall Gwynian’s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city’s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that is heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you are about to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>

The third dial, however, is much harder to manipulate this way.

<p>At length you determine that the correct position of the third dial is the same as the answer to this following puzzle:</p>

<p>Soon the tunnel arrives at a junction where a wider passageway crosses it, running east to west.

You peer through one of these gratings and see the surface of an underground river rushing away towards the east.</p>
<p>A smiling Hulsta beckons you to follow as he sets off along the passage. He is confident that you are on the right course and he says that you will reach the lower level of Skull-Tor in a matter of minutes.

When it comes to within an arm’s length, you leap up from your hiding place and draw your Kai Weapon with one swift and fluid motion. You strike fast and hard, wounding the Vorka in the throat to prevent it from shrieking out in alarm. The wound is deep, yet the creature is remarkably resilient.

<p>Your blow is poorly timed and it glances harmlessly off the rider’s heavy black armour. As you gallop past, he lashes out at you with a spiked ball and chain and it clips the back of your head. A flash of white light engulfs your vision, and in the next instant, you feel yourself tumbling forwards into a yawning dark abyss.</p>
<p>The blow from your enemy’s weapon renders you unconscious and sends you spinning out of the saddle. You never regain consciousness. The Sinistrari bear down on you and ruthlessly they trample your helpless body beneath the hooves of their warhorses. Death is painless and instantaneous.</p>

As you approach the bank, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees that have been picked bare by the invading army.

Among bulging bags of silver Slovian Lune, ornate candlesticks, polished silver plates, and gemstones, you discover one item of greater value than all of the others put together. It is a golden Chalice set with rubies and emeralds. You examine it closely and venture a guess that it was stolen from Tekaro Cathedral. (If you wish to take the Tekaro Chalice, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.)</p>

Through a rent in the fabric you can see the bridge getting closer and carefully you trim the rudder to steer your craft towards its central stone arch.

You hear them running along the muddy bank, and then there is a loud splash when one of them dives headlong into the river.</p>

<p>Beyond the open portal you descend by ramp and stair to the floor of a large hall. It is ringed with marble pillars and its walls are draped with Eldenoran battle-flags. The centre of the hall is dominated by a large refectory table around which are huddled groups of Eldenoran officers. They are poring over charts and battle-maps which show the positions of their Vorka hordes and the defensive lines of the Freeland armies. Messengers come and go, delivering and collecting orders, and nobody seems to pay you special attention as you quietly pass among these high-ranking officers.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XVIII]</div>
<p>You are eavesdropping upon a conversation between two cavalry captains when suddenly there is a fanfare of trumpets. Immediately the officers and their aides cease all discussion and the hall comes stiffly to attention in anticipation of Lord Vandyan’s arrival.</p>

<p>Quickly you draw upon your advanced Kai Discipline to conjure up a mist that engulfs you and your immediate enemies. This disorients the Vorka just long enough for you to be able to reach the rune and strike it with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your blade cleaves the evil stone in two. Then the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and you are hurled backwards to the floor. Shards of broken stone whistle around you. When the rain of debris ceases, you pull yourself to your feet and look upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber. Pools of fire burn among the splinters that litter the floor of the pit, and all the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>

<p>The old woman tells you to approach the stairs. Slowly she descends to the bottom step and, as the light from her lantern washes over you, she scrutinizes your clothing and your features.</p>
<p>‘You have the face of a Northlander yet you wear the uniform of Vandyan’s army. What are you…a mercenary in his pay?’</p>
<p>‘No, ma’am,’ you reply, politely. ‘I’m no mercenary. I’m Sommlending, and though I wear this uniform I do not fight for Vandyan. I fight against him. If you will grant me shelter this night, you will be hastening the day when Tekaro is freed from Vandyan’s grasp.’</p>
<p>The truth and sincerity of your words touch her heart and readily she agrees to let you stay. She also gives you a meal of bread and meat and she provides some feed for your tired horse. You sleep well and leave her house before dawn to avoid being seen. The alleyways and streets of this quarter are empty at this early hour and you do not see any Eldenorans until you reach a tree-lined avenue that leads to the plaza of Tekaro Cathedral. The enemy have turned this magnificent building into a dormitory for their troops and, as you pass by its open doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers asleep on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard you with suspicion as your horse plods his way across the plaza. Gently you urge him on lest they should stop and challenge you.</p>
<p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls you come to the city’s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at your horse and uniform and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. The gate creaks open and quickly you ride through it and out onto a highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the River Storn and you follow it for five miles before you come to a wide cinder track, newly-laid by Eldenoran engineers to service their military ferry across the great river. You recall Rouf’s uncle telling you about the ferry and you decide to take a closer look. You steer your horse onto the cinder track and descend towards a large raft which is moored at the river. There are six Eldenoran guards on duty here, but none pay you too much attention. They all appear to be nursing hangovers this morning and none feel inclined to speak. You ride onto the raft and remain in the saddle as the flat-bottomed ferry is winched by rope and pulley across the Storn. As soon as it comes to a halt, you ride your horse up a wooden ramp and onto a road that has been cleared and levelled by the Eldenoran army through this part of the Grochod Forest. Once you are clear and beyond sight of the ferry, you leave this military road and enter the trees. The forest is too dense for you to continue on horseback, so you abandon your mount and continue on foot.</p>

<p>Using your Kai camouflage skills, you slip away from the departing crowd unseen and hide behind a pillar where you wait until the hall is empty. You then emerge and hurry across to the north door through which Vandyan made his exit. This door is locked and you quickly determine that it is held secure by a combination lock, whose dials are on the other side.

<p>Hulsta bids his wife a fond farewell and she, in turn, wishes you good luck and godspeed. During your absence she will make arrangements for your escape from Duadon to a place of safety. ‘May Ishir protect you both,’ she says, as she watches you descend the steps and walk across the yard to the rear gate.</p>
<p>Running along the back wall of Hulsta’s yard is an alleyway, one of a thousand such passages that weave around the main streets of Duadon like capillaries around veins. It is dark now, and the alleys are unlit, yet Hulsta leads you expertly through the maze of narrow passageways. Soon you arrive at the rear of a three-storey shop where Hulsta stops to peer over the rear wall.</p>
<p>‘This is the place I showed you on the plans,’ he whispers. ‘I came here three months ago to make sure that it’s still possible to get into the old tunnel from here. It is, although since then a problem has arisen. The shop has a new owner, a saddle-maker, and he is fiercely loyal to Vandyan. We must get into the cellar without his knowledge.’</p>
<p>Hulsta checks that the coast is clear, and then he climbs over the wall and unbolts the rear door to let you into the yard. You discover that the shop is closed; there are no lights and its solitary rear door is locked. Hulsta suspects that the owner has retired early to bed. You examine the door and detect that it is not bolted. It is secured by a simple mortise lock.</p>

<p>As you approach the door, your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that the chamber beyond is empty. Confident in your natural ability, you twist the iron handle and push against the heavy portal. Silently it swings open on well-oiled hinges to reveal an empty circular chamber. A large iron-rimmed chute is set into its stone wall, and when you examine this opening, your stomach turns. Its surfaces are smeared with traces of human blood. You can hear the distant sound of rushing water and suddenly you realize that this chute leads directly to the river which flows beneath Duadon. From its condition and location you conclude that this chute has a single, sinister purpose: it is used by the gaolers of Skull-Tor for the swift disposal of prisoners who die in their charge.</p>

<p>Quickly you gather your equipment and hurry back to the edge of the gorge in search of safer shelter from this ferocious storm. Through the sheeting rain you can see the rocky knoll. It is devoid of trees and undergrowth and offers no protection from the lashing rain, but when you magnify your vision you notice that beneath its jutting slate base there is a dry hollow.</p>
<p>You struggle through the mud and eventually you reach the hollow. Shivering and exhausted, you settle yourself down and attempt to sleep here while the storm rages unabated. Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Throughout the long night you are awoken several times by concussive booms of thunder that roll and reverberate along the gorge. For a while you sit up and watch the wild and terrible beauty of this ferocious storm, but the fatigue of your long day’s march cannot be suppressed for too long and you find yourself drifting off into fits of restless sleep.</p>
<p>It is an hour after dawn when you finally decide to leave the hollow and press on with your long trek north. The worst of the storm has now passed but the rains persist and they hamper your progress. During the morning of the third day you catch sight of a trail that bisects the forest, running north to south. The heavy rain has transformed this dirt trail into a quagmire and several Eldenoran army wagons, laden with weapons and supplies, have become bogged down in the gluey mud. The troops attached to these wagons have set up tents among the trees and, to avoid the risk of running into them, you make a short detour to the east before continuing northwards once more.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of the fourth day you stumble upon a clearing close to the northern perimeter of the Grochod Forest. The ground here is studded with sawn stumps and the soft soil is freshly turned, indicating that this area has only recently been cleared of trees. As you look across the clearing you feel a prickling sensation at the nape of your neck. It is your Kai Sixth Sense and it is warning you that this place harbours a sinister secret.</p>

<p>As you ride along the highway that heads north from Duadon, you see in the distance a pair of grassy hillocks. The highway passes between them before rising to a cultivated plateau which is crisscrossed with irrigation channels. You are drawing closer to the hillocks when you notice two units of armoured riders are stationed here, one unit on either side of the road. These horsemen are clad in fearsome suits of black armour, embellished with skulls and scarlet dragons, and their mounts are similarly protected by plates of burnished steel that shimmer like liquid fire in the light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>‘Sinistrari!’ whispers Delissa. ‘Ishir protect us!’</p>
<p>Coolly you steer your horse along the highway at a steady pace and pass beneath the watchful gaze of Vandyan’s élite troopers. The mounting tension draws beads of cold perspiration from your brow, but these enemy riders offer you no challenge and you are able to continue unhindered. As you emerge from the hillocks, you whisper to Delissa out of the side of your mouth. ‘Just keep riding…and don’t look back!’</p>
<p>It is not until you reach the safety of the plateau that you dare glance back over your shoulder at Vandyan’s horsemen, now five miles distant. Beyond them, silhouetted black against the darkening sky, you see the walls of Duadon and the domed peak of Skull-Tor. Now that you are safely beyond reach, you raise your fist and give voice to a defiant cry of victory.</p>

<p>You leave the ridge and trek across a ploughed field to get to a large barn, the closest of three outbuildings surrounding the remote farmhouse. You enter this barn through a rear door and discover that it shelters twelve milk cows, housed in stalls, and a few dozen chickens which are penned into a corner. You climb a ladder to a hay-loft where you discover a small store of milk, cheese, and eggs (enough for 2 Meals). You feel tired after your earlier ordeal in the Grochod Forest, and so you make a comfortable nest in the hay and settle yourself down for some much needed sleep.</p>
<p>You are awoken shortly before dawn by the sound of whistling. It is the farmer’s eldest son and he has risen early to milk the cows. Carefully you crawl to the ladder and look down to see the young man standing directly below. He is holding a pitchfork in his right hand and he is about to climb up the ladder. You pull away to avoid being seen and hurriedly you look around for another way out. The only other exit is a small loading door through which bales of hay are hoisted by line and pulley into the loft.</p>

<p>A great door in the north wall of the hall swings open and through it strides a lean and elegant man, clad in a flamboyant tunic of emerald and gold. He moves with the confident grace of an athlete, yet his true age is revealed by his sagging jowls and the loose folds of skin that hang down below his dark, malevolent eyes. The gathering of officers salute their leader, Lord Vandyan, and they applaud when he climbs the steps of a marble dais in readiness to deliver his address.</p>
<p>‘Varetta will be ours by midnight tomorrow!’ he announces, to a roar of approval. ‘The legions of Vorka that I have dispatched to Lyris will ensure this victory. The Kai have been sighted at Quarlen but we will entrap them. Our victorious armies will march north from Suentina and cross the Slovarian Range through the North Pass. We shall cut off their supply route to Casiorn and attack their defences at Quarlen from the rear. The Kai will have but two choices: to die in Quarlen or be forced north into the abyss of the Maakengorge.’ Upon hearing this, the Eldenorans cheer their arrogant leader and praise his martial skill. However, his ambitious strategy to defeat the Kai fails to impress you for you know that Lone Wolf will be prepared for such an eventuality. You think it more likely that Vandyan’s army will perish when it attempts to traverse the treacherous North Pass.</p>
<p>Vandyan raises his hand and motions for silence. As the cheering dies away, he continues his address. His plans for the defeat of the Kai have failed to impress you, but when he reveals his strategy for the conquest of all Magnamund, it is then that you feel an icy chill of fear run down your spine.</p>

<p>You take off your Backpack and pull aside its flap to expose part of the bejewelled Chalice. The guards’ eyes fill with naked avarice when they glimpse its gem-encrusted gold, and they can barely contain their excitement. They order the following riders and wagons to wait while they escort you away to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they intend to confiscate the Chalice and throw you in a cell, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: ‘Don’t worry, friend. We’ll jus’ go somewhere private. We don’t want all o’ Duadon witnessing our business.’</p>
<p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall.

It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city’s south wall. ‘Off y’go, trooper,’ says the tall guard, and he ushers you through the arched doorway.</p>

<p>Mentally you recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mind Charm</i> and command the grinning soldier to hurl his rock away from the boat. Obediently he complies with your psychic command and his missile splashes harmlessly into the river, several yards behind. As you glide beneath the bridge, you hear his comrades laughing and cajoling him for missing such an easy target.</p>

<p>You bring your Mastery of Grand Nexus into play and the lock readily clicks open. Pulling open the heavy iron door, you discover an unguarded antechamber which leads to an echoing hall. Along the left wall of this windswept hallway are tall arched windows that command a view of the parade ground surrounding the inner keep of Skull-Tor. You recall Hulsta speaking about this keep shortly before his untimely death and, when you focus your Kai senses upon its imposing walls, you detect that it harbours the evil power that you have come to destroy. From the cover of the antechamber, you observe the keep and determine that entry to it can only be gained via a drawbridge which gives access to an archway located some 20 feet above the ground. To reach this bridge, you will have to ascend to the next level of Skull-Tor. This will not be an easy task, for the hallway and the parade ground are swarming with Eldenoran officers and Vorka slaves.</p>

<p>Hulsta walks over to a bookcase and, from a secret compartment in its base, he takes out an ancient scroll. Delissa clears some space on a dining table and her husband carefully unfurls the yellowed parchment upon it.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XX]</div>
<p>‘One of my ancestors was an engineer who worked on the construction of Skull-Tor,’ says Hulsta. ‘These are his original plans—the only ones that remain in existence today.’</p>
<p>The parchment has faded with the passing of centuries, yet it still contains a wealth of information. Hulsta indicates the perimeter of the fortress’s inner keep, its great arch, and the location of several subterranean chambers. Of particular interest is the course of an underground river, which passes directly below the fortress, and a series of tunnels which connect Skull-Tor to remote parts of the city.</p>
<p>‘These passageways were constructed as escape routes for Prince Jiokara, the ruler who commissioned the building of Skull-Tor. Many have since been sealed off or have collapsed into the river, but there is one that still exists.’ Hulsta indicates its location on the map and you notice that it passes beneath the city’s Northern Quarter.</p>
<p>‘We can gain entry to this tunnel from the cellar of a building located on the corner of Cillan Square. I propose we go there tonight. I shall act as your guide and I will take you into Skull-Tor by this route. Once we have gained entry, you must complete your mission alone. I will stay in the tunnel and await your return. Then I shall bring you out of the tunnel and escort you to a safe place where we can await the arrival of the victorious Freeland armies.’</p>
<p>You voice your approval of Hulsta’s plan and he smiles. He is glad to have been given the chance to contribute to the downfall of the tyrant Lord Vandyan whom he despises. Before you set off, he excuses himself for a few minutes so that he may change out of his working clothes. While he is getting dressed, Delissa suggests that you may wish to visit their workshop.</p>
<p>‘We have many tools,’ she says. ‘There may be some that would be useful during your mission. You’re welcome to take whatever you wish.’</p>

<p>You run headlong through the pines, desperate to put distance between yourself and the nameless horror that feasts upon the souls of the slain. Yet your swift escape is greatly hampered by thorny undergrowth and muddy ground, and by the exposed roots of trees that are wound round with claw-toothed briar. You are forcing your way through a tangle of dense foliage when you catch your foot on an exposed root. Suddenly the ground seems to disappear beneath your feet, and you lurch forwards to tumble head-over-heels to the bottom of a steep gully.</p>

<p>As Vandyan’s vile curse echoes around the hall, the procession of Vorka that are streaming from the bell-chamber suddenly slows to a halt. As if awakening from a walking sleep, they rub their eyes and take stock of their surroundings; then they come swarming towards the iron steps. They are quickly joined by others of their kind who pour back into the pit from the archway on the far side. These Vorka are armed with bladed weapons, and beyond the archway you glimpse the armoury whence they have returned.</p>
<p>As the first swarm of unarmed Vorka come lurching and scurrying up the steps, you realize that you must act quickly to stop them if you are to save yourself from being crushed by this reptilian horde.</p>

The only “Flank” I know is Flank Wall. That’s at the end of the lane. You go right when you get to the watchtower and you’re in Flank Wall.

<p>You intone the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <i>Invisible Fist</i> and hold out the palm of your right hand, directing it towards the Eldenoran thief as he climbs onto his horse. You feel a surge of tingling power leap from your palm and shoot towards his back. This invisible ball of concussive energy strikes him hard, spinning him out of his saddle with the force of its impact. He hits the ground head-first and you hear a bony <i>Crack!</i> echo in the darkness as his neck snaps beneath the weight of his loot-laden body. Limply, the Eldenoran rolls over and lies still, his robbing days are over for good.</p>

<p>You spin around and reach instinctively to your Weapon, but you stay your hand when you realize that you have collided accidentally with a young Eldenoran herald. The bumbling messenger stutters an apology. Then he drops down onto his hands and knees and attempts to retrieve the maps and scrolls that he was carrying, which are now scattered across the floor. As he gathers up his papers, you notice that he has a leather band attached to his right wrist.</p>
<p>‘Oh dear,’ he whines, ‘I’ll be late, and Captain Dvedka hates to be kept waiting. He’ll throw me in the d-d-dungeons. He promised he w-would the last time I was l-late.’</p>
<p>You help the herald gather his documents and, by the use of your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you remove his wristband and pocket one of his maps without his knowledge. (Record the Skull-Tor Wristband and Battle-map on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as Special Items. You need not discard any other items in their favour if you already possess the maximum number permissible.)</p>
<p>The hapless young herald thanks you for your assistance and then he hurries away towards the drawbridge. You watch him approach the guards and, after a brief altercation, you see one of them reach to a bell that is fixed to the parapet of the drawbridge. He rings it once and, within a matter of seconds, a troop of six guardsmen comes running out of a doorway that stands across from the entrance to the bridge. You hear the herald protesting his innocence as they escort him away to the guardroom. As soon as they have disappeared from view, you fix the leather band to your wrist and take the map from your pocket. Then you approach the drawbridge with a purposeful stride, and raise your right hand to show your Wristband as you come to within a few feet of the armoured guards.</p>

<p>The cellar is filled with the overpowering stench of tannic acid, a fluid used by the saddle-maker to convert his raw animal hides into leather. Hundreds of gallons are stored here in stout wooden casks that line the walls. Hulsta hurries past them to the southeast corner of the cellar where he drops to his knees. Carefully he places the lantern down on the floor and then he runs his hands lightly across the surface.</p>
<p>‘Ah, here it is!’ he says, locating something hidden beneath the dirt. He unsheathes a dagger and scrapes at the encrusted grime to reveal the outline of an old trapdoor. With your help, he prises open this hinged iron cover to reveal a dark shaft. You can hear the distant sound of water, and when Hulsta lowers his lantern into the opening, you see the floor of a passage less than eight feet below. ‘This is the tunnel,’ he says, excitedly. ‘It’s exactly as shown on the plans.’</p>
<p>Hulsta drops through the opening and you pass him the lantern. Then you enter the shaft and pull the trapdoor down behind you. It slams shut with a resounding <i>clang</i>.</p>
<p>This gloomy tunnel echoes to the far-off sound of rushing water and the occasional squeak of rats. Hulsta leads the way and you follow in his footsteps, taking care not to scrape your head against the low, mould-encrusted ceiling.</p>

<p>You are awoken several times during the night by explosive booms of thunder that roll and reverberate along the gorge. For a while you sit up and watch the wild and terrible beauty of this ferocious storm, but the fatigue of your long day’s march cannot be suppressed for too long and you find yourself drifting off into fits of restless sleep.</p>
<p>It is an hour after dawn when you finally decide to leave the dry hollow and press on with your long trek north. The worst of the storm has passed but the rains persist to hamper swift progress. During the morning of the third day you catch sight of a trail that bisects the forest, running north to south. The heavy rain has transformed this dirt trail into a quagmire and several Eldenoran army wagons, laden with weapons and supplies, have become bogged down in the gluey mud. The troops attached to these wagons have sought shelter among the trees and, to avoid running into them, you make a short detour to the east before continuing northwards once more.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of the fourth day you stumble upon a clearing close to the northern perimeter of the forest. The ground is studded with sawn stumps and the soft soil is freshly turned, indicating that this area has only recently been cleared of trees. As you look across the clearing you feel a prickling sensation at the nape of your neck. It is your Kai Sixth Sense and it is warning you that this place harbours a sinister secret.</p>

<p>The volley of lead shot whistles past you to smash the windows and tear stone from the walls of the saddle-maker’s shop. You sprint the last few yards and, as you enter the welcoming darkness of the alleyway, you look back over your shoulder and give thanks to Ishir that the riders were not armed with cavalry crossbows. Bor pistols are notoriously inaccurate, especially when fired from the saddle, and you are not greatly surprised to have survived all thirteen of the pistol balls that were just discharged at your back.</p>

<p>‘Ishir be praised! My prayers have been heard!’ yells the Slovian prisoner gleefully when his captors are felled by your deadly blows. As you step over their bodies and approach him, he leans forward in his saddle and holds out his hands, inviting you to cut through the rope that is wound tightly around his wrists.</p>
<p>‘My eternal thanks, sire,’ he says, as you sever his bonds. He then jumps down from his horse and offers his hand in friendship. ‘My name’s Rouf,’ he says, and a wide smile cracks his dark, travel-grimy features. ‘Those Eldenoran curs captured me on the plain east o’ Tekaro two days past. I was left behind to spy on their movements when my regiment pulled back to Suentina. Seems we may have somethin’ in common, you and I. We’re both operatin’ behind enemy lines, eh?’</p>
<p>The jovial Slovian helps you to hide the dead Eldenorans in the dense undergrowth. During this task he asks if you are a mercenary from Casiorn. When you tell him that you are a Kai, his jaw drops open with amazement. ‘A Kai Lord…here in Slovia! Ishir be praised. Perhaps we shall win this war after all.’</p>
<p>You confide in Rouf that you are on a secret mission and that you must reach the River Storn near Tekaro as soon as you can. Now that your sailboat has been destroyed by fire, you have little option but to continue by horse. Rouf offers to help but he warns you that the city of Tekaro has fallen to the Eldenorans. They occupy the city and have thousands of their Vorka encamped outside its walls. From Tekaro they have been sending reinforcements to their armies fighting across the Slovarian Plain and along the River Suen. This whole region is alive with enemy patrols and it will be difficult for you to avoid them on your way to the Storn. Rouf suggests that you wear one of the dead Eldenorans’ uniform, and that he accompany you upon the road to Tekaro, posing as your prisoner. His uncle lives in the forest near the River Quarl, a day’s ride from here, and that is where he wants to go now that he is free.</p>
<p>You agree to his plan and swap your Kai journeyman clothes for the uniform of a dead Eldenoran scout. (You stow your own kit in your Backpack, which requires space equal to two normal items. If your Backpack is full, you must discard two items to create sufficient space for your Kai Clothes.) Having changed uniform, you mount one of the Eldenoran horses and ride with Rouf back along the forest track heading south towards Tekaro.</p>

<p>You inspect the vials closely and your advanced Kai skills help you to determine that the strange jelly-like substances contained within these glass tubes possess strong psychic properties.</p>
<p>You cannot accurately gauge the strength of these psychic potions, but you are able to determine their effects. The contents of the Red Vial, when swallowed before psychic combat, will increase your mental defences. The contents of the Blue Vial will boost your psychic attacks. The contents of the Yellow Vial, however, will reduce the effectiveness of your psychic defences and could render you especially vulnerable to mental assault.</p>

<p>It is nearly dark when you enter the hills and ride with Delissa to your rendezvous at Xaitar’s Rock. Within minutes of arriving at this spire of weathered granite, you see a thin sliver of light in the darkening sky. You magnify your vision and your heart skips a beat when you see that this sliver is the sleek metal hull of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>—Guildmaster Banedon’s wondrous flying ship—fast approaching from the southwest.</p>
<p>Banedon brings his vessel to a halt directly above the spire of rock. Then a landing cage is winched down and a young Toranese crewman beckons you and your companion to step inside. Your stomach flutters as the cage is hoisted up to the deck of the flying ship where the Guildmaster himself is waiting to greet you and congratulate you upon the success of your mission.</p>
<p>Within minutes of your arrival aboard, a new route is charted and <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> is set on course for the city of Varetta. The journey by air takes little more than two hours and, although darkness has fallen, Banedon has little difficulty locating the city. Its siege-damaged walls are ringed with beacons of fire that are visible from 50 miles. As you draw closer, you see the lifeless remains of the Vorka horde spread out across the plain surrounding Varetta, and the regiments of the Freeland Alliance marching proudly towards the city gates. The beacons guide Banedon’s craft towards the centre of the city where it is made to hover above the Halls of Learning. Swiftly you are lowered by cage to the grounds of this magnificent building where the New Order Kai are encamped. You are greeted by the thunderous cheer of your fellow kinsmen, and the proud embrace of Lone Wolf and Gwynian the Sage. It is a joyful and victorious reunion, one that will live forever in your memory and in the legends of the New Order Kai.</p>
<p>News of your arrival spreads quickly through Varetta and you are fêted by its grateful citizens. By your brave action, the cruel siege of their city was lifted. Following a night of celebration, Lone Wolf orders you to return in triumph to the Kai Monastery aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> the next day. He will ride home with the New Order and arrive with them in a week’s time. Gladly you obey your leader’s command, and shortly before noon you wave farewell to your proud brothers from the deck of Banedon’s magnificent flying ship.</p>
<p>Early the next day, you arrive at the Kai Monastery and deliver the glad news of your victory at Skull-Tor. Warmly the defenders praise your achievement and listen in awe when you recount the details of your perilous mission. You inform them that Lone Wolf and the Kai crusaders are returning from Varetta and will arrive at the monastery one week from today. You are now the highest ranking Kai present at the monastery and so you take charge and oversee preparations for their welcome home.</p>
<p>Five days pass and the preparations are completed ahead of schedule. Everyone is looking forward with eager anticipation to their return. It is late in the afternoon when a Kai scout named Gold Rain arrives unexpectedly at the monastery. His face and clothes are badly travel-stained, and it is clear from his state of near-exhaustion that he has ridden hard without rest. You are hoping that he brings glad tidings, but you soon learn the contrary. Gold Rain has grave and shocking news to impart.</p>
<p>You learn that Lone Wolf has disappeared. During an overnight encampment on the outskirts of Ruanon, your leader was abducted. Those who witnessed the abduction said that Lone Wolf was engulfed by a whirling black shadow that fell upon him from out of a stormy sky. So swift was the attack that your fellow Grand Masters were unable to prevent him from being carried away.</p>
<p>A cold chill runs down your spine when you listen to Gold Rain’s report. His description of the whirling black shadow is identical to the form adopted by Zorkaan the Soultaker. You are filled with a gnawing sense of doubt, a fear that the destruction of the rune used by Vandyan to summon Zorkaan did not bring about the fell creature’s demise. Instead, it has trapped Zorkaan on Magnamund. Immediately you suspect that Lone Wolf’s abduction is an act of revenge. Your Sixth Sense tells you that Lone Wolf is still alive and present somewhere upon Magnamund, but you cannot determine where that place is.</p>
<p>You have achieved a great victory at Duadon, but the shocking news of Lone Wolf’s disappearance casts a shadow of doubt over your triumph there. You fear that the loss of your illustrious leader is too high a price to pay for the defeat of Vandyan and his Vorka hordes. Your natural instinct is to do everything in your power to find Lone Wolf and release him from his shadowy abductor. But this will be a great and difficult task, one that is sure to test your bravery and skills to the limit. If you have the courage and resolve of a true Grand Master, the challenge of finding and freeing Lone Wolf awaits you in the next exciting adventure, entitled:</p>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document.

<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>

That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

<p>If, in consequence of court judgement or the laws of a particular area, any portion of the License is held as invalid or unenforceable in any particular circumstance, you are no longer granted any rights under the terms of this License in that circumstance. You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>

<h4><a name="lic-5-0">5.0</a></h4>

<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
