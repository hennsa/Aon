 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>Lone Wolf has been abducted by the forces of the Dark God Naar and imprisoned in a remote city-fortress on the border of the Darklands. Subjected to relentless attacks by the minions of evil, the Supreme Master of the Kai is surely doomed to die unless a rescue can be effected swiftly and successfully.</p>

   <p>In <strong><cite>Trail of the Wolf</cite></strong>, you must venture alone into the dreaded stronghold of Gazad Helkona to find and free your leader. Can you succeed in your vital mission…or will you fall foul of the horrors that lurk within this Darklands city-fortress?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai—the warrior élite of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>It is autumn of the year MS 5083, thirty-three years after the First Order of the Kai was nearly wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. Lone Wolf, the leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS 5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>
<p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>
<p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace has reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS 5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents have helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you have risen swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>
<p>In the year MS 5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf’s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King’s Army of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>During the six years that have elapsed since the defeat of his minions, Naar has endeavoured to enact his vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and they wait quietly in the shadows for the day when they may serve their fell master. One such agent was Lord Vandyan of Eldenora. Guided by Naar, Vandyan sought and found three ancient runes of evil. Empowered by his discoveries, Vandyan summoned a vast army of reptilian warriors—the Vorka—and he used them to conquer and occupy the lands of his peaceful neighbours. Emboldened by his martial successes, Vandyan then carried the war further afield.</p>
<p>By mid-summer of this year his army had overrun much of central Magnamund, including the realm of Lyris—one of Sommerlund’s oldest allies. From war-torn Lyris there arrived at the Kai Monastery an old man called Gwynian the Sage. He was a learned scholar and was revered by the Kai for he had aided Lone Wolf on many occasions in the past. He entreated your leader to help save his country from Vandyan’s horde. Without hesitation, Lone Wolf pledged to mount a Kai crusade to raise the siege of Varetta, its capital city.</p>
<p>The Vorka had been the key to Vandyan’s military successes and he had a seemingly endless supply of these reptilian fighters. In order to defeat Vandyan and save Lyris, Lone Wolf knew that he had to cut off Vandyan’s supply of Vorka reinforcements at their source. Gwynian had agents in Duadon, the capital of Eldenora, who had sent word that thousands of Vorka were being created inside the city. This was the source of the enemy’s horde.</p>
<p>Gwynian’s agents in Duadon had confirmed that Vandyan’s runes were being kept in the city’s stronghold, a daunting fortress called Skull-Tor. Lone Wolf asked you to travel alone to Duadon to make contact with Gwynian’s agents. They knew a secret route into the fortress and would help you to gain entry. Once inside, you were to find and destroy the runes as quickly as possible. Upon completion of the mission, the agents would assist you to evade Vandyan’s troops. The thought of venturing hundreds of miles behind enemy lines to undertake such a dangerous quest filled you with a sense of foreboding. Yet, you also felt greatly honoured to have been chosen for the mission and you did not flinch from your duty.</p>
<p>Your journey to Duadon was fraught with many perils, yet you overcame them all and made contact with Gwynian’s agents. With their help you gained entry to Vandyan’s stronghold of Skull-Tor and destroyed the evil runes, thereby extinguishing the source of the power by which the Vorka horde were permitted to exist. Vandyan’s army dissolved and the Kai were then able to enter Lyris and raise the siege of Varetta.</p>
<p>During your mission in Skull-Tor, you discovered that the Vorka were not the only creatures that Vandyan had summoned by the power of the runes. A demonic entity called Zorkaan the Soultaker had also been brought to Magnamund from his lair upon the Plane of Darkness—the ethereal domain of Naar. Having fought and defeated this creature, you believed that he had perished forever when subsequently you smashed the runes. Sadly, this was not so.</p>
<p>Following your victory at Skull-Tor you were met by Guildmaster Banedon, the leader of Sommerlund’s Guild of Magicians, who spirited you away from Duadon aboard his flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. Within minutes of your arrival aboard, a route was charted and a course set for the city of Varetta. The journey by air took little more than two hours and, although darkness had fallen, Banedon’s skilled crewmen had little difficulty locating the city. Its siege-damaged walls were ringed with beacons of fire that were visible for fifty miles. As you drew closer, you saw the lifeless remains of the Vorka horde spread out across the plain surrounding Varetta, and the regiments of the allied armies marching proudly towards its gates. The beacons guided Banedon’s craft towards the centre of the city where it was made to hover above the Halls of Learning, Gwynian’s home. Swiftly you were lowered by cage to the grounds of this magnificent building where the New Order Kai were encamped. There you were greeted by the thunderous cheer of your fellow kinsmen, and the proud embrace of Lone Wolf and Gwynian the Sage. It was a joyful and victorious reunion, one that will live forever in your memory and in the legends of the New Order Kai.</p>
<p>News of your arrival spread quickly through Varetta and you were fêted by its grateful citizens. By your brave action, the cruel siege of their city had been lifted. Following a night of celebration, Lone Wolf ordered you to return in triumph to the Kai Monastery aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. He chose to ride home with the New Order and was expected to arrive in a week’s time. Gladly you obeyed your leader’s command, and shortly before noon you waved farewell to your proud brethren from the deck of Banedon’s magnificent flying ship.</p>
<p>Early the next day, you arrived at the Kai Monastery and delivered the glad news of your victory at Skull-Tor. Warmly the garrison praised your achievement and listened in awe when you recounted the details of your perilous mission. You informed them that Lone Wolf and the Kai crusaders were returning from Varetta and would arrive at the monastery in seven days’ time. You were the highest ranking Kai present at the monastery and so you took charge and oversaw preparations for their welcome home.</p>
<p>Five days passed and the preparations were completed ahead of schedule. Everyone was looking forward with eager anticipation to their return. It was late that afternoon when a Kai scout called Gold Rain arrived unexpectedly at the monastery. His face and clothes were badly travel-stained, and it was clear from his state of near-exhaustion that he had ridden hard without rest. You were hoping that he had glad tidings, but you soon heard to the contrary; Gold Rain had grave and shocking news to impart.</p>
<p>You learned that Lone Wolf had disappeared. During an overnight encampment on the outskirts of Ruanon, your leader had been abducted. Those who witnessed the abduction said that Lone Wolf was engulfed by a whirling black shadow that fell upon him from out of a stormy sky. So swift was the attack that your fellow Grand Masters were unable to prevent him from being carried away.</p>
<p>A cold chill ran down your spine as you listened to Gold Rain’s report. His description of the whirling black shadow was identical to the form adopted by Zorkaan the Soultaker. You were filled with a gnawing sense of doubt, a dire fear that the destruction of the rune used by Vandyan to summon Zorkaan did not bring about the fell creature’s demise. Instead, it had trapped Zorkaan upon Magnamund. Immediately you suspected that Lone Wolf’s abduction was an act of revenge. Your Kai Sixth Sense told you that Lone Wolf was still alive and present somewhere upon Magnamund, but you could not determine exactly where that place was.</p>
<p>You had achieved a great victory at Duadon, but the shocking news of Lone Wolf’s disappearance cast a deep shadow over your triumph there. You feared that the loss of your illustrious leader was too high a price to pay for the defeat of Vandyan and his Vorka hordes. Your natural instinct was to do everything in your power to find Lone Wolf and release him from his shadowy abductor, but you knew not where to look.</p>
<p>Hurriedly you dispatched a rider to Toran and summoned Guildmaster Banedon to an emergency council at the Kai Monastery. He responded swiftly to your summons and arrived within hours aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. He was accompanied by Lord Rimoah of Dessi, an Elder Magi magician who is also Lone Wolf’s oldest friend and advisor.</p>
<p>Rimoah confirmed your suspicions that Zorkaan had been summoned to Magnamund by the power of the runes. When you smashed the runes, this entity could not return to the Plane of Darkness from whence it had come. Inadvertently, your action had trapped Zorkaan upon Magnamund. The arrival upon your world of this powerful creature of evil had not gone unnoticed by the Elder Magi. From afar they had sensed Zorkaan’s presence and, through the use of their Old Kingdom magic, Rimoah and his fellow elders had charted his movements. For a short while, following the destruction of the runes, the creature had roamed the planet freely. But his freedom was soon curtailed.</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah then told you of an evil sorcerer called Xaol. He is a necromancer who dwells in hiding in Gazad Helkona, a former Darklord city-fortress located in the desolate wastes of northern Skaror. Xaol is also an agent of Naar who, since the demise of the Darklords, has patiently awaited the chance to serve his fell master. During the days before Lone Wolf’s abduction, Rimoah and the Elder Magi detected streams of psychic communication coursing between Gazad Helkona and the Plane of Darkness.</p>
<p>‘Naar was transmitting to Xaol the secrets of a Ritual of Binding by which the freed spirit of Zorkaan could once again be enslaved,’ said Rimoah. ‘We now know that this ritual was enacted successfully by Xaol in the stronghold of Gazad Helkona.’</p>
<p>‘Naar’s insatiable thirst for revenge is a menace that Lone Wolf has had to live with since the day he destroyed the Dark God’s champions,’ said Guildmaster Banedon. ‘He maintains his vigilance against the constant threat of assassination by the agents of Naar, yet it seems he’s been caught off-guard during the long march home to Sommerlund.’</p>
<p>‘Through the ritual enacted by Xaol, Naar has gained control over Zorkaan,’ replied Rimoah. ‘He sent this creature to assassinate Lone Wolf at a Kai encampment near Ruanon, yet the attempt was unsuccessful. Zorkaan failed to kill Lone Wolf…but he was able to subdue and abduct him.’</p>
<p>‘So where is Lone Wolf now?’ you asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>‘He is imprisoned in Gazad Helkona,’ replied Rimoah, ‘and he is in great peril. Only his Supreme Master Disciplines and the power of the Sommerswerd, his magical blade, have spared him from death by the hand of Naar’s foul creation. Your leader is brave and resourceful, but I fear that Zorkaan’s frequent attacks will weaken and eventually destroy Lone Wolf unless he is rescued quickly.’</p>
<p>Selflessly you volunteered to attempt such a rescue. Rimoah and Banedon were impressed by your courage and your confidence, and readily they agreed to help you achieve this difficult task. Rimoah informed you that Gazad Helkona is occupied by Xaol and his cohorts, which comprise Hammerland bandits and remnants of the army of Darklord Chlanzor, the former ruler of this city-fortress.</p>
<p>‘The stronghold is located in a remote volcanic region, surrounded by a petrified forest from which it takes its name. It is a difficult place to reach and assault by force,’ said Rimoah.</p>
<p>‘But where an army may fail, a single Kai may triumph,’ interjected Banedon, wisely.</p>
<p>At length you discussed the rescue and agreed upon a plan of action. Banedon will transport you aboard his flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> to a valley in the Shezar Hills, situated fifty miles to the south of Gazad Helkona. Here you will disembark and then approach the fortress on foot. Banedon will remain aboard his flying ship, safely out of sight of Xaol’s lookouts, where he will await a telepathic signal from Lone Wolf to confirm his rescue. Upon receiving this signal, he will bring <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> into the centre of Gazad Helkona in order to collect you both. If you are unable to complete your mission to set Lone Wolf free, you must make your own way back to the flying ship.</p>
<p>During your mission, Lord Rimoah and the Elder Magi will use their combined powers to disrupt the channel of communication that exists between Naar and his agent Xaol. Rimoah is confident that this action will serve to prevent Xaol from detecting the arrival of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>, and it will also help to keep secret your approach to his grim stronghold.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>) and physical stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 32). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21–24), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to this adventure.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>
<h3><a name="kainame">Your Kai Name</a></h3>

<p>It has long been the tradition of your élite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year’s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
<p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

<h4><a name="nodispln">New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines</a></h4>

<p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor—Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf—you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>
<p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which you begin the <cite>New Order</cite> series, means that you are skilled in the use of <em>one</em> of the weapons listed below.</p>
<p>For every adventure that you complete successfully in the <cite>New Order</cite> series while possessing the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery, you will gain proficiency with one additional weapon.</p>
<p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 points to any number you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.</p>
<h5><a name="anmlmstr">Animal Mastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.</p>
<h5><a name="deliver">Deliverance <em>(Advanced Curing)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, while in combat, their <small>ENDURANCE</small> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. This emergency ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
<h5><a name="assimila">Assimilance <em>(Advanced Invisibility)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of one to three days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques which make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.</p>
<h5><a name="hntmstry">Grand Huntmastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and they possess great natural speed and agility. They also have a superb sense of touch and taste. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p>
<h5><a name="pthmnshp">Grand Pathsmanship</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by hostile plants. Also they have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.</p>
<h5><a name="kaisurge">Kai-surge</a></h5>

<p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, New Order Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (Kai-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously). New Order Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>
<h5><a name="kaiscrn">Kai-screen</a></h5>

<p>During psychic combat, New Order Grand Masters are able to construct mind-fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="nexus">Grand Nexus</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to withstand contact with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="gnosis">Telegnosis <em>(Advanced Divination)</em></a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far fewer ill effects. Duration of the spirit-walk and the protection afforded to his inanimate body increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="magi">Magi-magic <em>(Old Kingdom Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of Old Kingdom battle-magic. These arcane skills include the use of basic Old Kingdom Spells, such as <i>Shield</i>, <i>Power Word</i>, and <i>Invisible Fist</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="alchemy">Kai-alchemy <em>(Brotherhood Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf and Guildmaster Banedon (the leader of Sommerlund’s Guild of Magicians), you have mastered the elementary spells of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells include <i>Lightning Hand</i>, <i>Levitation</i>, and <i>Mind Charm</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Brotherhood magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="astrolgy">Astrology</a></h5>

<p>The celestial bodies which occupy the skies above Magnamund have long been known to affect the lives of its inhabitants. Mastery of this Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to predict and shape the future by studying the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the myriad planets and stars. The number and accuracy of these predictions increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="herbmst">Herbmastery</a></h5>

<p>Mastery of this New Order Discipline enables a Grand Master to identify readily any substance derived from living or growing organic material. He is aware of any secret uses to which an organic material may be put, and he is skilled in effecting the release of a substance’s medicinal and/or magical properties.</p>
<h5><a name="element">Elementalism</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. By drawing upon individual elements that are available, or combinations thereof, he is able to detach, affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove, or accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, e.g. create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove air, intensify fire. The versatility of this Discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="bardsman">Bardsmanship</a></h5>

<p>Through mastery of this Discipline a Kai Grand Master of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of legend, mimic speech or dialect, and stimulate a wide range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect and power of his bardic abilities will steadily increase as he advances through the Grand Master ranks.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 25 of the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series, you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in Book 26. For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original five Disciplines you begin with, you may add 1 point to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> score and 2 points to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original five Grand Master Disciplines, your Kai Weapon,<sup><a href="#discplnz-1-foot" name="discplnz-1">2</a></sup> and any other Special Items and Backpack Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>New Order</cite> adventure, which is called: <a href="../lw/26tfobm.htm#title"><cite>The Fall of Blood Mountain</cite>.</a></p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you leave the Kai Monastery and begin your journey to Gazad Helkona, you equip yourself with a <a href="#map">map of that territory</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>New Order</cite> adventures (Books 21–24), you may add this sum to the number of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Axe (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Quiver (Special Items) This contains six Arrows; record them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />

</li>
</ul>
<p>List the five items that you have chosen on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the appropriate headings, and make a note of any effect that they may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points and/or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="kaiweapn">Kai Weapons</a></h4>

<p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the élite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>
<p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a href="#action">Special Items List</a>.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe ‘Alema’.</p>
<p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you were to use ‘Alema’ in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of +7 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> would remain at +5.</p>

<h4><a name="howuse">Equipment—How to use it</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct Weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this Weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful Weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is best to equip yourself also with a close combat Weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is 12.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai Weapon</dt>
<dd>Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal Weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This is in addition to the bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your five Disciplines, then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Gazad Helkona is the Gold Crown. These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.<br /><br />
</dd>

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
You, Grand Master (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. You also possess the Kai Weapon ‘Ulnarias’, so you add an additional 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This gives you a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 45.<br /><br />
You now subtract the Wild Dogs’ <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45−31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself—Grand Master.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>You (GM) lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
<li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of New Order Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>New Order</cite> series, you will gain an additional Grand Master Discipline and progress towards the pinnacle of Kai perfection—to become a Kai Supreme Master.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">New Order Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>The success of your mission to find and free your illustrious leader is one of vital importance. Lone Wolf’s abductor is a powerful and formidable adversary, and your search will be fraught with danger at every turn. Be wary and on your guard at all times during your exploration of Gazad Helkona.</p>
<p>During your search, some of the material items that you will encounter will be of use to you, but some may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items during your mission, be selective in what you choose to keep. Pick your five Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1–24) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>
<p>Grand Master—may the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir guide you safely during your mission.</p>

<p>You decide to begin your air voyage to the Shezar Hills at first light the following day. In the few hours which remain before dawn, both you and Banedon make final preparations for the long journey west. You summon to your chambers Winter Oak, a Kai Archmaster, and tell him of the mission you are about to undertake at daybreak. He is the most senior member of the garrison and you place him in command during your absence. The Kai crusaders are expected to arrive in two days’ time, and it will be his duty to inform them of your whereabouts and to keep the monastery safe until you and Lone Wolf return.</p>
<p>Having completed your preparations, you sleep for a few hours and rise shortly before dawn. Lord Rimoah escorts you to the monastery training park where, hovering above, you see the sleek hull of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> glinting in the moonlight. Rimoah has chosen not to accompany you on the voyage. Instead, he will remain here at the monastery and maintain contact with Banedon by means of a seeing stone. One of the ship’s lookouts sees you crossing the park below and he orders a boarding cage to be lowered from the stern deck. As you wait for it to touch the ground, Rimoah takes from his pocket a sigil of platinum fixed upon a loop of braided twine. He presses the amulet into your hand and insists that you wear it at all times.</p>
<p>‘It is an artefact imbued with Old Kingdom magic,’ he says, sagely. ‘It has protective powers that may help you when you enter Gazad Helkona. Lone Wolf possesses a similar sigil, and I am sure that it has helped him to resist Zorkaan thus far.’</p>
<p>You accept the sigil and slip its braided noose over your head. (Record this Platinum Amulet on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you wear around your neck. You need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>

<p>The nearest bandit tugs at his sword. You beat him to the draw and lunge at his chest with your Kai Weapon, running him through. He sways on his feet, his knuckles white on his sword hilt; then his strength fades and he keels over backwards onto the hard stone floor. The wolfhound yelps and runs off, but the remaining bandit stands his ground.</p>
<p>‘Prepare to die, raven-bait!’ he spits, as he unsheathes his heavy blade from its leather scabbard.</p>

<p>The Drakkar drops his sword and crashes to his knees. Groaning in agony, his gauntleted fingers scrabbling uselessly at your feathered shaft, he topples backwards and tumbles down the stairs, felling his comrades like skittles as he careers through their ranks. The few who are not bowled over by their leader immediately open fire at you with their crossbows, forcing you to dive for cover behind the parapet. As you crouch beside Lone Wolf, a sudden shriek echoes across the observatory platform, making you glance over your shoulder in fearful anticipation.</p>

<p>You focus on the trio of bandits in the hall beyond as you muster your formidable psychic powers. A ball of glowing energy slowly takes shape in your mind. When you feel that you can contain it no longer, you launch it at the bandits in three rapid bursts. The men cry out in pain as your psychic attack cuts deeply into the fabric of their minds, leaving them shocked and stunned. Before they can fully recover, you kick open the iron door and burst into the hall with your Kai Weapon raised to strike.</p>

<p>‘Thank Ishir you saved us from that hellish device, Sire,’ you gasp, and wipe away the cold sweat that has beaded upon your brow. ‘I fear I could not counter it.’</p>
<p>The boarding cage is winched up through an aperture in the stern deck of the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> and, as it shudders to a halt, the gate is pulled open. Eager hands help you and Lone Wolf out onto the deck, and Guildmaster Banedon salutes you from his position at the ship’s helm. All along the port and starboard rails, his young crewmen are firing at the swooping Kraan with bows and Bor pistols. Their unerring marksmanship soon decimates the enemy’s squadron and forces the survivors to abandon their attack. Banedon pulls the helm hard about and, with a resounding cheer from his victorious crew, the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> soars over the fortified wall of Gazad Helkona and speeds away towards the east.</p>

<p>Beyond the landing lies the entrance to a foul-smelling chamber, its floor littered with bones and scraps of rotting meat. Its walls are embellished with bas-reliefs showing demonic heads and bestial faces, with several humanoid creatures dancing in the background. They are partnered by scaly serpents that rise up from fissures in a volcanic landscape. To the right of the chamber you can see the remains of a granite altar that has been split asunder by some great force. Its riven fragments lie heaped before the entrance to a shadowy alcove. To the left, you see a black iron door with a peephole drilled near its centre. On the floor beside this door is a large wooden chest.</p>

<p>After several minutes of intense effort, the lock opens with a dull <i>Clunk</i>! Carefully, you push open the door and enter a spacious chamber that is lit by ten globes of flickering white light. They hang suspended in the air with no visible means of support. The walls of this chamber are plastered and decorated with murals that depict the armies of Darklord Chlanzor despoiling the farms and cities of the Freeland Alliance. Standing against the far wall is a throne-like chair, crudely fashioned from a huge block of black marble. Veins of fluorescent purples and greens colour its surface, and the air around it shimmers like a desert haze.</p>
<p>As you approach this chair, you hear the door slam shut behind you. Instinctively you spin around and you see that there is no lockplate on the inside of the chamber door. Its surface is plastered and entirely smooth; it blends in seamlessly with the painted walls.</p>

<h3><a name="sect11">11</a></h3>

<p>Warily you explore this narrow tunnel, and as you advance deeper into the darkness, you detect the sickly aroma of mould and decay. Bones crunch beneath your boots and the walls become thickly coated with a pallid grey moss. At length you are brought to a halt when the passage arrives at a dead end. You examine the mossy wall ahead, and your tracking skills help you to uncover a loose brick that conceals a length of rotting cord. You tug this cord and it triggers a hidden counterweight that causes the whole wall to revolve on a central hinge. Squeezing through the narrow gap, you enter a dark chamber that lies beyond. A few moments later, you hear the cogs of the counterweight resetting. Then the secret panel revolves about its hinge and locks behind you.</p>
<p>Using your infravision, you scan your surroundings and discover that you have entered a hall that is flanked on either side by a row of human skeletons. They stand at attention with their spines pressed against the stone wall, and clasped in their bony hands are rusty polearms of differing type and origin. At the far end of this hall, you can see a pair of stout wooden doors reinforced with strips of polished steel. Cautiously you advance under the sightless gaze of the flanking skeletons, and upon reaching the doors you discover that they are secured by a combination lock. A single dial with a brass pointer is mounted upon a circular plate that is numbered 0 to 200 around its bevelled edge. You place the palm of your hand against the door, and a tingle of excitement runs down your spine when you sense that Lone Wolf is being held captive on the other side of these doors.</p>
<p>With the help of your Kai Sixth Sense, you determine that the number which will open the combination lock is the same as the solution to the following puzzle.</p>
<p>If A=1, B=2, C=3 (and so on through the alphabet until you reach Z=26), what is the total numerical value of the fortress of ‘Gazad Helkona’?</p>
<p class="puzzle">When you think that you have calculated the total, turn to the section of this book that is the same as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect11-1-foot" name="sect11-1">4</a></sup></p>

<h3><a name="sect12">12</a></h3>

<p>The dial clicks into its correct position,<sup><a href="#sect12-1-foot" name="sect12-1">5</a></sup> and the concealed section of the wall creaks open to reveal a dark and narrow passage. You enter this secret tunnel and ascend a long stone ramp to a wider section of the passage, lit faintly by a strange ochre glow. This murky light radiates from clumps of bacteria that are thriving on the dank walls.</p>
<p>At once you recognize the bacteria to be Gnallia, a benign bacillus that is often used to prevent and cure infections of the blood. The raw bacteria are edible and rich in protein, and there is sufficient here for 5 Meals. If you wish to keep some of this Gnallia, record it in the Meals section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. Each Meal of Gnallia will restore 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>At length the passage comes to an end at a narrow door. At your approach, this portal slides open to reveal a winding stone staircase. You step out of the passageway and, as you turn to climb the stairs, you hear the portal sliding shut behind you. Cautiously you ascend the steps until they come to an end at a circular landing.</p>

<p>You use your Magnakai Curing skills in an urgent attempt to restore Lone Wolf to consciousness. You unbutton the front of his battle-tunic and place your hands on his chest; then you transfer the warmth of your healing powers directly into his body (this use of your Discipline costs you 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). After a few minutes you feel his heartbeat growing stronger, yet before you can complete the healing procedure, you hear the daunting sound of steel-shod boots echoing up the shaft from below. You risk a glance over the parapet of the stairs and you see a dozen armoured Drakkarim emerging from the tunnel at the base of the shaft. As they come running up the stairs, you see that many of them are armed with loaded crossbows.</p>
<p>Reluctantly you are forced to abandon your attempt to revive Lone Wolf. You heave him across your shoulder and take to the stairs once more, climbing as fast as your aching legs will carry you both towards the observatory roof, 60 feet above.</p>

<p>You leap over the bodies of the slain Drakkarim who lie entwined at the bottom of the tower stairs. Anxious that their discovery could lead to your capture, you drag them away from the steps and bundle them into an empty storage cupboard located under the stairs. As you are closing the cupboard door, you notice an iron key hanging from a peg driven into the wall.

<h3><a name="sect16">16</a></h3>

<p>You look across the steel platform and your eye falls upon a bronze statue of Darklord Chlanzor, partially hidden by one of the observatory’s roof supports. A bold idea leaps into your mind and you scurry over to the statue and stand behind it. The rotund likeness of Chlanzor is top-heavy, and when you barge into it with your shoulder, it topples over and rolls towards the stairs. Hurriedly you give it another hefty shove, and it barrels down the steps towards the startled assault trooper.</p>

<p>You strike the Krorn a powerful blow in the middle of its forehead with the toe of your boot, and send it spinning backwards into the chamber. With a muffled groan, it slides down the grimy wall, leaving a trail of bloodied gruel smeared in its wake.</p>
<p>Having incapacitated the tower lookout, you squeeze through the arrow slit and jump down into the chamber. The moment your feet touch the flagstones, you hear a high-pitched squeak somewhere above your head. You glance up and a shadowy blur flashes before your eyes. It is followed almost immediately by a sharp stabbing pain that runs all the way from your neck to your stomach. Something small and furry has attached itself to the flesh beneath your jaw, and it is feeding hungrily on your blood.</p>
<p>Instinctively you take hold of the creature with both hands and crush it in a vice-like grip. You hear its bones crack and you feel it go limp, and then you detach it carefully from your neck and hurl its lifeless body to the floor. A wave of nausea wells up in the pit of your stomach and you feel your punctured neck begin to swell alarmingly. Your Magnakai Discipline of Curing slows the effect of the creature’s venom, but you have been gravely weakened by this unexpected attack and you feel barely able to remain standing.</p>

Beyond the door you discover a pillared hall, its circular walls bedecked with battered shields and torn banners captured in battle. In the oily glow of a sputtering lantern you see two Drakkarim seated at a wooden table in the middle of the hall. They are playing dice and neither warrior notices you enter.</p>
<p>Quietly you close the door and then hide behind one of the pillars which encircle this hall. Beyond the Drakkarim, you can see an archway in the opposite wall which leads to a flight of stone steps. This appears to be the only other exit from the hall and you resolve to reach it without being seen.</p>

The giant spider gives chase, yet you are able to evade him with ease when he quickly becomes entangled among the twisted boughs and wire-hard bracken.</p>
<p>For three hours you hurry through the dead forest without pausing for rest. It is not until the dusty ground eventually gives way to broken and rocky soil that you are forced to slow your pace. The distant eruptions of the Kokozritzaga volcanoes seem louder now, and the constant ground tremors have become steadily stronger. You are about to stop and rest for a few minutes when suddenly a violent tremor shakes you off your feet.

An evil laugh echoes in your mind as slowly the wispy mass of black vapour spirals down towards your face. Desperately you lash out at your mocking adversary, but you lose your balance and collapse to your knees.

<p>The object you have touched is a cursed crown, an implement of torture crafted by Darklord Chlanzor’s Nadziranim—his evil magicians. This cursed crown was used by the Nadziranim to extract information from the Talestrians shortly before their deaths. The images you see and the pain that you feel are fragments of the terrible ordeal that the Talestrians were made to suffer before their demise: lose 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

With gasps of disbelief, the bandits scramble for their swords as they rise to meet your advance. The youngest of the trio is a sweaty-faced youth with lank ginger hair. He lunges at you with his rusty rapier but you sidestep his clumsy stroke with graceful ease. Then you retaliate with a thrust that pierces his thigh, and the youth grunts in agony as his leg buckles beneath him.

You take hold of Lone Wolf and lift him across your shoulder; then you pull open the wooden door and leave Xaol’s chambers as fast as you are able.</p>

<p>Swiftly, you spin around to see that a large section of the ground has opened up like a great trapdoor. From its subterranean lair, a colossal black spider hoists itself out of the ground and perches on the lip of the dark aperture. Swivelling on jointed legs, this titanic arachnid clacks its fanged maw as it fixes you with a cluster of crimson eyes that rotate and pulsate hypnotically.</p>

You draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen to counter the seductive effect of the spider’s hypnotic power, and at once the creature senses your resistance.

You suspect that this luckless animal was taken from the foothills of the Ogshezar Mountains, near the Skarorian city of Cragmantle, for this hardy breed of ruminants are common there. When you leave the carcass and approach the crushed remains of the second body, your stomach churns when you recognize its scaly, bat-winged form. It is a Kraan, a vile breed that was spawned and used by the Darklords to provide flying mounts for their Giak and Drakkarim armies. Darklord Zagarna mustered many thousands of these beasts when he invaded Sommerlund, and it was their assault by air which resulted in the destruction of the Kai Monastery. Some of the Kraan survived the fall of Helgedad and the demise of their Darklord masters, and you think it likely that this one has come from Gazad Helkona and was out scouting for food.

<p>The narrow bridge arcs towards the citadel platform, but its smooth span is broken in the middle by a hinged drawbridge. It is open and it hangs down, creating a gap at the apex that is 15 feet wide. You observe that this banded iron flap is operated by two heavy chains that run beneath the span. You magnify your vision and trace their route back to the base of a plinth which stands on the blockhouse platform, close by the entrance to the bridge. A winch handle protrudes from this plinth, but when you attempt to crank the chains taut, you find that it will not budge: it is locked in position.

<p>Hurriedly you drag the corpses of the dog and the Drakkarim into the dark alcove from where the Akataz first emerged. When you look around the floor of this shadowy niche, you discover a carpet of flea-infested sacking which you use to cover the bodies of your slain foes. Once they are hidden, you turn and hurry towards the stairs.</p>
<p>At the top of these steps you discover a wide balcony and a door banded by criss-crossing strips of enamelled iron. The door is ajar, and the grey half-light of Gazad Helkona filters through its opening to illuminate the gloom of an entrance hall that lies beyond. Cautiously you enter the hall and cast your eye over its dank walls and high ceiling.</p>
<p>The circular walls of this hall are bedecked with battered shields and torn banners, captured in battle during the Darklands War. Lit by the oily glow of a solitary sputtering Lantern, you can see a crude wooden table and two chairs in the middle of the hall. A pair of Bone Dice rests on the table and two Spears lie on the floor beside it. (If you want to keep any of these items, adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p>You are looking around the walls when you notice an archway directly opposite the main entrance, leading to a flight of stone steps. Quickly you cross to the archway and ascend the steps to a landing on the level above.</p>

<p>The screeching wall of noise ceases abruptly, and you open your eyes to see Xaol the Necromancer staring at you aghast. Frantically he snatches up a black iron staff that rests beside his throne of bones, and then he leaps from his seat with surprising agility. You reach for your Kai Weapon as he comes bounding towards you, his staff poised to thrust at your head. He lunges, not with a rod of iron but with a living serpent. The necromancer’s staff has transformed into a deadly, hissing black snake. Hastily you retreat as the serpent’s dripping fangs strike out for your throat.</p>

<p>Patiently you wait for the storm to abate. When finally the wind drops and the air sheds its dust, you are able to see the vast forest of Helkona stretching away to the northern horizon. It is a forbidding sight, a lifeless expanse of petrified trees that have been destroyed by poisons leeched from the blighted soil of the Darklands. You magnify your vision and you notice a crimson speck of light in the far distance. It emanates from the towers of Gazad Helkona, which you estimate to be no more than thirty miles away. The pinpoint glow of this blood-red light tells you that the fortress is occupied.</p>
<p>It is a dark and cloudy night, but you have little difficulty making your way down the trail to the bottom of the hilly ridge. Even in the dead of night the skies above this region are dully illuminated by the reflection of volcanic fires that rage amidst the surrounding mountains. When you look to the east you can see the lava streams of the Kagazitzaga Range; to the west, the fiery spouts of the Kokozritzaga. As you press on towards the petrified timberland of Helkona, you can feel the tremor of their constant eruptions vibrating beneath your feet.</p>

You beat him to the draw and lunge at his chest with your Kai Weapon, running him through. He sways on his feet, his knuckles white on his sword hilt; then his strength deserts him and he keels over backwards onto the hard stone floor. The wolfhound yelps and runs off, but the remaining bandit stands his ground.</p>

<p>The moment your feet touch down upon the flagstones, you hear a high-pitched squeak somewhere above your head. You glance up and a shadowy blur flashes before your eyes. Instinctively, you lash out with your fist and you feel your knuckles connect with something small and furry. Your punch rockets the object across the chamber and slams it against the far wall. There is a crack of breaking bones, and you see a furry, bat-like creature tumble limply to the floor.</p>
<p>Having successfully incapacitated both the Krorn and its vengeful pet, you make a swift search of the watchtower chamber and discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron Key</li>
<li>Sword</li>
<li>Halberd (Spear)</li>
<li>Enough food for 1 Meal</li>
<li>2 Gold Crowns</li>

<p>Having completed your search, you leave the chamber by an iron door and lock it behind you. A flight of spiral steps leads down to the ground level where you discover a second door. This one is also unlocked. Carefully you pull it open a few inches and peer through the gap.</p>

<p>You use your Magnakai Curing skills in an urgent attempt to restore Lone Wolf to consciousness. You unbutton the front of his battle-tunic and place your hands on his chest; then you transfer the warmth of your healing powers directly into his body (this use of your Magnakai Discipline costs you 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point). After a few minutes you feel his heartbeat growing stronger, yet before you can complete the healing procedure, you hear the daunting sound of steel-shod boots echoing up the shaft from below. You risk a glance over the parapet of the stairs and you see a dozen armoured Drakkarim emerging from the tunnel at the base of the shaft. As they come running up the steps, you see that most are armed with loaded crossbows.</p>
<p>Reluctantly you are forced to abandon your attempt to revive Lone Wolf. You heave him across your shoulder and take to the stairs once more, climbing as fast as your aching legs will carry you both towards the observatory roof, 60 feet above.</p>

<p>Your bold gamble pays off, for you are able to scurry through the breached wall as your cloak and Backpack ignite. You come to the end of the fissure and quickly you drop to the dusty ground, rolling over several times in order to smother the flames that threaten to engulf you. You suffer no injuries, but when you examine your Backpack you soon discover that two items are fire-damaged beyond repair. (Erase the first and last items that you have recorded on your <a href="#action">list of Backpack Items</a>.)</p>
<p>You are elated that you have traversed the breach in the perimeter wall, but when the dust clears for a few moments, your heart sinks like a stone. Another wall looms before you. This second barrier has only recently been constructed to shield the stronghold’s inner buildings from the fiery heat of the fissure. Its rough-hewn blocks offer many handholds to assist a climb, but the scorched stone and mortar are very dry and they crumble under the slightest pressure. Your first attempt to scale the wall comes to an abrupt end when a toehold collapses and you are sent tumbling backwards to the ground: lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point.</p>

<p>You watch with grim glee as the heavy statue falls end-over-end towards the ascending Drakkarim warriors. The assault trooper drops his sword and throws up his hands as the great bronze effigy slams into him with a sickening crunch. Groaning in agony, his skull and ribs crushed by the impact, he somersaults backwards and tumbles down the stairs, felling his comrades like skittles as he careers through their ranks. The few who are not bowled over by their leader, or the crushing statue of Chlanzor, immediately open fire at you with their crossbows and force you to seek cover behind the parapet. As you crouch beside Lone Wolf, a sudden shriek echoes across the observatory platform. Then an icy chill courses through your veins when you turn and look over your shoulder.</p>

<p>When the dial clicks into position,<sup><a href="#sect105-1-foot" name="sect105-1">10</a></sup> the heavy wooden doors swing open and a gust of putrid air makes you swallow hard before you take your first cautious step into the hall beyond. You cast a suspicious eye around this circular chamber for it is illuminated by tall candles that radiate a cold, cyanic light. The floor is strewn with bones and human cadavers in varying states of decomposition, and the walls are hung with great silken tapestries depicting horrific scenes that glorify the power of death and decay.</p>
<p>As your eagle eyes penetrate the gloom, your pulse races when they fall upon Lone Wolf. He sits cross-legged within a sphere of translucent grey light that hovers three feet above the floor. His divine blade, Sommerswerd, is cradled in his lap, and his head hangs limply against his chest. At first you believe he is unconscious; then your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen detects that he is engaged in a desperate mental battle against a host of invisible enemies who are seeking to enslave his soul.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration VIII]</div>
<p>The shadowy prison-sphere that entraps Lone Wolf hovers before a vile throne constructed entirely of human skulls and bones. Seated here is a thin man attired in black robes edged with gold and scarlet braid. His pale skin and feverish dark eyes are touched by the bluish glow of the surrounding candles, accentuating his sinister mien. With an extended right hand he grasps the surface of a large crystal sphere that is fixed to a pedestal beside his throne. This crystal is hollow, but its core is filled with swirling black vapours that radiate a deathly chill. The robed man stares fixedly at the sphere and appears to be mesmerized by it. You magnify your vision, and when you focus your gaze upon the sphere, suddenly you fathom the secret of the terrible power contained within.</p>

<p>You make your way to a ring of boulders near the exit from the gully where patiently you wait for the storm to abate. When finally the wind drops and the air sheds its dust, you are able to see the vast forest of Helkona stretching away to the northern horizon. It is a forbidding sight, a lifeless expanse of petrified trees that have been destroyed by poisons leeched from the blighted soil of the Darklands. You climb atop a boulder, and when you magnify your vision, you are able to make out a crimson speck of light in the far distance. It emanates from the towers of Gazad Helkona, which you estimate to be no more than thirty miles away. This pinpoint glow of blood-red light tells you that the fortress is occupied.</p>
<p>It is dark and cloudy, yet even in the dead of night the skies above this region are dully illuminated by the reflection of volcanic fires that rage amidst the surrounding mountains. When you glance to the east you can see the lava streams of the Kagazitzaga Range; to the west, you see the fiery spouts of the Kokozritzaga. As you approach the twisted tree-line of Helkona, you can feel the constant tremor of their eruptions vibrating beneath your feet.</p>

<p>Lone Wolf bids you follow as he steps through a shattered pane of the dome and climbs out onto the platform that encircles the observatory tower. The wild, sulphurous winds rip at your cloak and tunic, forcing you to crouch down and grasp the iron platform with both hands for fear of being blown over the edge. Yet these powerful winds do not seem to affect your leader. He stands erect and immobile, as if cast in solid stone. With an unblinking gaze he stares fixedly towards the southern horizon, his eagle eyes searching out Banedon’s skycraft.</p>
<p>Little more than twenty minutes have elapsed when Lone Wolf turns and looks down at your crouching form. <i>Banedon approaches,</i> he says, his silent words forming in your mind. You magnify your vision and scan the southern vista, but you are unable to discern a skyship among the roiling black clouds. Then you spot a sliver of light in the stormy sky, and your spirits rise. The <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> is fast approaching.</p>
<p>Guided by the pulsating glow of the observatory’s crimson beacon, and Lone Wolf’s telepathic messages, Banedon is able to bring the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> to within 50 feet of the dome. But the fierce winds prevent him from making a landing, and so he has his crew lower the boarding cage. The moment it sets down upon the platform, you follow Lone Wolf inside and slam shut the gate. There is a jolt as the hawser tenses, and then you feel the cage swaying the moment it is hoisted off the platform. Despite the violent swaying of the cage, you feel elated when you look through the bars of the cage door and see the shattered dome of the observatory receding beneath you. Then the exhilaration of your escape from Gazad Helkona is shattered when you hear a hideous shriek rise above the roar of the wind.</p>

<p>As you trudge along the rutted trail, you become aware that the night sky is beginning to brighten. Somewhere high above the perpetual blanket of cloud that engulfs this hateful territory, day is breaking. At length, the trail arrives at a junction where another broad track joins it from the west. There are no signposts to mark the way, but your Kai sense of direction steers you towards the east where a long slope ascends to a treeless ridge. When you come to the crest of this ridge and look beyond, you catch your first glimpse of the imposing walls of Gazad Helkona.</p>
<p>The broad-based fortress squats in a basin of rock at the centre of the petrified forest. Its coal-black walls are cracked and crumbling like some fossilized relic that is riddled with decay. Within its curtain wall, with its decrepit watchtowers and great iron gate, there are scores of minarets and needle-spires that seem to scratch malevolently at the passing clouds. You magnify your vision and you see that the emblem of Darklord Chlanzor is still emblazoned upon the rust-red surface of the fortress gate. It resembles a great black spider perched upon the surface of a blazing sun. Chlanzor may no longer be the commander of this stronghold, but the legacy of his rule remains.</p>
<p>You observe the fortress for several minutes and take in every detail of its foul design. The great gate is secure and well guarded, but you note two places where you may be able to effect an entry without being seen. The first is a breach to the west of the gate, where the wall has been undermined by a fissure of lava. The second is a great mound of rubble to the east of the gate, the remains of the upper storeys of a collapsed watchtower.

<p>You leave your shelter and make a careful descent to the end of the gully where the bodies are half-buried in the dust. The first one that you come to is the carcass of a mountain goat, the object that the flying creatures were fighting over. You suspect that this luckless animal was taken from the foothills of the Ogshezar Mountains, near the Skarorian city of Cragmantle, for this hardy breed of ruminants are common there. When you leave the carcass and approach the crushed remains of the second body, your stomach churns when you recognize its scaly, bat-winged form. It is a Kraan, a vile breed that was spawned and used by the Darklords to provide flying mounts for their Giak and Drakkarim armies. Darklord Zagarna mustered many thousands of these beasts when he invaded Sommerlund, and it was their assault by air which resulted in the destruction of the Kai Monastery. Some of the Kraan survived the fall of Helgedad and the demise of their Darklord masters, and you think it likely that this one has come from Gazad Helkona and was out scouting for food.

You must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (you cannot use Grand Huntmastery in this instance, for there are no flora or fauna that you can forage for in the petrified forest of Helkona).</p>
<p>Feeling revived after your brief rest, you decide to leave the basin and climb the tallest of the nearby trees in the hope that you can pinpoint your present location. Your effort is rewarded when you see the uppermost towers of Gazad Helkona rising above the tree-line less than fifteen miles to the northeast. With luck you should reach the fortress within four hours.</p>
<p>It is only an hour later when you happen upon a broad track through the forest. Its loose surface is rutted with wagon tracks, and when you look more closely, you discover evidence of traffic having passed this way recently in both directions.

<p>As the last of the trio falls victim to your deadly blows, you step away from his crumpled body and sheathe your bloodied weapon. Your senses detect that there are no other bandits lurking in this chamber, and when you scour its walls and furnishings, you realize that it is a mess hall used by Xaol’s bandit mercenaries and guards. Stale fragments of food litter the tables, and the acrid smell of wine and torch oil hangs heavily in the clammy air.</p>
<p>There is a trapdoor located near the tunnel exit from this hall, and on closer examination you discover that it covers a chute. Judging from the foul stench arising from this opening, you determine that the chute must descend to a cesspool located somewhere deep below the fortress blockhouse.

Fortunately, they are poorly aimed and none of them find their mark. Lone Wolf weaves a pattern with his hands and three of the Kraan come to an abrupt halt, as if the stormy air has suddenly turned to glass and imprisoned them. Meanwhile, you focus your attention upon a Kraan that is swooping down from the clouds above on a collision course with the cage. Its rider is carrying a smoking black orb fixed to a long length of chain. Impact looks imminent until, at the very last moment, the Drakkar tugs on the reins and the Kraan veers away.

<p>You scan the streets of this grim city-fortress and note that there are no individual dwellings here. The buildings of Gazad Helkona are grouped into four vast hexagonal blockhouse complexes, each topped by a cluster of minarets and spires.

A broad ramp leads to its portcullised gate which is guarded by a troop of fifty armoured sentries.

<p>Your killing blow brings Xaol staggering to his knees, gasping hoarsely. He drops his serpent staff and the instant it leaves his grasp, it shrivels up into a tight ball that hisses, smokes, and bubbles. Xaol falls to one side, his gaunt shaven head striking the bone-littered floor with a dull thud. Through blood-flecked lips he utters a curse, vowing one day to return from beyond the grave to wreak bloody vengeance upon you and the Kai. Then his dark eyes flicker and glaze over, and his thin frame convulses for a moment and falls still.</p>
<p>You leap over the withered remains of the necromancer and his cursed staff, and rush towards Lone Wolf. Slowly your master raises his tousled head and fixes you with his steely blue eyes. You sense that he has been greatly weakened by his ordeal. He has suffered much since his abduction, yet he has found the strength within himself to resist his cruel tormentors. Inspired by his resolute courage, you ask how you can free him from the prison-sphere. Lone Wolf mouths a reply, but you cannot hear him. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Divination you try to detect telepathic communication, but you sense that it is futile. No mind speech can penetrate the milky grey walls of Lone Wolf’s hovering prison. Then your leader glowers at the crystal sphere that is fixed atop a pedestal beside the throne of bones, and instantly you fathom his meaning. Slowly you mouth the words: ‘Must I destroy the sphere?’ Lone Wolf nods approvingly. Fired up by his directive, you raise your Kai Weapon and approach the crystal sphere. But before you come to within striking distance, a powerful gust of freezing air hits you in the chest and sends you reeling backwards to the floor.</p>

Motes of rust-coloured dust cling to every surface and the scorching air reeks of molten metal and sulphur.</p>
<p>An unbroken line of fiery bronze statues encircle the gallery, depicting former loyal servants of Darklord Chlanzor. You are casting your eye along their line when suddenly you see two of Xaol’s henchmen. They emerge from a passageway located next to a spiral staircase on the far side of the gallery. Quickly you take cover behind the nearest statue and watch as those two men, accompanied by a wolfhound, come walking around the gallery towards your hiding place.</p>

Valiantly you struggle to resist, but you are fearful that you no longer possess the strength needed to counter this powerful foe. An evil laugh echoes in your mind as slowly the wispy mass of black vapour spirals down towards your face. Desperately you lash out at your mocking adversary, but you lose your balance and collapse to your knees. With a prayer to Ishir on your lips, you watch with growing horror as a glowing spike of radiant energy appears at the core of Zorkaan’s form.

<p>You pass through the archway and climb the stairs to a landing where a long, tubular tunnel leads to an adjacent blockhouse complex. Twice in the tunnel you are forced to use your Magnakai Invisibility skills in order to avoid a confrontation with Drakkarim and Hammerland bandits. When finally you emerge from the tunnel, you find yourself in a torchlit chamber that is lined with bookshelves. Most of the tomes are badly burnt or have crumbled with age and neglect, but there is one on a high shelf that is still intact. Curiosity prompts you to retrieve and open this book, and inside you discover a phial of blue liquid wedged in a hollow gouged from the vellum pages. You withdraw the phial and hold it up to the torchlight, and immediately your Magnakai Curing skills inform you that this is Finglas—a rare and powerful healing potion. If you wish to keep this Potion of Finglas, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item. When swallowed, it will restore 7 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

It claws at its rival’s neck, forcing the creature to drop the object which plummets to the ground and splashes into the dust at the exit from the gully.

<p>Your Arrow whistles through the air to strike the Urgaroh squarely between the eyes, and the force of the impact sends the creature somersaulting backwards to land in an untidy heap. You shoulder your Bow and unsheathe your Kai Weapon, and then you hurry across the platform towards the Urgaroh with the intention of dealing it a killing blow. The creature is howling in agony and writhing on the floor as it struggles to wrench the Arrow from its skull. As the shaft comes free, the Urgaroh emits a last, terrible shriek. Then spontaneously its body ignites and burns fiercely, giving off a choking black smoke.</p>
<p>Above the noise of the wind that rushes through the shattered glass dome, you suddenly hear angry cries and the stomp of booted feet. The Drakkarim have regrouped and are storming the stairs once more, their numbers swelled by a score of Giaks and Hammerland bandits. Driven by instinct, you sheathe your Kai Weapon and pick up the Urgaroh’s crystal rod which lies near your feet; then you turn and rush to the head of the stairs.

Cringingly they apologize for their hound’s behaviour and promptly they drag him away. ‘Bah! Stupid fools!’ you growl, as you watch them enter the tunnel that leads to the exterior platform. Then as soon as they disappear from view, you turn and hurry around the gallery to the staircase opposite.</p>
<p>A short flight of iron steps ascends to a long, low-ceilinged hall.

<p>Lord Rimoah wishes you good luck as you step into the boarding cage in readiness to be winched up to the flying ship. Banedon is waiting on the stern deck to meet you and together you wave farewell to Rimoah as <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> gets underway. Rapidly the monastery recedes from view as the ship ascends into the clouds and forges a course across the grey Durncrag Mountains. You retire with Banedon to his quarters where together you study his navigational charts. The Shezar Hills lie a thousand miles away on a southwesterly bearing, and Banedon anticipates your arrival there within twelve hours. During the voyage, Banedon recalls the year MS 5075 when he was abducted by Nadziranim sorcerers and imprisoned in the Darklord fortress of Kaag. Had it not been for Lone Wolf’s brave and determined effort to save him, he would have surely perished there. Although anxious about Lone Wolf’s abduction, Banedon is also grateful to have been given this chance to help you save his friend from a similar predicament. ‘The task you’ve undertaken will be difficult and dangerous,’ he says, ‘but I beseech you, Grand Master, not to forswear your vow to save your master.’ Readily you reassure Banedon of your iron resolve to rescue Lone Wolf, no matter what difficulties lie ahead.</p>
<p>It is shortly before dusk when <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> approaches its destination. This is a shallow valley at the northwestern edge of the Shezar Hills, close to its border with the petrified forest of Helkona. You heed the lookout’s cry and go up on deck to observe the sullen landscape from the port rail. Meanwhile, Banedon takes command of the ship’s helm in readiness for a landing. As the craft descends, you survey the surrounding deadlands with trepidation. To the west, beyond the barren hilltops, a dull orangey light glows amidst the dust-choked clouds, proclaiming the hour of sunset. There is a strong sulphurous smell, and the distant hiss and rumble of active volcanoes lend further menace to this bleak, inhospitable landscape.</p>
<p>Banedon brings <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> gently to earth where it settles into the smooth, dusty soil. As his crewmen busy themselves securing its anchorage, he helps you to disembark.</p>
<p>‘Godspeed and good fortune, Grand Master,’ he says, as you get ready to descend to the ground by ladder. ‘I shall await Lone Wolf’s signal with optimism. Remember, when you have freed your master, he must speak to me telepathically. Only when I have received his mental command shall I approach Gazad Helkona. I will bring <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> into the centre of the city-fortress and look for your signal. May Ishir protect you both.’</p>
<p>You heed Banedon’s words and bid him farewell before descending to the ground. Then, with a final wave, you turn and trek north across the barren valley floor. In the distance there is an undulating ridge of hills which lie between you and the petrified forest of Helkona. In order to reach your final destination, the fortress at the heart of this dead timberland, you must first traverse this range of hills. You stop for a few moments to observe the hills in the failing light and determine two places where you may be able to cross them. The first is a narrow gully that bisects the range, and the second is a winding, windswept trail that ascends to the peak.</p>

<p>This second barrier has only recently been constructed to shield the stronghold’s inner buildings from the fiery heat of the fissure. Its rough-hewn blocks offer many handholds to assist a climb, but the dry stone and mortar crumble under the slightest pressure.

Its vast bulk is squeezed by the sides of the opening as it hoists itself out and perches on the lip of the aperture.

The perimeter around the base of Gazad Helkona has been cleared and levelled to provide an unobstructed field of fire for its defenders. To enter this area would have once brought a swift and certain death, but now the fortress garrison numbers but a fraction of the troops that used to patrol the battlements during the time of Darklord Chlanzor’s rule, and you are quietly confident that you can cross this killing zone and reach the fallen tower without being seen.</p>
<p>Aided by your Kai camouflage skills, you zigzag across the killing zone and take cover among the shattered blocks of stone lying strewn around the base of the damaged tower. When you are sure that your approach has gone unnoticed, you clamber up the mound of rubble towards an arrow slit 20 feet above. Here you crouch on a narrow ledge and peer into the dingy chamber that lies beyond the opening.</p>
<p>Seated on a block of wood to the left of the aperture is an ape-faced creature with leathery, gnarled skin. It is scooping a grey, paste-like gruel from out of a stone bowl which it swallows after having sucked it noisily through its jagged fangs.

On the far side of the hall is a wide flight of iron steps that ascend to a dark portal. Standing on either side of this shadowy exit are columns of red-veined obsidian, engraved with glowing silver runes.</p>

<p>The observatory platform is littered with chunks of rock and shattered glass. You peer over the parapet and, through the plume of grey smoke that is coiling up the shaft, you see that the lower landing no longer exists. Along with adjoining sections of the staircase, it has been transformed into a vast mound of rubble that lies heaped at the bottom of the shaft. The few enemy troops who have survived the explosion can no longer reach the observatory, but as you watch them attempting to recover the bodies of their fallen comrades, it crosses your mind that the explosion has also destroyed your only known exit from the roof.</p>
<p>You retreat from the parapet and resume your attempt to revive Lone Wolf. At first the signs are not good; his breathing is shallow and his skin has a sickly pallor. But then you notice that his eyes are moving beneath their closed lids and you sense that he is emerging from coma.</p>

<p>He raises his arm and you take hold of it and help him rise unsteadily to his feet. He surveys the devastated observatory and you sense that his agile mind is scrutinizing every detail. He reaches for his scabbard and breathes a heavy sigh of relief when his hand closes around the hilt of the Sommerswerd.</p>
<p>‘I trust my blade found its mark?’ he asks.</p>
<p>‘Aye, my lord,’ you reply. ‘Your timely action consigned Zorkaan to oblivion, and saved my life. For that I will be forever in your debt.’</p>

<p>Beyond the door you can see the flagstoned approaches that lie within the main gate. Hammerland bandits draw pails of dirty grey water from a well by the south wall, and a patrol of sour-faced Drakkarim marches past them with their spears couched untidily on their shoulders.</p>
<p>You scan the streets of this city-fortress and note that there are no individual dwellings here. The buildings of Gazad Helkona are grouped into four vast hexagonal blockhouse complexes, each topped by a cluster of minarets and spires. They are connected to one another by bridges that span the wide avenues between. At the centre of the stronghold is a massive octagonal citadel. A broad ramp leads to its portcullised gate which is guarded by fifty armoured sentries. As you observe the citadel, you sense a powerful concentration of evil lurking somewhere within its jet-black walls. Its highest level is dominated by a domed observatory which emits a pulsating crimson light. Your Sixth Sense tells you that Lone Wolf is being held captive somewhere within this edifice, and it hardens your resolve to rescue him.</p>
<p>You quickly determine that the citadel gate is too heavily defended for you to dare risk entering by such a direct route. Instead, you resolve to get into this stronghold by one of the bridges that connect it to the surrounding blockhouse complexes. The nearest blockhouse is 100 yards from the doorway, and you can see two possible ways to enter. There are a pair of iron doors at ground level, and a staircase which leads up to a balconied landing.</p>

<p>The Drakkar’s reactions are handicapped by his heavy armour, and he is beaten by the speed and accuracy of your shot. Your Arrow strikes him in the throat before he can raise his shield, and it brings him crashing to his knees. Groaning in agony, his gauntleted fingers scrabbling uselessly at your feathered shaft, he topples backwards and tumbles down the stairs, felling his comrades like skittles as he careers through their ranks. The few who are not bowled over by their leader immediately open fire at you with their crossbows, forcing you to dive for cover behind the parapet.

<p>Gasping for breath, you reach the top of the stairs and stagger onto a circular steel platform. Through the giant windows that encircle this observatory landing, you look out across the grim grey vista of Gazad Helkona and marvel at its terrible splendour. The surrounding acres of iron and stone are bathed by glowing waves of crimson light. These pulses emanate from a huge crystal set atop the observatory dome. It is a sorcerous gem and it was placed here by Darklord Chlanzor’s Nadziranim, his dark wizards, as a beacon to guide home his fearsome squadrons of Kraan. As you stare up at this evil stone, you draw some comfort from the thought that soon its radiant light may help guide Guildmaster Banedon’s flying ship to your rescue.</p>
<p>You place Lone Wolf behind the parapet near the top of the stairs; then you risk another look down into the shaft. You see that the Drakkarim have taken up a position on the landing below where they are waiting for you to present yourself as a target.

You suspect that they must be attracted by the bitter stench of the Skryza’s blood, but it is also the opportunity for vengeance that is drawing them here. For years the Skryza has trapped and consumed thousands of their kind, but now the time has come for them to wreak their revenge.</p>
<p>Before the direflies appear, you escape into the trees. The webs prevent you from heading directly north, towards Gazad Helkona, and so you are forced instead to go east and detour around them.

Then you retrieve the Sommerswerd from the ground, and for a few moments you marvel at its craftsmanship and fine balance. With this divine blade grasped firmly in your hand, you hurry to the prison-sphere and thrust its tip into a ragged tear that was made when Lone Wolf hurled the Sommerswerd at Zorkaan. Crimson sparks erupt from the rent in the sphere as determinedly you work the sword with a sawing motion. The split lengthens until you are able to reach in and grab hold of Lone Wolf’s tunic. Carefully you pull your unconscious leader out of his sorcerous cell; then you sheathe the Sommerswerd in his scabbard before you heave his limp body over your shoulder.

<p>You examine the door’s copper lockplate and determine that this mortise could be easier to pick than the one that secures the centre door. Purposefully you set about the task, and after a few minutes the lock opens with a loud <i>click</i>.</p>
<p>Cautiously you push open the door and enter a broad hall constructed entirely from black marble slabs. A strange amber light illuminates the upper walls and domed ceiling, cast by a dozen gold cressets fixed into the walls. Two large pedestals stand near the centre of the hall, each one topped by a horned skull. As you approach these pedestals, you hear the door slam shut behind you. Instinctively you spin around and you see that there is no lockplate on the inside of the door. Its black surface is entirely smooth, blending seamlessly with the sombre marble walls.</p>

<p>The Drakkarim hack at you with their deadly blades, but skilfully you turn them aside. The clangour of striking steel echoes noisily around the chamber as you parry and block their wild blows. The older and more aggressive of the two warriors recognizes that you are a formidable enemy and he pulls away abruptly, as if he is retreating from the fight. But then he signals to his comrade with a nod of his head and together they rush you, their swords held high in readiness to strike at your head.</p>

<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense warns you of the energy bolt that is streaking towards your back, and you dive to one side to avoid being hit. It whooshes over your shoulder and explodes against the parapet at the top of the stairs, peppering you with sharp fragments of stone (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>Fearful that the creature is about to launch another bolt, you scramble to your feet and defiantly you turn to face this merciless foe.</p>

<p>Your Kai Mastery alerts you to something lurking in the rafters of this hall. Using your infravision, you scour the high ceiling and see the unmistakable heat-picture of a Kraan perched on an iron beam. Hungrily it stares down at you with dark, malevolent eyes. You stare back defiantly, until you see it flex its talons and unfurl its bat-like wings; then a cold tingle runs down your spine. Your Sixth Sense is warning you that this ravenous predator is getting ready to attack.</p>

<p>You summon the mental shapes of the Old Kingdom Spell <i>Power Word</i> and project this magical word at the crystal sphere: <i>Gloar!</i></p>
<p>A ball of concussive force hurtles across the hall, but before it strikes its mark, it is deflected away by a sudden gust of icy-cold wind. The diverted word collides with the throne and shatters the back of the seat in an explosion of dust and bone fragments.</p>
<p>Undaunted by this reversal, you rush towards the sphere with the intention of kicking it from its pedestal, but as you bring back your leg in readiness to strike, the dark shadow of Zorkaan falls upon you and launches a massive psychic attack from close range.</p>

<p>You call upon your advanced Kai skill to order the malevolent dog to go away. Its growling quickly transforms into a pathetic whimper, and then its nerve breaks and it takes off along the street at a run.</p>
<p>As it disappears from view, you climb the stairs to the first floor where you discover a wooden door banded with criss-crossing strips of enamelled iron. At its centre there is a polished black handle and a dial which is ringed with numbers. You examine the dial closely and determine that it controls a combination lock. By turning the dial to its correct numerical setting, you will cause the lock to disengage and the door will open.</p>
<p>Using your Kai Sixth Sense, you discover that the correct setting is the same as the distance in miles that you travelled aboard the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>, from the Kai Monastery to the Shezar Hills, divided by the 50 miles that you travelled on foot from the Shezar Hills to Gazad Helkona.</p>

<p>You recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Counterspell</i> and direct its power at the invisible force field. Unfortunately your spell backfires, for it creates a psychic channel between your mind and the evil magic that is contained within the silver runes.</p>
<p>Suddenly a burning sensation fills your head. You are forced to swiftly cancel the spell to put an end to the pain that is washing through your mind: lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>As soon as his ship is a safe distance beyond the walls of Gazad Helkona, Guildmaster Banedon hands control of the helm to his bo’sun and then hurries down to the main deck to greet you and Lone Wolf. He praises you heartily for the success of the rescue, and Lone Wolf in turn thanks you sincerely for saving him from the clutches of Naar’s fell disciples.</p>
<p>A swift course is set for the Kai Monastery and the voyage is completed within ten hours. You spend most of the journey home sleeping off the fatigue of your ordeal, but you awake in time to join Lone Wolf at the prow as <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> approaches the monastery shortly after dawn.</p>
<p>Your arrival is greeted by a chorus of thunderous cheers from your fellow kinsmen. Every Kai who is present at the monastery rushes to the training park to celebrate the return of your leader. Banedon positions his craft above the park, and hawsers are dropped from stern and prow to anchor it in position. Then you join Lone Wolf in the boarding cage which is swiftly lowered to the ground.</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah appears among the excited throng of young Kai Lords who are gathered around the cage. With tears of joy welling in his eyes, he embraces you both and then offers up a prayer of thanksgiving to the Goddess Ishir for your safe return. He voices his hope that Lone Wolf’s abduction will serve as a poignant reminder to the Kai that they should be on their guard at all times, for Naar and his agents will always exploit an opportunity to damage or destroy your noble order.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XX]</div>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. You have met this difficult challenge and you have triumphed. Your brave and daring rescue of Lone Wolf will long be remembered in the legends of the New Order Kai. Yet the fight against evil goes ever on. Soon your courage and Kai skills will be put to the test again in a distant realm of Magnamund. The nature of the quest and the dangers that await you will be revealed in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure entitled:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to any bonus points given to you by your Kai Weapon, Special Items, or Grand Master Disciplines.</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. This number = Combat Ratio.</li>
<li>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio along the top of the chart and cross-reference to the random number you have picked. (E indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Enemy. GM indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to yourself.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from Stage 3 until one character is dead. This is when the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either character falls to 0 or below.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="smevazn">To Evade Combat</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>You may only do this when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>You undertake one round of combat in the usual way. All points lost by the enemy are ignored; only you lose the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>If the book offers the chance of taking evasive action in place of combat, it can be taken in the first or any subsequent round (unless specifically stated otherwise).</li>

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
