 <div class="frontmatter">

   <p>For centuries the Shom’zaa has lain incarcerated and forgotten in a granite prison located deep below the mountains of Bor. Now this terrifying beast has accidentally been set free, and its hunger for vengeance knows no bounds. With a horde of vile minions at its command, swiftly the Shom’zaa enacts its sinister plan to destroy King Ryvin and the wondrous realm of the Drodarin dwarves.</p>

   <p>In <strong><cite>The Fall of Blood Mountain</cite></strong>, you must journey to the fabulous subterranean kingdom of the dwarves and attempt to save your ancient allies from the wrath of the Shom’zaa. Will you succeed in your mission or will you succumb to the terrible powers of this ancient champion of Evil?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai—the warrior élite of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>It is early winter in the year MS 5084, thirty-four years since the First Order of the Kai was massacred by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. Lone Wolf, the supreme leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of the Darklord attack upon the Kai. As a young initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. Twenty years later he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>
<p>With the destruction of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>
<p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace has reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and a New Order has been firmly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS 5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. Over the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents have helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you have risen swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement that has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>
<p>In the year MS 5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf’s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King’s Army of Sommerlund.<sup><a href="#tssf-1-foot" name="tssf-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>During the seven years that have elapsed since the defeat of his minions, Naar has sought vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and quietly they wait in the shadows for the day when they may serve their fell master. One such agent was Lord Vandyan of Eldenora. Guided by Naar, Vandyan sought and found three ancient runes of evil. Empowered by his discoveries, Vandyan summoned a vast army of reptilian warriors—the Vorka—which he used to conquer and occupy the lands of his peaceful neighbours. Emboldened by his martial successes, Vandyan overran much of central Magnamund, including the realm of Lyris—one of Sommerlund’s oldest allies. In response to a plea for help from Lyris, Lone Wolf mounted a Kai crusade to raise the Vorka siege of Varetta, its capital city.</p>
<p>During this crusade, you undertook a vital mission behind enemy lines that turned the tide of the whole campaign. Alone, you infiltrated Vandyan’s daunting fortress of Skull-Tor and destroyed the three runes, thereby extinguishing the source of the power by which the Vorka horde were permitted to exist. Vandyan’s army dissolved on the battlefield and the Kai were able to raise the siege of Varetta.<sup><a href="#tssf-2-foot" name="tssf-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>During your mission in Skull-Tor, you discovered that the Vorka were not the only creatures that Vandyan had summoned by the power of the runes. A demonic entity called Zorkaan the Soultaker had also been brought to Magnamund from its lair upon the Plane of Darkness—the ethereal domain of Naar. Having fought and defeated this creature, you believed that it had perished forever when subsequently you smashed the runes. Sadly, this was not so. After celebrating the battlefield victory at Varetta, Lone Wolf ordered you to return in triumph to the Kai Monastery aboard the flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. He chose to ride with his New Order crusaders and they were expected to arrive home a week later.</p>
<p>After five days, a Kai scout arrived unexpectedly at the monastery with shocking news to impart. Lone Wolf had disappeared. Those who witnessed the abduction said that he was engulfed by a whirling black shadow that fell upon him from out of a stormy sky. So swift was the attack that your fellow Grand Masters were unable to prevent him from being carried away. The scout’s description of the whirling black shadow was identical to the form adopted by Zorkaan the Soultaker. The destruction of the rune used by Vandyan to summon Zorkaan had not brought about the creature’s demise after all: it had trapped the creature upon Magnamund.</p>
<p>You had achieved a great victory at Skull-Tor, but the shocking news of Lone Wolf’s abduction cast a shadow over your triumph there. Hurriedly you summoned Guildmaster Banedon, the leader of Sommerlund’s Guild of Magicians, to an emergency council at the Kai Monastery. He responded swiftly to your summons and arrived within hours aboard his flying craft <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. He was accompanied by Lord Rimoah of Dessi, an Elder Magi magician who is also Lone Wolf’s oldest friend and advisor.</p>
<p>Rimoah informed you that Zorkaan’s arrival upon Magnamund had not gone unnoticed by the Elder Magi. From afar they had sensed the creature’s presence and, through the use of their Old Kingdom magic, Rimoah and his fellow elders had charted its movements. Rimoah told you of an evil sorcerer called Xaol who was in hiding in Gazad Helkona, a former Darklord city-fortress located in the desolate wastes of northern Skaror. This vile necromancer was a known agent of Naar. During the days before Lone Wolf’s abduction, Rimoah and the Elder Magi had detected streams of psychic communication coursing between Gazad Helkona and the Plane of Darkness.</p>
<p>‘Naar was transmitting to Xaol the secrets of a Ritual of Binding by which the freed spirit of Zorkaan could be enslaved,’ said Rimoah. ‘This ritual was enacted successfully in the stronghold of Gazad Helkona. Through Xaol, Naar has gained control over Zorkaan. He sent this creature to assassinate Lone Wolf, yet the attempt was unsuccessful. Zorkaan failed to kill Lone Wolf…but he was able to subdue and kidnap him.’</p>
<p>Rimoah informed you that your leader was being held prisoner in Gazad Helkona. By the use of his Supreme Master Disciplines and the power of the Sommerswerd, his magical blade, Lone Wolf had survived death at the hand of Naar’s foul creation. ‘Your leader is brave and resourceful,’ he said, ‘but I fear that Zorkaan’s frequent attacks will weaken and eventually destroy him unless he is rescued quickly.’</p>
<p>Selflessly you volunteered to attempt the rescue. Rimoah and Banedon, impressed by your courage and your confidence, readily agreed to help you achieve your difficult mission and together you formulated a plan of action. Banedon transported you aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> to a remote valley south of Gazad Helkona, from where you approached the fortress on foot. Despite great adversity you were able to gain entry to Xaol’s fortress and save your leader from the clutches of Naar’s agent.<sup><a href="#tssf-3-foot" name="tssf-3">3</a></sup> During your daring mission, you fought and defeated both Xaol and Zorkaan before Banedon arrived to snatch both you and Lone Wolf from the clutches of Xaol’s angry minions.</p>
<p>A year has elapsed since your triumph at Gazad Helkona. It has been a peaceful and rewarding time for you at the Kai Monastery, a period in which you have devoted yourself to the training of new recruits. Such has been the success of your tutelage that you have come to be greatly revered by your students and your peers. Yet, lately, you have felt a longing to venture abroad once more, to test your courage and your battle skills in the ineluctable war against Evil.</p>
<p>Early one morning, you glimpsed a golden eagle leave its nest in the frost-covered timberland that stretches beyond the window of your private chamber. As you watched this majestic creature soar above the tree-line, you were reminded of the daring aerial escape that you had made from Gazad Helkona aboard Banedon’s skycraft. Then you felt a tingle of premonition at the nape of your neck when you noticed a distant speck in the clear azure sky. This speck grew larger until you were able to discern the distinctive outline of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> approaching from the north. Hurriedly you left your chamber and went to the monastery training park where a small group of Kai Lords had gathered in expectation. As the sleek skyship was made to hover overhead, a boarding cage was lowered to the frost-hardened ground and out stepped an unexpected visitor—Lord Rimoah of Dessi. You exchanged greetings and he requested an immediate audience with Lone Wolf. From his sombre expression you could tell that he had grave and urgent news to impart.</p>
<p>You escorted Lord Rimoah personally to Lone Wolf’s chambers, located beneath the Tower of the Sun, the monastery’s commanding citadel. Before you could excuse yourself and leave the vault, Lone Wolf asked you to stay to listen to what the venerable magician had come to say. Lord Rimoah nodded his benign approval.</p>
<p>‘Dwarf King Ryvin of Bor is in desperate need of our aid, my lords,’ began Rimoah, earnestly. ‘An ancient horror has been awoken in the depths of his subterranean kingdom, and now it threatens to destroy his realm. The Drodarin race may be doomed unless we are able to overcome this creature…and swiftly.’</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah informed you that recent excavations in the lowest levels of the vast underground kingdom of Bor had disturbed the Shom’zaa. This powerful entity was entombed by the Elder Magi during their 1,000-year war against Agarash the Damned—Naar’s first champion of evil. Lone Wolf lowered his eyes and shook his head in disbelief upon hearing Rimoah’s words.</p>
<p>‘I understood that dwarf lore expressly forbade such deep mining, for fear that the Shom’zaa and its minions might be released. How could such a thing have been allowed to occur?’ he said.</p>
<p>‘Greed is to blame, my lord,’ replied Rimoah, sadly, ‘…the greed of King Ryvin’s elder son, the Crown Prince Leomin. He alone was responsible for the excavations that opened the way to this ancient horror.’</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah informed you that only five days have elapsed since the Shom’zaa was released, yet already the creature and its Agarashi minions have taken control of the lower levels of the kingdom. ‘Bitter fighting rages in the tunnels and chambers of Bor as King Ryvin’s army struggles to contain the Shom’zaa and its horde,’ he said. ‘They are being sorely pressed, for the enemy have captured their armouries and equipped themselves for the fight. Ryvin has lost control of the tunnels leading to his throne chamber, where Leomin and his younger brother, Prince Torfan, are now trapped and besieged, along with the remnants of their personal guard.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf was disturbed to hear that the Throne Chamber of Bor was under attack, for it houses the fabled Throne of Andarin. This grand seat contains a gem of power that was bestowed upon the Drodarin dwarves of Bor by the Goddess Ishir. Its divine radiance provides the dwarves with a unique energy that enables them to grow their crops deep underground, without the need for direct sunlight. If the Throne of Andarin is destroyed then the crops will surely fail and famine will beset Bor, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>‘Repeated attempts to break the siege of the throne chamber have failed, and the morale of Ryvin’s army is now dangerously low,’ said Rimoah. ‘I’ve heard tell that even the Dwarf Lords and the War-thanes, the élite of Ryvin’s army, hold that Prince Leomin’s greed has sealed their fate. If such talk is true, and the Shom’zaa conquers Bor, then our hopes for a lasting peace in Magnamund will be ruined. The fall of Bor will give Naar a base of power at the very heart of Magnamund. There he will be able to muster his agents, spawn his vile abominations, and attempt once more to conquer our world.’</p>
<p>‘But what can be done to save Bor before it is too late?’ asked Lone Wolf, anxiously.</p>
<p>‘King Ryvin lacks the means to destroy this enemy,’ replied Rimoah, gravely. ‘Nevertheless, the means exist. The Shom’zaa is especially vulnerable to magic of the Old Kingdom. It is the magic that we used to entrap and entomb the creature millennia ago.’</p>
<p>From a pocket of his flowing robes, Rimoah took out a spherical crystal and held it in the cupped palm of his hand. Its multi-faceted surface radiated beams of golden light which shimmered and sparkled with a supernatural brilliance.</p>
<p>‘A Sun-crystal,’ said Lone Wolf.</p>
<p>‘Yes, my lord,’ replied Rimoah, reverently. ‘By the skilful use of the power contained within this sphere it is possible that we may defeat the Shom’zaa and its minions, and thereby spare the kingdom of Bor from the tyrannical rule of Naar. We of the Elder Magi have crafted the means to defeat the Shom’zaa, but in all Magnamund only the Kai have the ability and courage that is needed to take this goodly weapon and use it to its full effect.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf approached Rimoah and took the Sun-crystal from his outstretched palm. Then he turned to face you.</p>
<p>‘We have been called upon to undertake a difficult and dangerous mission, Grand Master,’ he said. ‘You have proven your bravery and skill beyond all doubt, and truly you have earned the right to refuse this quest with honour. Yet I sense that you hunger for the heat of battle and the challenge of the quest, and so I offer this mission to you. Will you venture to Bor and confront the bane that now threatens to destroy our dwarven allies?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, my lord, I will,’ you replied, without a moment’s hesitation. ‘For the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Kai, I am proud to accept the quest.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>) and physical stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 32). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21–25), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to this adventure.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">4</a></sup> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>
<h3><a name="kainame">Your Kai Name</a></h3>

<p>It has long been the tradition of your élite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year’s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
<p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

<p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor—Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf—you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>
<p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which you begin the <cite>New Order</cite> series, means that you are skilled in the use of <em>one</em> of the weapons listed below.</p>
<p>For every adventure that you complete successfully in the <cite>New Order</cite> series while possessing the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery, you will gain proficiency with one additional weapon.</p>
<p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 points to any number you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.</p>
<h5><a name="anmlmstr">Animal Mastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.</p>
<h5><a name="deliver">Deliverance <em>(Advanced Curing)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, while in combat, their <small>ENDURANCE</small> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. This emergency ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
<h5><a name="assimila">Assimilance <em>(Advanced Invisibility)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of one to three days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques which make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.</p>
<h5><a name="hntmstry">Grand Huntmastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and they possess great natural speed and agility. They also have a superb sense of touch and taste. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p>
<h5><a name="pthmnshp">Grand Pathsmanship</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by hostile plants. Also they have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.</p>
<h5><a name="kaisurge">Kai-surge</a></h5>

<p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, New Order Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (Kai-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously). New Order Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>
<h5><a name="kaiscrn">Kai-screen</a></h5>

<p>During psychic combat, New Order Grand Masters are able to construct mind-fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="nexus">Grand Nexus</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to withstand contact with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="gnosis">Telegnosis <em>(Advanced Divination)</em></a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far fewer ill effects. Duration of the spirit-walk and the protection afforded to his inanimate body increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="magi">Magi-magic <em>(Old Kingdom Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of Old Kingdom battle-magic. These arcane skills include the use of basic Old Kingdom Spells, such as <i>Shield</i>, <i>Power Word</i>, and <i>Invisible Fist</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="alchemy">Kai-alchemy <em>(Brotherhood Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf and Guildmaster Banedon (the leader of Sommerlund’s Guild of Magicians), you have mastered the elementary spells of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells include <i>Lightning Hand</i>, <i>Levitation</i>, and <i>Mind Charm</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Brotherhood magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="astrolgy">Astrology</a></h5>

<p>The celestial bodies which occupy the skies above Magnamund have long been known to affect the lives of its inhabitants. Mastery of this Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to predict and shape the future by studying the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the myriad planets and stars. The number and accuracy of these predictions increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="herbmst">Herbmastery</a></h5>

<p>Mastery of this New Order Discipline enables a Grand Master to identify readily any substance derived from living or growing organic material. He is aware of any secret uses to which an organic material may be put, and he is skilled in effecting the release of a substance’s medicinal and/or magical properties.</p>
<h5><a name="element">Elementalism</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. By drawing upon individual elements that are available, or combinations thereof, he is able to detach, affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove, or accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, e.g. create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove air, intensify fire. The versatility of this Discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="bardsman">Bardsmanship</a></h5>

<p>Through mastery of this Discipline a Kai Grand Master of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of legend, mimic speech or dialect, and stimulate a wide range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect and power of his bardic abilities will steadily increase as he advances through the Grand Master ranks.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 26 of the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series, you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in Book 27. For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original five Disciplines you begin with, you may add 1 point to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> score and 2 points to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original five Grand Master Disciplines, your Kai Weapon,<sup><a href="#discplnz-1-foot" name="discplnz-1">5</a></sup> and any other Special Items and Backpack Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>New Order</cite> adventure, which is called: <a href="../lw/27v.htm#title"><cite>Vampirium</cite>.</a></p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before you leave the Kai Monastery and begin your journey to Bor, you equip yourself with a <a href="#map">map of Bor and its surrounding territories</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>New Order</cite> adventures (Books 21–25), you may add this sum to the number of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadsword (Weapons)<br /><br />

<h4><a name="kaiweapn">Kai Weapons</a></h4>

<p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the élite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>
<p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a href="#action">Special Items List</a>.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe ‘Alema’.</p>
<p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you were to use ‘Alema’ in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of +7 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> would remain at +5.</p>

<h4><a name="howuse">Equipment—How to use it</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct Weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this Weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful Weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is best to equip yourself also with a close combat Weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is 12.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai Weapon</dt>
<dd>Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal Weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This is in addition to the bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your five Disciplines, then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Bor is the Ain, though Gold Crowns are readily accepted. 1 Ain equals 1 Gold Crown. These coins are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
You, Grand Master (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. You also possess the Kai Weapon ‘Ulnarias’, so you add an additional 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This gives you a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 45.<br /><br />
You now subtract the Wild Dogs’ <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45−31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself—Grand Master.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>You (GM) lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
<li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only you may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of New Order Kai Grand Mastership</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road of Kai Grand Mastership.

<dd>Kai Grand Guardians with this skill enjoy increased mobility when travelling across all types of terrain, whether on foot or on horseback. This improved ability can be very useful when used to outdistance a pursuing enemy.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to attack up to three enemies in psychic combat simultaneously.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this Discipline are able to exercise a defensive psychic skill known as <i>Mindblend</i>. This cloaking ability enables a Kai Grand Guardian to protect their mind and also prevent it from being detected by a hostile psychic probe.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Splinter</i>—This causes breakable items such as bottles, jugs, mirrors, windows, etc., to shatter to pieces. The range of this spell increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Flameshaft</i>—This causes the tip of any Arrow, or Arrow-like missile, to burn fiercely with a magical flame which cannot readily be extinguished by normal means.</li>
</ul><br /><br />

<h4><a name="sunknight">Sun Knight</a></h4>

<p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Sun Knight, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights with this Discipline are able to wield two-handed weapons (i.e. Broadsword, Quarterstaff, and Spear) with full effect using only one hand.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Knights with this skill are able to repel at will all normal-sized insects within a radius of three yards. The range and number of insects so affected increase considerably as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Deliverance</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature’s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing process takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state, the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Astrology</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who have this Discipline are skilled in the art of chiromancy—the ability to tell fortunes from the skin creases and patterns found on the palms of hands.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
<dd>Sun Knights who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to use their musical skills to launch sonic attacks against any individual within audible range. The effect of a sonic attack is dependent upon the target creature’s sensitivity to sound (i.e. a deaf creature would be unaffected by such an attack).<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Halt Missile</i>—This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2–3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight time in which to move away from the missile’s line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Strength</i>—By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of additional improvements and how they affect your existing Grand Master Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Grand Master Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> books.</p>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>Lone Wolf places the Sun-crystal in the palm of your hand, and then he closes your fingers around is multi-faceted surface. At once you sense that the gentle warmth of this artefact belies a tremendous power that is locked within its core. (Record the Sun-crystal on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep in the pocket of your tunic. You must discard another item in its favour if you already possess the maximum number of Special Items permissible.)</p>
<p>‘The Sun-crystal will do you no harm, Grand Master. Only Shom’zaa need have fear of its power,’ says Lord Rimoah, reassuringly.</p>
<p>‘How is this so?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘The energy that permits the demon to exist in our world is drawn directly from the Plane of Darkness,’ explains Rimoah. ‘There is an open channel between the creature and Naar’s evil domain. It is a slender, ethereal link. This invisible conduit has kept the creature alive during its long entombment, yet soon it may prove to be its undoing, for it is this link to the Plane of Darkness that will trigger the Sun-crystal’s cleansing powers. The merest touch of the crystal upon Shom’zaa’s foul hide will be enough to consign it to oblivion.’</p>
<p>With your briefing now complete, Lone Wolf orders you to return to your chamber to make swift preparations for an immediate voyage to Bor. You collect your equipment and your Kai Weapon, say a hurried farewell to your fellow Grand Masters, and then race to the training park where Lord Rimoah is awaiting you in the boarding cage. Lone Wolf bids you good luck and godspeed as you step inside, and proudly you return his salute as the cage is winched up to the stern deck of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. Rimoah gives the crew the command to depart and, as the great craft gets underway, you stand at the aft rail and watch as the frosted walls and towers of the Kai Monastery swiftly recede into the distance.</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah invites you to accompany him to the captain’s quarters where, to your surprise, you discover the cabin is empty; Banedon is not aboard. ‘The Guildmaster is unable to travel with us,’ explains Rimoah, ‘but he has placed his skyship and crew entirely at our disposal. We owe him a debt of gratitude, for time is against us and there can be no swifter way for us to reach our destination.’</p>
<p>During the fourteen hours that it takes to travel by skycraft to Bor, Lord Rimoah tells you much about the kingdom of the dwarves, their long history, and their proud legends. You also learn that your destination is Boradon, the principal city of Bor, and you are intrigued to discover that in your native language this ancient Drodarin name has a somewhat evocative meaning: ‘the Mountain of Blood’.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>You sense that the magical warhammer possesses properties to rival those of your Kai Weapon. The possession of such a weapon would be a great asset in combat. However, the cracks and holes that scar the lid of the tomb bear testimony to the fact that many others before you have tried to take this weapon, and they have all failed.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue with your attempt to break open the lid of Andarin’s tomb, <a href="#sect27">turn to 27</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect3">3</a></h3>

<p>As you struggle to hold on to Prince Leomin, you are struck many times by chunks of rock and other loose debris: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Gradually the whirling vortex of the implosion grows smaller and smaller as its power collapses and fades. Then, with a loud <i>Crack!</i> it is gone completely. The gloom is lifted and a serene calmness envelops the chamber. You sense that Shom’zaa’s link to the Plane of Darkness has been severed, and all trace of the Evil that was imprisoned here for so long has now been swept away.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="#sect294">turn to 294</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>The moment you cease your sonic attack, the Brozal shudder as if they have suddenly awoken from some nightmarish dream. Their senses have been restored, and with them comes a blind fear of your deadly sonic skills. They turn and flee for their lives, crashing through the crops that line the southern perimeter of the clearing.</p>
<p>You run towards the east and re-enter the tall wheat. Then carefully you skirt around the area of blazing crops before continuing your trek northwards. Soon you come to a muddy ditch which marks the boundary between the wheat fields and its neighbouring crop of barley. The cereal plants here are shorter, and you are able to catch sight of the roof of a Drodarin farmhouse less than 50 yards ahead.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate this farmhouse, <a href="#sect73">turn to 73</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to avoid the farmhouse, <a href="#sect37">turn to 37</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>You draw upon your mastery of psychic defences to create a <i>Mindblend</i> to shield yourself from the creature’s probe. It fails to detect your living presence here and, with a petulant hiss, it signals to its minions to continue. When you can no longer hear the rasping sound of their clawed feet scraping the tunnel floor, you uncoil yourself and get to your feet.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the bodies that are lying in this tunnel, <a href="#sect144">turn to 144</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to explore the tunnel further, <a href="#sect160">turn to 160</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>You draw upon your elemental skills to create a shield of hot air between you and the icy blast. You glimpse the air shimmering in front of your face, and then the deadly blast cuts through it with spectacular effect.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If your current <small>ENDURANCE</small> score is higher than 20, add 2 to the number you have picked. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 1.</p>

<p class="choice">If it is 7 or higher, <a href="#sect75">turn to 75</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>You speak the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i> and level your right arm at the creature’s eyes. A bolt of blue-white flame leaps from your fingertips and arcs towards the beast, but as it nears its head, the creature slams its glowing fists together and catches it in mid-air. Instantly, your bolt explodes in a shower of sizzling sparks. The shock of this violent discharge stuns the creature and it recoils with a high-pitched shriek. But it quickly recovers, and then it comes lumbering towards you with both its fiery fists raised.</p>
<p>Fearful that your missile’s fate could be your own if you allow this creature to get too close, you retreat from the tomb and run across the chamber to the alcove. Quickly you pull the lever and a secret panel in the wall slides open to reveal a narrow passage beyond. Taking hold of the stonework that frames the panel, you pull yourself towards the narrow gap. You are only halfway through the opening when two orbs of living flame leap from the creature’s glowing fists and come arcing towards your spine.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 2 to the number you have picked. If you possess Assimilance, add 1.</p>

<h3><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>The parapet of the barricade explodes as the icy bolt of energy slams into it with devastating effect. A section of timber penetrates your side and you are knocked to the ground by the force of the impact: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>The War-thanes help you to get back on your feet, and defiantly you raise your Kai Weapon as the first wave of the Shom’zaa horde reaches the barricade. The War-thanes fight with ruthless efficiency, felling ten of the enemy for every Drodarin who falls. But the horde are gripped by a battle-frenzy that drives them like demons, and you are hard-pressed to keep them from breaking through the barricade.</p>
<p class="combat">Shom’zaa Horde (in battle-frenzy): <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 47   <small>ENDURANCE</small> 45</p>

<h3><a name="sect9">9</a></h3>

<p>You leap across the bodies of your slain foes and run along the line of ore wagons towards the tunnel exit. A battle is now raging in the smelting cavern as the freed dwarves take their revenge upon their alien captors. In the chaos of this combat, you reach the stone channel at the point where it crosses the wagon track, and you duck behind a supporting pillar to avoid colliding with a trio of minions that are racing to join the battle. The exit is just 20 yards ahead and it appears to be open and unguarded.</p>

<h3><a name="sect10">10</a></h3>

<p>You draw upon your Kai powers of Elementalism to cause a gust of air to blow away the priming powder from the cannon’s touch-hole. One of the enemy places a burning taper to the hole, confident that the Throne of Andarin is about to be obliterated, but the cannon fails to fire when the primer does not ignite.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect150">Turn to 150</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect11">11</a></h3>

<p>For more than a mile you ride the torrid waters of this underground river. Its swift current takes you through a series of low, dark caverns, and steeply-sloping chutes, until you reach a place where it flows into a deeper, colder channel. Where the two rivers meet, the waters boil and seethe as they collide with a line of jagged, razor-edged rocks. Frantically you battle against the current as you are swept inexorably nearer to this treacherous reef.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Elementalism and wish to use it, <a href="#sect229">turn to 229</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy, have attained the Kai rank of Sun Knight, and wish to use your ability, <a href="#sect34">turn to 34</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect12">12</a></h3>

<p>You wait patiently near the entrance to the weapons laboratory where you observe the enemy attempting in vain to master the deadly devices they have discovered here. The portcullised arch offers the only way out of this hall, and you decide that you must attempt to reach it at the first opportunity. Your chance comes after a few minutes when one of the Shom’zaa minions naïvely scoops a clawful of sodium from a sealed clay pot, and then drops it into a pitcher of water. The resulting explosion decapitates the spawn-creature and creates a dense cloud of choking white smoke.</p>
<p>Under cover of the smoke, you enter the hall and steal past the enemy undetected. You are able to reach the middle of the laboratory before you are forced to take cover among a stack of oak barrels to avoid the gaze of the creature on the platform.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Assimilance, add 2 to the number you have picked. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 1.</p>

<h3><a name="sect13">13</a></h3>

<p>You leap across the slab, but the heel of your boot grazes the stone as you land and it triggers the trap. A panel in the ceiling ahead falls away to reveal a line of sharpened bone arrow-tips, angled to fire along the passage. You hear a sudden <i>whoosh</i> of escaping gas; then a volley of deadly shafts come streaking through the dusty air. Hurriedly you dive to the ground in an attempt to avoid being skewered by this salvo of ivory arrows.</p>

<h3><a name="sect14">14</a></h3>

<p>You have taken just two steps into the cavern when suddenly you are engulfed by a length of steel-hard thread. This thin, sticky wire whips around your legs and yanks you to the ground. As you fall, you glimpse a large creature affixed to the ceiling. It resembles a huge black beetle, with mandibles and a shiny shell that covers a pair of membranous hind wings. The thread extends from a bony tube beneath this horror’s gaping mouth. You struggle hard to break free from its deadly lasso, but the creature spins another length and loops it around your body. You gasp for air as this thread is pulled tighter.</p>

<h3><a name="sect15">15</a></h3>

<p>With great bravado, you throw back your head and treat the sneering lancers to a verse of the Sommlending national anthem. At first the Shom’zaa Agarashi view your singing with some amusement, but when you begin to raise the pitch of your voice, they realize too late that you are singing a deadly song. The frequency of the sonic attack that you launch rises to a pitch far beyond the range of normal hearing, and it cuts into the lancers’ minds like a hot knife through butter.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If your current <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score is 20 or higher, deduct 1 from the number you have picked.</p>

<h3><a name="sect16">16</a></h3>

<p>Gradually you become aware of the fact that your vision is blurred, and you no longer have any feeling in your fingers and toes.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Deliverance, <a href="#sect54">turn to 54</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="#sect193">turn to 193</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect17">17</a></h3>

<p>When you arrive at the pit, you quickly pull aside the planks that lie strewn across the opening. Peering down into the darkness, you glimpse the tangled wreckage of a cage lying at the bottom of the shaft, 60 feet below. Some of the Shom’zaa minions have now recovered their nerve and have regrouped at the edge of the quarry. Cautiously they begin to advance towards you, firing arrows as they move closer.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy, <a href="#sect76">turn to 76</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this Discipline, <a href="#sect180">turn to 180</a>.</p>

<p>The blazing tip of your Arrow hits and penetrates a powder keg. Moments later, there is a tremendous explosion as the platform is consumed by a searing ball of yellow and scarlet flame.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect130">Turn to 130</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect19">19</a></h3>

<p>You draw an Arrow and let it fly at the creature’s eyes, but as your shaft whistles towards its vile head, the beast slams its glowing fists together and catches it in mid-air. Instantly, the wooden shaft bursts into flames. It burns fiercely for just a few seconds before crumbling away to ash.</p>
<p>Fearful that the same thing will happen to you if you allow this creature to get too close, you retreat from the tomb and run across the chamber to the alcove. Quickly you pull the lever and a secret panel in the wall slides open to reveal a narrow passage beyond. Taking hold of the stonework that frames the panel, you pull yourself towards the narrow gap. You are only halfway through the opening when two orbs of living flame leap from the creature’s glowing fists and come arcing towards your spine.</p>

<h3><a name="sect21">21</a></h3>

<p>Suddenly you remember the Bronze Disc that you found in the ransacked storage room, and you pull it from your tunic pocket. The dwarven runes engraved on its bronze surface are identical to the ones that embellish the door buttons. Confident that they hold the key to the opening of this portal, you press the three buttons in descending order: 3–2–1.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect321">Turn to 321</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect22">22</a></h3>

<p>A cold shiver runs down your spine as you watch the mass of shrieking, wild-eyed horrors come charging across the cavern towards the Drodarin line. Their raw fury stands in stark contrast to the cool discipline of the War-thanes who wait to greet them with musket, cannon, and axe. Suddenly your eye is caught by a flash of blue light at the centre of the attacking horde. An icy blast of energy is launched and it strikes close to the cannon, freezing most of the crew. You magnify your vision and see a Shom’zaa Agarashi commander leading the charge. As he runs he holds his claw outstretched in readiness to launch a second blast at the Drodarin cannon. If he is allowed to succeed, and the cannon is silenced, Prince Torfan’s dwarves may be unable to turn back this determined attack.</p>

<h3><a name="sect23">23</a></h3>

<p>You remove the Tinderbox from your Backpack and grip it tightly in your fist. As soon as the way is clear, you leap out from behind the shield and dash towards the cannon. The Agarashi commander sees you breaking cover; it halts and turns. Then, with a disdainful laugh, it raises its clawed hand and takes careful aim at your fleeing form.</p>

<p>The blow hurls you forward and you strike your forehead on a stalagmite before splashing into the mire: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Your senses are screaming ‘Danger!’ as you struggle to your knees and wipe the slime from your bloodied nose and mouth. You reach for your Kai Weapon, but its blade is barely out of the scabbard when Shom’zaa leaps upon you and rakes you with his terrible claws.</p>

<p>Your blazing Arrow speeds towards the kegs, but the skeletal creature sees it approaching and it reacts swiftly to your deadly threat. It raises its clawed hand and launches an icy blast that freezes the Arrow in mid-air. Then the creature emits a loud, hellish shriek, and you feel a fiery pain welling up inside your skull as a powerful stream of destructive psychic energy batters your mind.</p>
<p>Rapidly the pressure builds in your head until your skull feels fit to burst. Your vision is clouded by a scarlet haze, and you are unable to stifle a cry of pain as you drop your Bow and collapse to your knees: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.<sup><a href="#sect25-1-foot" name="sect25-1">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Desperately you struggle to erect a defensive wall around the core of your mind, using your power of Psi-screen. Slowly, as your mental defences lock together, the pain eases and your vision clears. Through the receding red mist you see a group of Shom’zaa Agarashi stalking towards you with their swords drawn. You force yourself to stand, and you unsheathe your Kai Weapon just in time to meet their determined attack.</p>

To your dismay, you see that your route to the portcullised archway is now obstructed by a group of Agarashi minions.

<p>The dwarves of Bor are famed throughout Magnamund for their devotion to the technology of warfare. Drodarin engineers have for centuries produced ingenious weapons that utilize the power of explosive powders and inflammable fluids. The distant hall is one of King Ryvin’s weapons laboratories, and it contains a vast assortment of bombards, siege engines, and other mechanical devices of war. It also contains a host of Shom’zaa Agarashi who appear to be conducting experiments of their own, with devastatingly lethal results.</p>
<p>The tunnel shakes with the force of another explosion as you cautiously approach the entrance to the laboratory. Standing atop a wooden platform at the far side of the chamber, you see a thin skeletal creature, with charcoal-black skin and iridescent eyes. Like an orchestral conductor it issues directions to its minions scattered about the hall below. Many are killed carrying out the orders, yet they seem more afraid of incurring the creature’s wrath than of being blown apart by their inept handling of Drodarin explosives. Below the platform you can see an archway with a stone ramp that descends to a lower level. This exit from the laboratory is protected by a heavy wooden portcullis, yet the gate is raised and the archway is clear. You note that the portcullis is operated by a single rope and pulley.</p>
<p>Before you attempt to enter the hall, you consult the Bloodstone Andarin and see that the colours have become stronger since the last time you looked. Your Kai senses and the lights of this glowing gemstone both confirm that you are getting nearer to finding King Ryvin’s sons.</p>

Several cart tracks converge at the approach to a wide stone ramp that ascends to the mouth of an unguarded tunnel in the cavern wall. You climb the ramp and, as you enter this torchlit tunnel, you discover a number of broken weapons lying discarded on the ground. Among them you find 1 Arrow and a Sword that are still serviceable. (If you decide to keep them, adjust your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p>You follow the tunnel for several hundred yards until you come to a junction where a smaller passageway leads off to the right. A stone plaque that once indicated the name of this passage lies smashed in pieces. You are trying to put the pieces back together when suddenly you hear the sound of Brozal riders approaching along the main tunnel. Quickly you move into the shadowy passageway and use your camouflage skills to hide there as you wait for the riders to pass.</p>

<p>‘You sure ran pretty!’ says a bearded War-thane, as he slaps you heartily on the shoulder.</p>
<p>‘You just lost me ten Ain,’ says another, jokingly. ‘I bet old Borin that y’wouldn’t make it!’</p>
<p>These battle-hardened defenders are clearly impressed by your courage, and they are not too proud to show it. But then a gruff cry from the far end of the line sends them hurrying back to their positions: ‘Here they come again!’</p>
<p>A grey-bearded warrior, his arm bandaged in a makeshift sling, takes hold of your sleeve and pulls you away from the barricade as the Shom’zaa Agarashi launch another assault. He ushers you into the Throne Chamber of Andarin and, as you accompany him, he tugs something from your Backpack: it is the shaft of an enemy arrow.

<p>The basket lands at the base of the shaft and you see a freshly-excavated tunnel stretching away to the east. You leave the basket and, as you follow the prince, you notice that the walls of this passage are layered with a fibrous mineral that shimmers like strands of polished silver. Now you understand what tempted Leomin to defy ancient Drodarin lore and mine the lower levels of Bor, for these are strands of pure korlinium—the rarest of minerals. You feel its raw energy revitalizing you as you walk along the tunnel (restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points), yet you cannot help but conclude how foolish it was of Leomin to succumb to his temptation. For centuries the goodly power of this mineral has acted like the bars of a prison, keeping Shom’zaa and its horde secure.</p>
<p>At length you arrive at a small cavern where a section of wall has collapsed.</p>
<p>‘That is where the Shom’zaa horde emerged,’ says Leomin, pointing to the gaping hole. Mining tools litter the floor of this chamber, and you see a wider passage leading off to the south. It is laid with track for wagons to carry away the korlinium ore. When you magnify your vision, you see a group of Shom’zaa Agarashi at the far end of this passage.</p>

<p>By the use of your improved mastery of Assimilance, you are able to create a thunderous sound and project it directly above the heads of the Shom’zaa Agarashi guards. Fearing that the roof of the cavern is about to collapse upon them, they drop their spears and dive for the shelter of the tunnel. As they hit the ground, you leave the shadows and set off towards the archway at a run, building speed rapidly as you draw closer. With a mighty leap you clear their bodies and land in the cavern beyond.</p>
<p>Without looking back, you scramble to your feet and race towards the barricade. You are halfway across the chamber when, to your surprise and relief, you note that the only Shom’zaa minions who now occupy this hall are those lying dead on the ground around you.

<p>You follow this brick-lined tunnel for a mile before you reach a cavern that is filled with heat and noise. At its centre there stands a huge smelting furnace belching scarlet fire and evil-smelling gases. Great iron chutes feed the furnace with a stream of crushed ore, and from a vent at its base you see a river of molten copper flowing away along a great stone channel. The wagon track enters the cavern and passes beneath the channel before disappearing into a tunnel in the far wall.</p>
<p>Twenty of Shom’zaa’s minions occupy this smelting chamber where, with wicked glee, they amuse themselves by torturing dwarven warriors whom they have captured in battle. A wretched prisoner is hung from a chain and dangled above the blazing furnace until he succumbs to the heat and poisonous fumes. Then the body is fed to the fires and another is hoisted aloft to take his place.</p>

An iron sign is fixed to one of the planks, but its Drodarin runescript has been eaten away by acid. When you look closer, you determine that the sign was defaced by Shom’zaa himself. Traces of the acid are identical to the corrosive fluid that ate through Prince Leomin’s armour.</p>

The portcullised arch offers the only way out of this hall, and you decide that you must attempt to reach it at the first opportunity. Your chance comes after a few minutes when one of the Shom’zaa minions naïvely scoops a clawful of sodium from a sealed clay pot, and then drops it into a pitcher of water. The resulting explosion decapitates the spawn-creature and creates a dense cloud of choking white smoke.</p>

Leomin grabs you by the tunic and pulls you aside as he raises his battle-axe in readiness to hurl it at Shom’zaa’s hideous form. But before he can release the axe, he is felled by a stream of clear fluid intended for you. It strikes his chest and boils as it eats through his crimson breastplate.

<p>Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus thaws your frozen limbs and saves you from sustaining permanent damage to your feet and toes, but you are unable to move your legs effectively and you topple backwards to the ground.</p>
<p>Before the Shom’zaa Agarashi can rally themselves and attack you while you lie helpless upon the floor, you crawl away into a section of the vast laboratory that is crowded with siege machinery and engines of war. Here you take cover behind a large shield on wheels and observe the enemy milling in confusion. While you are watching them, you use your Kai healing skills to restore all feeling to your frost-numbed feet.</p>
<p>Suddenly their commander galvanizes their attention by freezing two luckless minions to death with another icy blast. When he then commands the portcullis to be lowered to prevent you from escaping, a zealous Agarashi rushes forward and begins hacking at its securing rope with a battle-axe. The rope snaps, and you watch with horror as the portcullis comes crashing down to seal off the exit.</p>

<p>An icy trickle of fear runs down your back when you turn to look upon the squat creature that is now framed in the doorway. It has a bloated, veined body and waxy skin that is as pale as a frozen corpse. From its fanged mouth there flickers a forked tongue, and its scarlet eye-slits radiate an evil light that chills you to the bone. It advances into the chamber with its arms outstretched, as if it is walking in its sleep. Then it turns and points its arms at you, and its clenched fists begin to glow like two balls of red-hot plasma.</p>

Drodarin marksmen hastily reload their muskets and let loose a parting volley to speed them on their way. But as the smoke from their firearms clears, you see that the battle is going against Prince Torfan’s War-thanes on the right flank of the barricade. The cannon, and Leomin’s battle-standard, have both been captured by a dozen Shom’zaa Agarashi. You watch with mounting horror as the enemy turn the captured cannon around and point it at the Throne of Andarin, and your fears are compounded when you sense that the gun is primed, loaded, and set ready to fire.</p>

<p>Carefully you tear a strip of cloth from the hem of your jacket, twist it into a taper, and grip it firmly in your fist. Then you begin to make your way slowly towards the workbench.

As soon as the way is clear, you leap up from behind the bench and dash towards the cannon, the burning taper held before you at arm’s length.</p>

Then the door bursts open and out they pour with a blood-curdling yell. You move aside to avoid being trampled as they rush to the ore wagons and arm themselves with rocks and tools. The torturers abandon their grisly work and come running towards the prison cage with their weapons raised. Three of these heartless minions target you.

<p>You learn that the princes and their bodyguard of War-thanes have held the throne chamber for six days. They have no food or water, and it is only the radiant power of the throne that has sustained them. Prince Leomin knows the precise location of Shom’zaa’s lair and he will lead you to it. You agree to go with him while Prince Torfan remains here to command the defence of the throne chamber.</p>
<p>Leomin takes you to a stone door set flush into the curving marble wall. A grizzled old warrior sits guard at this portal, and clutched in his vein-covered hands is a glowing runestone. Your Kai senses detect that this door is sealed by an Old Kingdom Spell that has prevented Shom’zaa’s horde from gaining entry to the chamber by this way. Prince Leomin unsheathes his battle-axe and motions you to draw your Weapon before the door is opened.</p>
<p>‘Shom’zaa abandoned his attempt to batter down this portal two days past,’ he says. ‘But there may be some of his spawn-kind waiting in the corridor outside. Best be on our guard, Kai Lord.’</p>
<p>Leomin nods to the old warrior and he responds by touching the runestone to the door. There is a faint tinkling sound, and then the portal slides open and you follow the prince as he steps through the opening into the darkened passageway beyond. The portal slides shut behind your back with hardly a sound. Instinctively you scan your new surroundings for signs of the enemy, and quickly discover that Leomin was right to be cautious. More than a dozen Shom’zaa Agarashi have been left here to guard the portal. Only by chance have you chosen a time to leave the chamber when these creatures are asleep.</p>
<p>Leomin points to the end of the wide corridor, to a place where a circular shaft descends to a lower level. A large basket, suspended by a rope and pulley, hangs above this shaft. The prince beckons you to follow as he tiptoes around the sleeping creatures and approaches the basket. You are halfway along the corridor when suddenly one of the Shom’zaa Agarashi awakens and shrieks in alarm. You respond by racing towards the distant shaft, but within a matter of seconds, all of the sleeping creatures are on their feet and rushing from all sides to block your escape. You must fight them.</p>

Then you hear the loud report of muskets and pistols as Drodarin marksmen give covering fire from their barricade.</p>

<p>The destruction of the platform creates a pall of dense grey smoke, and its smouldering fragments set off a chain-reaction of smaller explosions all around the hall. Suddenly the Shom’zaa minions are gripped by a blind panic. They rush in every direction, clawing and biting at each other in their frenzy to escape the explosions and flames. You seize the opportunity to make a dash for the archway, and skilfully you weave your way through the chaos, felling all who dare stand in your way. When you reach the portcullis, you lower your head and hurry down the stone ramp to the level below.</p>

<p>After a few minutes the minions cease firing and the pit shaft echoes to the sound of their distant, gurgling laughter. Cautiously you move to the middle of the chamber, to where a line of empty ore wagons stand on a sleepered track. This track curves in the centre and exits the chamber through brick-lined tunnels in the north and east walls. Beside the north tunnel exit you see an iron door with a broken lock.</p>
<p>You unbutton the neck of your tunic and look at the Andarin Bloodstone in the hope it may help you choose the best route to follow. Its amber and crimson halves are glowing a little brighter now, but when you point the gemstone at each tunnel exit in turn, there is no variation. Looking down, you see that there are many tracks in the dusty ground. Some have been made by booted Drodarin feet, but mostly they are the clawed footprints of Shom’zaa’s minions. Then you apply your Kai Sixth Sense and you detect danger lurking along both tunnels.</p>

Fearing discovery, you unsheathe your Kai Weapon in anticipation of trouble as the bronze portal slowly swings open.</p>

You can hear the approach of heavy footfalls in the passageway outside, and your pulse races as you scour the chamber in a desperate search for something that can be used to secure the unlocked door.</p>
<p>You find the saucer-like top of a burial urn lying beside Andarin’s tomb, and you jam this bronze lid into the gap beneath the door in the hope that it will wedge the portal shut. Suddenly the door shudders as something hits it with tremendous force. The bronze lid crumples, yet miraculously it prevents the door from flying open.</p>

In your haste to escape, you forget to use your innate Pathsmanship skills to cover your tracks, and within a minute of first sighting you the riders are able to pick up your trail.</p>
<p>The sound of them crashing through the wheat alerts you to the need for you to hide your tracks. You change direction repeatedly, and use your Kai skills to weave through the crops without leaving any sign of your passing. This tactic throws most of them off your scent, but one rider follows his instincts and he homes in on you with uncanny precision.</p>

This store has recently been ransacked by Shom’zaa’s minions and little has survived intact. Amidst the heaped and broken wreckage you find only two unbroken items: a Shovel and a Pick.</p>
<p>When you turn to leave the store room, you notice a tattered leather jerkin hanging on a hook behind the door. In a pocket you discover a Bronze Disc that is stamped with the Drodarin numerals ‘3–2–1’. You sense that the disc could be useful and so you slip it into your pocket before leaving the store room.

This timely action saves you from being scorched by the searing heat of the missile as it whooshes past and explodes among the treasures stored in this chamber.</p>
<p>As the fire dies out, you hear another sound—the dull <i>clunk!</i> of a trap being activated. You glance back into the passageway and see that your pursuer has stepped on a weighted floor slab, triggering a volley of deadly arrows. Unable to turn in the narrow confines of the passage, it is skewered by more than a dozen of these bone-tipped shafts. With a hellish shriek, the creature’s corpulent body erupts into a great ball of flame that burns with such fierce intensity that the beast is quickly reduced to a heap of white-hot ash.</p>

<p>The frequency of the sonic attack that you launch is far beyond the range of normal hearing, yet it cuts into the lancers’ minds like a hot knife through butter. They drop their spears and begin writhing in their saddles, clawing at their skulls in a vain attempt to put an end to the agony.

<p>The dwarves seize their chance to escape from the cage. Before the creature can get to its feet, a hand reaches through the bars and the bolt is pulled. Then the door bursts open and out they pour with a blood-curdling yell. The surviving guard is trampled underfoot as the dwarves rush to the ore wagons and arm themselves with rocks and tools. The torturers abandon their grisly work and come running towards the prison cage with their weapons raised. Suddenly two of these minions appear beside your wagon.

But Shom’zaa has one other bodyguard, and a sudden noise from the wall of the chamber behind you draws your attention to its daunting presence.</p>
<p>You spin around to see the slime-smeared rock-face rippling and undulating, as if a wave is passing through it. Then, in stunned disbelief, you watch the rocks move and take form. From out of the wall steps a creature formed wholly of stone. It has taken the shape of a large human, with fists that resemble two great hammers. It pounds the ground as it comes lumbering towards you, pulverising the surface. Bravely, Prince Leomin raises his axe, and with his battle-cry upon his lips, he lands a flurry of heavy blows upon the creature’s chest and neck. The rock beast retaliates with a backhanded swipe. It connects with Leomin’s head and leaves him sprawled upon the floor, unconscious and bleeding. Hurriedly you slip the Sun-crystal back into your pocket as the lumbering beast advances upon you.</p>

<p>Quickly the prince hooks the blade of his great axe behind the wiry threads that constrict and bind you, and with one swift pull, he severs them and releases you. As your strength slowly returns, you thank Leomin for his timely rescue and take stock of the damage the lassos of thread have caused.</p>

<p>Your mind is so clouded by the fear that the creature may launch another fireball at your fleeing back, that you fail to see you are running towards a deadly trap. One of the dusty stone slabs which pave this narrow passageway is set to trigger the trap when any weight is placed upon it. The moment you tread on the slab, a panel in the ceiling ahead drops down to reveal a line of sharpened bone arrow-tips, angled to fire along the passage. You hear a sudden <i>whoosh</i> of escaping gas; then a volley of deadly shafts comes streaking through the dusty air. Instinctively you throw yourself to the ground in an attempt to avoid being skewered by this salvo of ivory arrows.</p>

<p>On passing through the portal, you pause to pull it shut and lock it behind you. The tunnel continues and you follow its central wagon track as gently it descends through the ore-rich rock. After several minutes, you detect a noise like distant thunder rumbling in the passageway ahead. You proceed with caution now, and gradually this low, thunderous noise becomes a series of separate concussive bangs. Soon you catch sight of a lantern-lit hall in the far distance. You stop to magnify your vision, and then you see at once that it harbours the source of the loud explosions.</p>

The entrance arch is open and unguarded but, as you draw nearer, a group of spear-wielding Shom’zaa Agarashi are alerted by the shrieks of their comrades in ‘The Hub’. They move swiftly to block the archway and trap you in the tunnel.

Their senses have been restored, and with them comes a blind fear of your deadly sonic skills. You call upon your mastery of Animal Control and command one of them to calm itself. It responds to your mental suggestions, even though its companions turn and flee for their lives. As they crash through the crops that line the southern perimeter of the clearing, you summon the Brozal to approach you. It responds with calm obedience. Deftly you climb onto the creature’s scaly back and settle yourself in the saddle. Then you turn it towards the east and urge it to enter the tall wheat. Carefully you skirt around the area of blazing crops before heading away to the north.</p>
<p>The Brozal lopes through the yellow stalks with a swift and easy gait, and you cover ground at a far swifter pace than would be possible on foot. But when you come unexpectedly to a muddy ditch which marks the boundary between the wheat and a neighbouring crop of barley, the Brozal misses its footing. It stumbles badly and you are thrown headlong from the saddle.</p>

An icy trickle of fear runs down your spine when you peek over the tomb and look upon the squat creature that is now framed in the doorway. It has a bloated, veined body and waxy skin that is as pale as a frozen corpse. From its fanged mouth there flickers a forked tongue, and its scarlet eye-slits radiate an evil light that chills the marrow in your bones.

<p>The open portal reveals a great stone staircase that descends to a magnificent marble hall. Vast columns brace the sculptured ceiling and tall silvery mirrors line the walls, creating the illusion that this cavernous chamber is even larger. Seated upon a chair in the centre of the echoing hall is King Ryvin, clad in his golden battle-armour and wolfskin cape. Surrounding him are members of his royal family and other high-ranking Drodarin nobility. They are greatly distressed and several are weeping openly. A herald announces your arrival and the crowd parts as you approach the foot of Ryvin’s chair.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XII]</div>
<p>‘Praise Ishir!’ booms the dwarf king. ‘We have prayed that you would return to aid us, Lord Rimoah. And I see you bring a Kai champion. We are doubly glad. You’ve arrived not a moment too soon.’</p>
<p>King Ryvin rises from his chair and motions to you and Rimoah to accompany him into an antechamber. In the privacy of this adjoining room, he tells of the nightmare that has engulfed his kingdom following the release of Shom’zaa. The creature and its horde of mutant spawn have spread like a voracious plague throughout the chambers and tunnels of his vast subterranean realm. All contact with the Drodarin communities surrounding Boradon has been severed, the lower levels of the kingdom have been lost to the enemy, and more than half of his army are unaccounted for.</p>
<p>‘So many have been slain,’ he says, his deep voice cracking with emotion. ‘Only the swift destruction of Shom’zaa can save us now. But all is not yet lost. I draw strength from the certain knowledge that my sons—Leomin and Torfan—are still alive, and the Throne of Andarin is intact.’</p>

Suddenly, a swarm of large wasp-like insects pour out of this hole and encircle the basket. The lower stripy sections of their bodies begin to glow as they gather together in a cloud and hover menacingly above you.</p>
<p>‘Antah wasps!’ exclaims Leomin, as he frantically works the rope and drops the basket at a stomach-churning speed. The wasps give chase, but when you call upon your improved Discipline of Pathsmanship and command them to disperse, they return immediately to their nest in the wall of the shaft.</p>
<p>Prince Leomin is impressed and, for the first time in many days, a smile creases his sullen face. He commends your skill as he slows the rope and lowers the basket gently to the base of the shaft.</p>

<p>You follow Lord Rimoah out onto the windswept deck and look down in awe at the mighty city of Boradon. Rooted directly in the granite escarpment of Andar, the highest mountain of the Great Bor Range, its fortifications and turrets are barely distinguishable from the rugged copper-red cliffs surrounding them. Night has fallen and the moonless sky is as black as jet, yet the crew of the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> have no difficulty in locating the approach to this ancient mountain metropolis. Torches burn in every turret and arrow slit, and blazing beacons illuminate a safe passage through the snow-capped peaks to the city’s central square.</p>
<p>A unit of King Ryvin’s élite War-thanes have been stationed in the main square in anticipation of your arrival. Their captain, a robust-looking dwarf with a plaited beard and a shock of bright red hair, offers you both a hearty welcome when you step from the boarding cage. He says that King Ryvin is waiting and he bids you accompany him without delay. His torch-bearing warriors escort you along a winding path that ends at a stone bridge which arches across a deep, natural moat. Beyond the bridge is a great bronze portal set into the mountainside. A horn sounds as you approach and the huge door swings open to reveal a wondrous sight.</p>

But it quickly recovers, and then it comes lumbering towards you with both its fiery fists raised.</p>

<p>With Prince Leomin watching your back, you cautiously explore this stinking hive. Beyond the cocoons you come to an adjoining cavern where a rough stone ramp descends to a sunken floor, ankle-deep in brackish slime. Clusters of large grey eggs are attached to conical stalagmites, and the surface of the mire is littered with the remnants of these leathery grey sacs. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that these torn egg pouches once contained the creatures that are now wreaking havoc in the dwarven kingdom.</p>
<p>You approach the edge of the stone ramp and come to an abrupt halt when you detect an overpowering aura of evil. You cast your eye across the field of stalagmites and your blood runs cold when you catch your first glimpse of Shom’zaa lurking in the darkness. He is a four-legged being, and his great head is triangular in form. Two pale green, radiant eyes are set above a three-cornered mouth filled with crystalline fangs. Below his jaw protrudes a slender proboscis, and from the crown of his bony skull sprout antenna tipped with barbed spikes. Slime drips from his every pore, sheening his leprous hide.</p>
<p>At first Shom’zaa appears not to have sensed your presence in his lair. Busily he tends to a batch of Agarashi eggs, injecting them with fluid from his proboscis to encourage them to hatch. But when you remove the Sun-crystal from your pocket and get ready to hurl it at his loathsome form, suddenly he senses danger and retreats among the stalagmites. As he withdraws, he emits a sound that is beyond the range of human hearing.</p>

When the opportunity presents itself, I advise you to throw the crystal at Shom’zaa, or cause the creature to touch it unwittingly. It is vital that you maintain your distance, for when the power of the crystal is released there will be a great implosion. If you are too close to your enemy at this crucial moment, you will risk being sucked into the vortex that the implosion will create.’</p>

An icy trickle of fear runs down your spine when you peek over the tomb and look upon the squat creature that is now framed in the doorway. It has a bloated, veined body and waxy skin that is as pale as a frozen corpse. From its fanged mouth there flickers a forked tongue, and its scarlet eye-slits radiate an evil light that chills the marrow in your bones. As it advances into the chamber with its arms outstretched, you swallow hard with disbelief when you see that its clenched fists are glowing white-hot.

<p>After a few minutes, the shuddering vibrations subside and the deluge of rock abates. Blindly you drag yourself along the ground, through clouds of choking dust. When the dust finally settles, you look back to see that the tunnel has been sealed off completely.</p>
<p>Fearful that another rockfall could occur at any time, you pull yourself to your feet and press on. You have covered just a few hundred yards when you come to a place where the tunnel turns to the north. Beyond this curve you catch sight of a lantern-lit hall in the far distance. You stop to magnify your vision; then you see that the distant cavern contains the cause of the explosions that have disrupted this section of King Ryvin’s copper mines.</p>

<p>As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you gasp with horror at what you see in the cavern before you. Hanging from the slime-stained ceiling are hundreds of large, grey cocoons. Through the wiry threads that form their fibrous shell cases, you can see the faces and features of Drodarin warriors. Your throat tightens when you realize that their corpses are being kept here to provide future food for Shom’zaa and his horde.</p>

<h3><a name="sect250">250</a></h3>

<p>The sounds of fighting grow louder as you explore the depths of this tunnel. Frequently you have to hide in the shadows to avoid colliding with ragged groups of wounded Agarashi retreating from battle. But at length you come to a large cavern that serves as the anteroom to the throne chamber of Andarin.</p>
<p>From the cover of a stone column beside the tunnel exit, you observe the deadly struggle that is taking place in this smoke-filled cavern. Scores of dead Agarashi are heaped before the entrance to the distant throne chamber. Its great double doors have been torn from their hinges, yet entry has been denied to the Shom’zaa horde. A barricade fills the open doorway, and this makeshift wall is being skilfully defended by the War-thanes of Prince Leomin and Prince Torfan.</p>
<p>An assault on the throne chamber is about to take place. You watch with grim fascination as the Agarashi rise up from positions they have dug around the perimeter of the cavern, and wait for their commander to shriek the order to attack. A wailing cry echoes around the cavern as the horde rushes headlong towards the barricade. They come to within a few paces of the wall before the leading ranks are obliterated by a cannon’s shell and a deafening volley of Bor pistols. There is a brief clash of swords and spears, followed by an ominous silence. From out of the smoke and carnage, the few who have survived the attack come crawling back to their trenches to lick their wounds and await the next assault.</p>
<p>Soon you hear the approach of enemy reinforcements, their ill-fitting armour rattling as they come running along the tunnel. You are forced to move away from the column for fear of being seen when they arrive but, as you scurry to the cover of an empty powder barrel, you are spotted by a group of Shom’zaa minions in a trench near the cavern wall. They cry out to their comrades, alerting them of your presence as they fumble to load their captured crossbows.</p>

<p>You force yourself in among the barrels and draw upon your camouflage skills to mask your body heat and scent. As the smoke clears, the misshapen creatures scurry back to their deadly experiments, urged on by the shrieks of their cadaverous lieutenant. To your dismay, you see that your route to the portcullised archway is no longer clear. It is obstructed by a group of minions that are attempting to dismantle a siege catapult and a two-wheeled field cannon. You quickly realize that if you are to have any chance of escaping from this laboratory alive, you will have to engineer another diversion.</p>
<p>You scan the archway and its surrounding area but to no avail. Then you look up at the creature on the platform and you notice that it is standing beside a stack of wooden kegs. Branded on these kegs in Drodarin script are two words: Blasting Powder. You allow yourself a wry smile, for if you were able to ignite these kegs of powder, it would create all the diversion you need.</p>

You call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship to decipher their meaning and you discover that they are numbers: 1, 2, and 3. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that this portal can be made to open if you press the three numbered buttons in the correct order.</p>

<p>Hurriedly you disentangle yourself from the bodies of your slain foes, but when you scramble to your feet and turn towards the cannon, you find yourself staring at the black claw of the Agarashi commander. There is a sudden flash of blue light, and in a terrifying instant you are paralysed by a freezing blast of energy. As consciousness ebbs and fades, the last sound you hear is the commander’s cruel, alien laughter.</p>

<p>You descend the stone ramp and tread carefully through the shallow slime that covers the floor of this lair. As you stalk towards Shom’zaa’s hiding place, you recall Lord Rimoah’s words of warning: you must not be too close to the creature when the Sun-crystal touches his body, or you will risk being consumed when the crystal’s energy is released.</p>
<p>The memory of his wise words makes you pause in mid-step and reconsider your actions. You have not taken your eyes away from the stalagmite since you stepped off the stone ramp, yet you sense that something is wrong. You look again, and suddenly the glimpse that you can see of Shom’zaa’s head begins to fade. Your throat tightens when you realize that you have been stalking an illusion. As you turn to go back to the ramp, you are suddenly struck in the back by a terrific force.</p>

To fight these creatures would be suicidal for they number more than a hundred. Your only hope of survival lies at the barricade.</p>
<p>You spring to your feet and race across the body-strewn ground towards the distant throne chamber. As you emerge from a cloud of cannon smoke drifting across the cavern, the dwarven defenders see you approaching. Some of them recognize you are a Kai Lord by the cut and colour of your tunic, and a hearty cheer arises from the barricade. Arrows and crossbow bolts whistle past as the Shom’zaa horde attempts to prevent you from reaching the throne chamber alive.

<p>You hear the Brozal slowing as they draw near to the junction, and your skin prickles with a premonition of danger. Your Kai senses detect the approach of a malevolent entity, a creature in their company that is exuding a powerful aura of evil. Fearing that you may be discovered if you stay here, you silently slip away along the passage.</p>
<p>Soon you arrive at a great bronze door. It is inlaid with ancient Drodarin runes and embellished with gold leaf. Gently you push against its cold surface, and the portal swings open to reveal a gloomy chamber. You sense no threat here and so you enter and then push the door closed behind you.</p>
<p>The walls of this chamber are lined with alcoves which are filled with ornate burial urns. Some have been smashed, and their powdery contents lie scattered upon the marble floor. You quickly determine that you have entered a Drodarin cinerarium—a place where the cremated remains of dwarven warriors are laid to rest. Such chambers are considered sacred by the Drodarin, and it saddens you to see that this one has been wantonly desecrated by Shom’zaa minions.</p>
<p>A large tomb dominates the centre of the chamber. Its lid is cracked and holed where the minions have attempted to force an entry. Drodarin script embellishes its dusty surfaces, and when you make a closer inspection, your pulse quickens. This is the tomb of Andarin—the first King of Bor. Through a small hole that punctures the tomb’s lid, you can see part of the king’s burial urn. It is lit by the supernatural glow of a golden warhammer that rests beside it. Your Kai senses detect that this is a powerful, magical weapon.</p>

<p>You raise your hands and rapidly recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Counterspell</i>. The air shimmers before your face as the spell takes effect, and the deadly blast of ice is transformed into a harmless stream of lukewarm water.</p>
<p>Your unexpected use of magic to counter the creature’s icy attack shocks the watching minions. Nervously they back away, defying the hysterical shrieking of their cadaverous commander who orders them to attack you <i xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>. Before they can rally themselves and carry out the order, you steal away into a section of the vast laboratory that is crowded with siege machinery and engines of war. Here you take cover behind a large shield on wheels and observe the Shom’zaa minions as they mill about in confusion.</p>
<p>Suddenly their commander recaptures their attention by freezing two luckless minions to death with another icy blast. When he then commands the portcullis to be lowered to prevent your escape, a zealous minion rushes forward and begins hacking at its securing rope with a battle-axe. The rope snaps, and you watch with horror as the portcullis comes crashing down to seal off the exit.</p>

<p>The only exit from this place is the natural tunnel in the west wall, through which the underground river flows away. Carefully you test the water and discover that it is hot, although not unbearably so. You resolve to try to escape from the cavern by way of this river, and before you lower yourself into its steamy water, you make sure that all of your Weapons and equipment are secure. Upon entering the river you are carried away by the swift current and swept beneath the tunnel’s low arch.</p>

Suddenly the portal bursts open and slams against the wall with a tremendous crash. An icy trickle of fear runs down your back when you peek over the tomb and look upon the squat creature that is now framed in the doorway. It has a bloated, veined body and waxy skin that is as pale as a frozen corpse. From its fanged mouth there flickers a forked tongue, and its scarlet eye-slits radiate an evil light that chills the marrow in your bones.

<p>The stone ramp leads to a titanic, lantern-lit cavern, where acres of wheat and barley are ripening in fields of fertile soil. You are amazed that such rich arable land can exist so deep below the surface of Magnamund, where rain has never fallen and the sun has never shone. Truly the Goddess Ishir gave the Drodarin a wondrous gift when she bestowed upon them the Throne of Andarin, for its powers alone permit this miracle to exist.</p>
<p>You leave the ramp and follow a rutted cart track. It borders upon a field of tall wheat, swaying gently in a cooling breeze. As you walk along, you magnify your vision and attempt to judge the distance to the far wall of the cavern. You have just concluded that it lies more than two miles ahead when suddenly you see something in the middle distance that makes you freeze in your tracks. A group of six large, two-footed creatures have emerged from the wheat field. At first glance they remind you of the guanza, the racing lizards bred in the Southlands, but when you take a closer look you see that these grey-skinned mounts are not born of natural stock. Astride their scaly backs sit Shom’zaa minions armed with spears and lances. The leading rider sights you on the track and immediately the group comes speeding towards you with a loose, loping gait.</p>

<p>You escape along the dark tunnel at a run, your footsteps pounding in time to the beat of your heart as you race to put distance between yourself and the smelting cavern. Then a great bronze portal looms out of the darkness ahead, blocking the passage. It creaks open as you approach it and four muscular minions appear, framed in the glow of the torchlit tunnel that lies beyond. These creatures are larger than those you have encountered so far, and their reptilian eyes glint with a malevolent light that betrays their intelligence and ruthless cunning. They snicker with delight as they unsheathe their bladed weapons and rush forward to cut you down.</p>

<p>Before the Shom’zaa Agarashi can rally themselves and attack you while you lie stunned upon the floor, you crawl away into a section of the vast laboratory that is crowded with siege machinery and engines of war. Here you take cover behind a large shield on wheels and observe the enemy milling in confusion. While you are watching them, you use your Kai healing skills to restore all feeling to your frost-numbed arm.</p>
<p>Suddenly their commander galvanizes their attention by freezing two luckless minions to death with another icy blast. When he then commands the portcullis to be lowered to prevent you from escaping, a zealous Agarashi rushes forward and begins hacking at its securing rope with a battle-axe. The rope snaps, and you watch with horror as the portcullis comes crashing down to seal off the exit.</p>

They are in jubilant mood after six days of siege, for they believe that the retreat of their enemy from around the throne chamber signals the end of their long ordeal. Prince Torfan offers you his hand and helps lift you over the wall, and then he asks after his brother Leomin. You answer with a shake of your bowed head.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XVIII]</div>
<p>Torfan is saddened by the news of the loss of his brother, but as you accompany him into the throne chamber, he is greatly comforted to hear that you owe him your life.</p>

<p>You follow the stocky Drodarin warrior out of the great hall and along a passageway that leads to the entrance of a vast, lantern-lit tunnel. Four large wolves are harnessed to a chariot parked alongside the tunnel wall, and these great grey beasts whine excitedly when they see Vagel appear. The captain leaps into the chariot and beckons you to join him. As soon as you are safely aboard, he grabs the wide leather reins and sets the wolves running.<sup><a href="#sect318-1-foot" name="sect318-1">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Tenaciously you cling to the chariot’s rail as Vagel hurls his two-wheeled transport through a seemingly endless succession of titanic caverns, and you marvel at the scale and diversity of this subterranean kingdom, for it is far greater than you had ever imagined possible. You see farmsteads with cattle and crops, rivers laden with fish, mines rich with silver and rare minerals, and wells brimming with oil to fuel the great lanterns of this vast underground realm. But among the many wonders of Bor you also see some of the tragedy that has befallen the Drodarin race. Many of the dwellings you pass have been destroyed or abandoned, and groups of battle-weary dwarf warriors sit huddled and dejected in their ruins, nursing their wounds.</p>
<p>Beyond the smoking shell of a house, you arrive at the entrance to a sloping tunnel that descends to a quarry and copper mine. The site looks abandoned, but when you emerge from the tunnel, your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship screams a warning that you are heading into an ambush. You shout at Vagel to turn the chariot about, but before he can obey your command, a volley of arrows whistle down from the surrounding rocks. One of the wolves is killed instantly, causing the chariot to swerve out of control. Then the left wheel shatters upon hitting a boulder, and in the blink of an eye you are sent tumbling headlong through the air.</p>

<p>Upon returning to the cavern, you enter the south tunnel and follow the newly-laid wagon track to a junction where a smaller passage leads off to the right. The entrance to this smaller tunnel is blocked by a criss-cross of timbers. An iron sign is fixed to one of the planks, but its Drodarin runescript has been eaten away by acid. When you look closer, you determine that the sign was defaced by Shom’zaa himself. Traces of the acid are identical to the corrosive fluid that ate through Prince Leomin’s armour.</p>

In the distance, you glimpse the opening to a chamber that is crowded with objects that glitter enticingly in the half-light. When you magnify your vision, you realize with some amazement that you are running towards a secret Drodarin treasure vault.</p>
<p>The sound of falling masonry alerts you to a renewed danger: the creature is attempting to pursue you. Chunks of crumbling plaster are being dislodged from the walls as the creature forces its bloated body along the narrow passageway.</p>

<p>You take an Arrow from your Quiver and grip it tightly by the flighted end. Then you whisper the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <i>Flameshaft</i> and a blue flame ignites at its steel tip. As soon as the way is clear, you leap out from behind the shield and dash towards the cannon, with the burning arrow held before you at arm’s length.</p>
<p>The Agarashi commander sees you breaking cover; it halts and turns. Then, with a disdainful laugh, it raises its clawed hand and takes careful aim at your fleeing form.</p>

<p>You speak the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i> and take aim with your right arm at the lizard-faced creature. A tingle of energy runs down your arm and a flash of blue light explodes from your fingertips. A bolt of electrical power surges from your hand and hits the beast in the torso, hurling it backwards to the ground. As it falls, it strikes its head on a protruding rock and is knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>Its followers freeze in their tracks and look to their fallen leader with shocked surprise. When he fails to rise, they are gripped by a sudden panic that makes them drop their weapons and run. You seize this chance to break cover and race towards the pit shaft at the base of the quarry’s north wall.</p>

<p>The creature suddenly stops in mid-stride and turns towards Prince Leomin. As its crushing feet tread a slow, deliberate path towards the prince’s head, you unsheathe your Kai Weapon and rush forward in a desperate attempt to halt the creature’s advance.</p>

<p>You speak the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Strength</i> and as it begins to take effect, you feel an invigorating surge of power flowing through every muscle of your body. Electrified by this energy, you take hold of the tomb’s lid and force it aside. There is a loud <i>Crack!</i> as the seal of grime is broken; then a flood of golden light washes over you when you swing the lid aside and tip it over onto the floor.</p>
<p>With a growing sense of awe, you take hold of the golden warhammer and raise it aloft. You admire its finely-crafted lines and perfect balance, and you sense that it was forged by magical fires.</p>

<p>If you wish to keep the Andarin Warhammer, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. In combat against any enemy it will give you a bonus of +5 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. You may use this magical warhammer as an alternative to your Kai Weapon.</p>

<p>Rapidly the pressure builds in your head until your skull feels fit to burst. Your vision is clouded by a scarlet haze, and you are unable to stifle a cry of pain as you collapse to your knees: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Desperately you struggle to erect a defensive wall around the core of your mind, using your power of Psi-screen. Slowly, as your mental defences lock together, the pain eases and your vision clears. Through the receding red mist you see a group of Shom’zaa Agarashi closing in on you with their swords drawn. You force yourself to stand, and you unsheathe your Kai Weapon just in time to meet their determined attack.</p>

<p>The icy bolt hits the wall of hot air and explodes in a great cloud of steam. Your effective use of Kai Elementalism to counter the icy blast shocks the Shom’zaa commander. His nerve breaks and he turns and flees, with his minions following closely on his heels. Soon they have disappeared from sight and a deathly silence descends upon the tunnel.</p>

<p>You press your back against the door and recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Strength</i>. As the spell takes effect, you feel an invigorating surge of power flowing through every sinew of your body. Energized by this magical power, you lean back and press with all your might to keep the portal shut. There is another blow on the door, but it fails to shift you. Then you feel the surface temperature of the portal is changing; it is getting hotter.</p>

<p>Your killing blow pitches the Shom’zaa lancer out of its saddle and sends its lifeless body tumbling into the wheat, trailing a stream of black ichor. As its steed flees through the tall crops, you notice a bulb-like object fall from its saddlebag. You take a closer look and discover that it is an unexploded Phosphor Bomb. (If you wish to keep this item, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.) Then you hear the sound of the other riders approaching, and quickly you dive into the tall crops and hurry away towards the north to avoid them.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, when you can no longer hear the lancers crashing through the wheat, you begin to feel confident that they have lost your trail for good. You have just crossed into an adjoining crop of barley when suddenly a barrier of piercing light erupts in front of you as first one explosion and then two more detonate among the plants. In a desperate attempt to flush you out, the riders are hurling phosphor bombs into the fields. Within seconds the tinder-dry crops are ablaze, fanned by a stiff breeze. You retreat to the wheat field to avoid the roaring flames but, as you retrace your steps, your Sixth Sense tells you that you are being forced back into a trap.</p>

<p>As you run towards the archway, you shape your mouth in readiness to utter the Old Kingdom power-word: <i>Gloar!</i> The force of your spell-word punches a hole in their ranks, sending those in the middle cartwheeling backwards into the chamber beyond.

<p>An icy blast from the creature’s claw collides with your lightning bolt in mid-air and deflects it from the target.

<p>A special escort is provided for you and Lord Rimoah. In the company of Prince Torfan, you are taken by carriage to the Grand Hall where a magnificent reception awaits you. Formally you are presented to King Ryvin and you receive his praise and heartfelt thanks for the victory you have secured for his beleaguered kingdom. You return to him the Andarin Bloodstone, and he awards to you the Cross of Boradon—the highest accolade for courage and gallantry in the Kingdom of Bor. During the informal celebrations that take place shortly afterwards, you are further awarded the freedom of Bor and the honorary rank and title of War-thane—a rare privilege for one not born of Drodarin stock. (Erase the Andarin Bloodstone from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>After a day of rest, you and Lord Rimoah make a triumphant return to Sommerlund aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. The news of your victory has travelled ahead of you and your arrival at the monastery is greeted by the appreciative cheers of your fellow kinsmen. For your triumph over Shom’zaa, and the preservation of the Throne of Andarin, you receive special praise and admiration from Supreme Master Lone Wolf himself.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. You have met this testing quest and you have triumphed. Your brave and courageous actions in Bor will long be remembered in the legends of the New Order Kai. Yet the fight against Evil has not yet ended. Soon your courage and Kai skills will be put to the test again, in a distant realm of Magnamund. The nature of the quest and the dangers that await you will be revealed in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure entitled:</p>
