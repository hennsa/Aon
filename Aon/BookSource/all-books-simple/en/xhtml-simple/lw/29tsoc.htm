 <div class="frontmatter">

    <p>The Forces of Darkness have launched a coordinated assault upon the Free Nations of Magnamund. Their intentions are clear: to overwhelm and annihilate them before an effective counter-offensive can be undertaken.</p>

    <p>In <strong><cite>The Storms of Chai</cite></strong>, your mission is one of seven that Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf has initiated to turn back this unprecedented tide of evil before it engulfs all the goodly nations of Magnamund forever.</p>

    <p>Will you succeed in your vital quest to retrieve the Eye of Agarash from the city of Pensei and bring it back safely to the Kai Monastery of Lorn, or will you fall victim to the powerful Nadziran Zashnor and the terrible creatures at his command?</p>

  
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold over 11 million copies around the world.</p>

   <p>Beginning in 1996, Joe worked in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>

   <p>In late 1999, Joe gave his readers his millennium gift by sharing his works freely through what became Project Aon. Other creators added their own gifts to his: Gary Chalk,  Brian Williams, Ian Page, Rob Adams, Paul Bonner, Melvyn Grant, Richard Hook, Peter Andrew Jones, Cyril Julien, Peter Lyon, Trevor Newton, Peter Parr, and Graham Round.</p>

   <p>After a brave and private ten-year battle with illness, Joe Dever passed away in November 2016 leaving behind a legacy of goodness and honour that has earned him a loyal, enduring following among the readers who continue to find adventure in the worlds he created.</p>

<h2><a name="timeline">Timeline of Notable Events in Magnamund</a></h2>

<dl>
<dt>MS 5085 Bhanar and Chai</dt>
<dd>The vampiric Autarch Sejanoz of Bhanar was destroyed. Khea-khan Xo-lin of Chai rallied the New Kingdom armies, defeated the invading Bhanarian army and pursued it deep into the Bhanarian homeland. Xo-lin’s son, General Zha-zhing, looted the city of Yua Tzhan and razed it to the ground. Very few of its citizens escaped alive. This has since become remembered as the Massacre of Yua Tzhan. Young Prince Kamada, Xo-lin’s great-great-grandson, died during the winter. He was next in line for the throne of Chai because General Zha-zhing was the illegitimate son of Xo-lin.</dd>
<dt>MS 5086 Bhanar and Chai</dt>
<dd>The Chai army occupied eastern Bhanar, and all of its steam-powered engines and weapons of war were systematically destroyed. The aged Khea-khan Xo-lin of Chai died, and his only remaining son, Zha-zhing, acceded to the throne. Zha-zhing’s political rivals accused him of plotting and orchestrating the young prince Kadama’s death in the preceding year for his personal gain. These accusations were never proven. Upon his inauguration he married Princess Myelsha of Mhytan. Chai forts along the border with Bhanar were attacked by Bhanarian irregulars in reprisal for the Massacre of Yua Tzhan. A treaty was signed between Chai and Mhytan (the Chai Sea Treaty). All Bhanarian shipping was denied access to the Chai Sea by Mhytanian and Chai men of war. The blockade soon suffocated Bhanarian resistance.</dd>
<dt>MS 5086 Shadaki and Free Alliance of Southern Magnamund</dt>
<dd>Zultan Zedoli seized the throne of Shadaki in a bloody uprising, and the state of Shadaki seceded from the Free Alliance of Southern Magnamund—the confederation of states which had emerged from the collapse of the Shadakine Empire of Shasarak the Wytch-king in MS 5057. Grey Star, the previous ruler of Shadaki, fled but he remained the Wizard Regent of the Free Alliance and set up his new capital in the Port of Suhn.</dd>
<dt>MS 5087 Bhanar and Chai</dt>
<dd>Bhanarian resistance collapsed. Khea-khan Zha-zhing installed Overseer Klutan upon the throne of Bhanar. Klutan was a political puppet of Chai. The Chai army withdrew from eastern Bhanar. Khea-khan Zha-zhing had a son, Lao Tin.</dd>
<dt>MS 5088 Vaduzhan, Bhanar, and Chai</dt>
<dd>Vaduzhan invaded south-western Bhanar. The capital city of Otavai fell to Vaduzian forces with little resistance. King Kardisa of Vaduzhan claimed the territories of former south-western Bhanar for his imperial throne. Chai chose not to oppose his claims. Overseer Klutan transferred his seat of power to the coastal city of Yua Klio near to the Chai border. Gradually he lost control over most of Bhanar.</dd>
<dt>MS 5088 The Isle of Lorn</dt>
<dd>The Shianti left the Isle of Lorn to reside with Goddess Ishir on the Plane of Light. Their final act upon Magnamund was to bequeath their island to the Order of the Kai. The handover was facilitated by their emissary, Grey Star.</dd>
<dt>MS 5089 The Isle of Lorn, Shadaki, and the Free Alliance</dt>
<dd>Lone Wolf travelled to the Isle of Lorn. Assisted by Grey Star and Guildmaster Banedon, he made plans for the construction of a second Kai Monastery. Zultan Zedoli of Shadaki declared their presence upon the Isle of Lorn ‘an act of war’. Shadaki mustered its army and attacked its southern neighbours: Korli and Forlu, members of the Free Alliance of Southern Magnamund. The Freelands sent troops to support the Free Alliance led by Grey Star, as did Lone Wolf. A cassel of Kai and three cassels of Sommlending marines fought in the War of the Sea of Winds. Shadaki was soundly defeated and forced to relinquish all of its territorial gains. Zultan Zedoli was assassinated before the year was out. Ulonga the Shaman, the evil necromancer who pulled the strings in Zedoli’s shadow, now overtly seized control of Shadaki with assistance from Sesketera, the notoriously cruel ruler of the city-state of Ghol-Tabras.</dd>
<dt>MS 5090 Lencia and Nyras</dt>
<dd>The Lencians were forced out of Nyras by Warmarshal Ranghor. King Sarnac III was killed. A civil war erupted in the Drakkarim nations as Ranghor and his former lieutenant, Ghangrim, wrestled for control.</dd>
<dt>MS 5090 The Isle of Lorn</dt>
<dd>Construction began on the new Kai Monastery on the Isle of Lorn. It would take ten years to complete. Most of the Grand Masters of the New Order helped in the building of this magnificent fortress.</dd>
<dt>MS 5090 Shadaki</dt>
<dd>Occasional border skirmishes between Shadaki and Korli persisted.</dd>
<dt>MS 5091 Siyen</dt>
<dd>A large number of Agarashi creatures (estimated at between 8,000–12,000) emerged from the Darkwall Mountains and invaded the Lucien Plain of Siyen. The city of Varedo was overrun and destroyed. The Siyenese army swiftly counter-attacked and forced the ravening horde back into its hidden mountain lairs.</dd>
<dt>MS 5091 The Isle of Lorn</dt>
<dd>The Freelands Alliance provided 1,000 workers to help with the construction of the Kai Monastery of Lorn. </dd>
<dt>MS 5091 Shadaki</dt>
<dd>All incursions by Shadaki into Korli ceased.</dd>
<dt>MS 5091 Sommerlund</dt>
<dd>King Ulnar V of Sommerlund and his two daughters, Crown Princess Imelda and Princess Madelon, died in unexplained circumstances in the King’s Keep of Holmgard. Kai Grand Master Firestone was killed attempting to protect them. The party responsible for these tragic murders was never found but the fact someone could strike in the heart of Sommerlund greatly worried Supreme Master Lone Wolf. King Tor IV, son of Crown Princess Imelda, acceded to the throne of Sommerlund.</dd>
<dt>MS 5092 Lunarlia</dt>
<dd>The town of Jaroc, in southern Lunarlia, was attacked and destroyed by a large force (estimated at between 7,000–10,000) of Agarashi from the Doomlands of Naaros.</dd>
<dt>MS 5092 Stornlands</dt>
<dd>The War of the Warrens erupted between Eldenora and Delden  following the assassination of Lord Vandyan of Eldenora.</dd>
<dt>MS 5093 Starn</dt>
<dd>Mt. Vost was besieged by a large horde of unnamed creatures (estimated at between 12,000–15,000) from out of the Kraknalorg Chasm. The Giants of Starn received military aid from Boden which broke the siege and sent the horde fleeing back into the chasm. The southern borderlands of Starn (namely the Shadow Grails and the Tsuzeloi Hills) have since been heavily patrolled by the rangers of Boden and Starn.</dd>
<dt>MS 5093 Stornlands</dt>
<dd>End of the War of the Warrens between Eldenora and Delden. Eldenora won the war, gaining territory and tribute from defeated King Loarn of Delden.</dd>
<dt>MS 5094 Kasland and Cincoria</dt>
<dd>Several skirmishes occurred between Kasland border patrols and creatures encroaching upon Kasland territory from out of the Kraknalorg Chasm. In northern Cincoria, several of its timberland settlements were destroyed by similar creatures from the chasm.</dd>
<dt>MS 5095 Vassagonia</dt>
<dd>Zakhan Jaraza acceded to the throne of Vassagonia. Peace treaties were signed between Vassagonia and the Lastlands. The new Zakhan formally renounced all Vassagonian territorial claims to Cloeasia in perpetuity.</dd>
<dt>MS 5095 Magador</dt>
<dd>President Kadharian was assassinated and control of Magador was seized by Marshall Luthos Vorgada, a senior Magadorian army officer.</dd>
<dt>MS 5095 Sommerlund</dt>
<dd>A record harvest was reported.</dd>
<dt>MS 5096 Magador and Ogia</dt>
<dd>Magador allied to Ogia and their joint armies attacked Talestria. Palmyrion supported Talestria with military assistance and they won a decisive joint victory over Magador and Ogia at the Second Battle of Luukos.</dd>
<dt>MS 5097 The Danarg and Talestria</dt>
<dd>The Talestrian border with the Danarg Swamp was violated. Dozens of incursions were reported of swamp creatures hunting well beyond their usual confines of the Danarg. The Talestrian Army was deployed to contain the encroachments.</dd>
<dt>MS 5098 Lencia, Nyras, and Nyvoz</dt>
<dd>In the Drakkarim Homelands, Warlord Ghangrim and his Nadziranim allies were pushed back into Nyvoz. Drakkar Warmarshal Ranghor oversaw the construction of ironclad warships at Zeegazad. King Telnac of Lencia ordered the construction of a shipyard at Newton on the River Doun. </dd>
<dt>MS 5098 Kasland</dt>
<dd>Archduke Chalamis of Kasland died in mysterious circumstances. He was succeeded by Archduchess Larena.</dd>
<dt>MS 5098 Sommerlund</dt>
<dd>Rich new gold seams were discovered in the south-eastern reaches of the Maaken Mines. The Sommlending Crown reaped huge rewards from this new-found gold. King Tor IV doubled the size of the regular Sommlending Army of the South, and increased the size of all the Sommlending fleets.</dd>
<dt>MS 5099 The Isle of Lorn</dt>
<dd>A Shadakine plot to destroy the Kai Monastery of Lorn was foiled by Lone Wolf and the New Order Kai. Kai Grand Master Bright Star sacrificed himself to save the new Monastery. </dd>
<dt>MS 5099 Stornlands</dt>
<dd>Acolytes of Vashna were sighted numerous times throughout the year, mostly in Delden, Eldenora, and Salony. </dd>
<dt>MS 5100 The Isle of Lorn</dt>
<dd>The Kai Monastery of Lorn was completed on the fifth day of the New Year. At the inaugural ceremony, the God Kai appeared to Supreme Master Lone Wolf. He gave his praises, his blessings, and a sombre warning that Magnamund would soon suffer assault by the forces of Naar.</dd>
<dt>MS 5100 Sommerlund</dt>
<dd>Lone Wolf returned to Sommerlund to prepare the Kai Order for a new dawn of darkness. He also sent Kai Master Red Bear and three Kai Aspirants to Talestria.</dd>
<dt>MS 5100 Kalte</dt>
<dd>All Sommlending and Durenese trading links with Ljuk were severed without warning by the Ice Barbarians. Sommlending traders had their cargoes seized before they were run out of the Kalte trading post. Two Northlands Trading Company ships were commandeered at anchor off the Ljuk Ice Shelf by Ice Barbarian war parties. Their cargoes were seized and the crews were brutally murdered. The Kalte barbarian warlord, Tvor’tana, united all of the disparate tribes of the northern wastes for the first time. With their unanimous consent, he claimed for himself the title ‘Grand Brumalmarc of the Icelands’.</dd>
<dt>MS 5100 Salony</dt>
<dd>The seceding town of Amory was besieged and captured by an army of mercenary companies led by Prince Darthon of Rhem. Duke Lortha, the evil Highborn of Amory, was brutally slain.</dd>
<dt>MS 5100 Lencia</dt>
<dd>King Telnac was warned by the Telchoi of an impending Agarashi uprising and he called off his crusade against the Drakkarim. The Drakkarim perceived this as a sign of weakness and launched a swift invasion of Lencia. After Vadera and Westhaven were razed to the ground and King Telnac was killed on the battlefield, Warmarshal Ranghor claimed the throne of Lencia. Prince Sarnac, heir to crown of Lencia, was able to flee from Helmstorm and went into exile. </dd>
<dt>MS 5100 The Darklands</dt>
<dd>The Lake of Blood surrounding the ruins of Helgedad self-extinguished.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Dessi</dt>
<dd>Shortly after the Feast of Fehmarn, the Chasm of Gorgoron was rocked by violent earthquakes. When finally the quakes subsided, swarms of Agarashi arose from the chasm and infiltrated the jungle realm of Dessi.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Kalte, Sommerlund, and Durenor</dt>
<dd>The newly declared ‘Grand Brumalmarc of the Icelands’, Tvor’tana, with Nadziranim aid, unlocked the Vagadyn Gate, a Shadow Gate located beneath the Ice Fortress of Ikaya and released the Ice Demons that had not managed to pass through  this ethereal corridor before it was sealed millennia ago. These powerful creatures of evil brought an early and unnatural winter to Sommerlund and Durenor. The Kaltersee froze over and the Ice Barbarians swept down and invaded northern Sommerlund and northern Durenor. Supreme Master Lone Wolf, King Tor IV of Sommerlund, and King Danan I of Durenor lead the armies that destroyed most of the Ice Demons, and then defeated the Ice Barbarians, sending them fleeing back to their frigid wilderness. The victory was won at the cost of the heroic self-sacrifice of King Tor IV. The unnatural winter ended as swiftly as it had begun. Sommerlund endured three months of flooding before all of the melt waters declined and the natural cycle of the seasons resumed once more. King Haigh V acceded to the throne of Sommerlund and married Princess Emyla of Talestria.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Lencia</dt>
<dd>Prince Sarnac, at the head of a united Freelands force, attacked Helmstorm and liberated it from the Drakkarim. Sarnac was crowned King Sarnac IV of Lencia before he led his forces from Helmstorm to face the Drakkarim who had rallied to the north of the capital. Lencian and Drakkarim armies fought at the Battle of Grimstone Valley. Ranghor was vanquished when troops from Kasland arrived to reinforce the Lencians late on the second day of the battle.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Eru</dt>
<dd>An Eruan Pathfinder reported that Ghangrim’s Nadziranim had constructed a machine that would ‘devastate the Freelands’.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Western Tentarias</dt>
<dd>The Invasion of Darke began. The city fell to the united forces of Eru, Lencia, Kasland, Boden, and Bor. King Sarnac IV renamed the city ‘Gamir’, its ancient Lencian title. Sarnac pressed on through Nyras and Nyvoz, intent on taking Kagorst and wiping out the remaining Drakkarim threat. Sarnac rode to victory and razed Kagorst.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Skaror</dt>
<dd>Frequent and violet earthquakes tore open the borderland between the Darklands and Skaror in the southern foothills of the Ogshezar Mountains. A deep chasm, two hundred miles long and of unknown depth, appeared and destroyed the ancient Darklord city of Cragmantle. It stretched from the ruins of Cragmantle on the Skaror border all the way to the abandoned Darklands city of Nadgazad.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Bhanar</dt>
<dd>The remote Bhanarian city of Bakhasa was seized by a Nadziranim sorcerer named Zashnor.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Maakengorge</dt>
<dd>The Maakengorge opened further, extending the vast chasm by twenty five miles to the east. The ruins of Maaken were completely levelled by the violent aftershocks, and very few buildings in the Free State of Casiorn were left standing.</dd>
<dt>MS 5101 Stornlands</dt>
<dd>Thousands of Acolytes of Vashna began to make pilgrimage to the Maakengorge.</dd>
<dt>MS 5102 Chai</dt>
<dd>Khea-khan Zha-zhing died (aged 58) on the Feast of Fehmarn. His son, Lao Tin (aged 16), became the new Khea-khan of Chai.</dd>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>It is early spring in the year MS 5102, and you are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai, the warrior élite of Sommerlund.</p>
<p>It is a clear moonlit night and you are staring out across the crystal clear waters of the Sea of Dreams from the high window of your chambers in the Kai Monastery of Lorn. The crunching sound of footfalls on loose gravel draws your attention to the parade ground below. A pair of diligent young Kai Warmarns, clad in black and yellow chequered tabards, is patrolling the perimeter with spears on their shoulders. Your eyes wander towards the centre of the parade ground, to a low circular wall of white Kirlundin stone. It encompasses two sturdy Sommlending Oaks. You are reminded of when these trees were transplanted here during the inauguration of the monastery, on the Feast of Fehmarn, two years previously. They were transported all the way from your homeland by sea. The oaks represent the two Sommlending Kai Monasteries with their roots inextricably entwined. The moon is full tonight. Ishir’s Blessing casts its ashen light upon the battlements, towers, and gleaming porticos of the new monastery. You take great pride in what you see, for the sweat of your own labour contributed to the construction of this magnificent fortress.</p>
<p>Your pride is tinged with apprehension, for you have much on your mind. Sommerlund suffered greatly during the perpetual winter and heavy thaw of last year. Fortunately, before his untimely death in MS 5101, King Tor IV had wisely made provision for the storage of food and fuel throughout Sommerlund, and these caches saved the lives of countless thousands of citizens. You are confident that your homeland will surely recover from the Long Winter of MS 5101, but it will likely take two years or more before life there returns to normal. However, this is the lesser of your present concerns. The greater is something less tangible. For the past two weeks, you have been haunted by a feeling that the forces of darkness are poised to unleash an assault upon Magnamund. You are not alone in your feelings. Blazer, one of your fellow Grand Masters, confided to you this evening that he, too, has been having similar feelings of foreboding for no apparent reason, as have several of the more psychically gifted Kai Masters in the monastery.</p>
<p>The events of tomorrow should allay or confirm your fears. Supreme Master Lone Wolf is expected to arrive by skyship from Dessi at noon. You and Grand Master Blazer will formally greet him when he disembarks upon the monastery parade ground. You have personally overseen the arrangements for the docking of his skyship, and an honour guard of Kai Masters has been drilled to perfection in readiness for his inspection. Satisfied that everything is prepared for tomorrow’s duty, you close your window and retire to your bed.</p>
<p>You awake at dawn and breakfast with a dozen Kai Masters in the mess hall. Then you make your final preparations for Lone Wolf’s return. As noon approaches, there is a buzz of anticipation on the parade ground as eagerly you await the imminent arrival of Supreme Master Lone Wolf’s skyship. Together with Blazer, your fellow Kai Grand Master, you make one last inspection to check that everything is ready. The lookout in the Tower of the Moon spots two skyships approaching, and he informs you of this by a telepathic message. Hastily, you issue orders to the Kai docking crew to prepare to receive this second, unexpected skycraft. A further area of the parade ground is cleared, and mooring points for the second craft are quickly installed and made ready.</p>
<p>The skyships make a slow and simultaneous decent towards the parade ground from out of the blue cloudless sky. They come to hover, side by side, no more than a few feet above the ground and their sorcerous engines are powered-down to a soft hum. Mooring lines are attached fore and aft of each vessel, and wheeled stairs are positioned against the gunwales of their main decks. The larger of the two skyships is Skyfort, Supreme Master Lone Wolf’s personal vessel, which he received as a gift from Guildmaster Banedon two years previously. Lone Wolf appears at the head of the stairs, and behind him you can see four Kai Grand Masters: Black Hawk, Star Lynx, Steel Hand, and Swift Sword, each dressed in their distinctive personal uniforms.</p>
<p>The smaller skyship is named Comet, one of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star’s new fleet of fast aerial vessels. Standing on its main deck, you recognise Lord Rimoah and Guildmaster Banedon. With them is a small humanoid creature with greenish skin and crimson eyes. It shuffles impatiently and tugs at the brim of its tall felt hat to shield its sensitive crimson eyes from the glare of the noon sun. Although you have never seen a creature like this before, you know enough about the myriad races of Magnamund to deduce that this is a Kloon Sage of Chaman.</p>
<p>Supreme Master Lone Wolf descends the stairs to the parade ground, and a fanfare of cornets is sounded when he first sets foot on the gravelled surface. He makes a swift inspection of the assembled ranks and commends the Kai Masters on their turnout. Then he dismisses them in order that they may return to their teaching duties. As they disperse and leave the parade ground, Lone Wolf calls you and Blazer forward and informs you both that a special conference will be held in his personal chambers in one hour’s time. You are both instructed to attend.</p>
<p>Supreme Master Lone Wolf’s chambers occupy the top two floors of the Tower of the Moon, the tallest of the monastery’s crenulated towers. The lower of these two floors contains the Grand Hall of the Supreme Master, and it is here that the special conference is convened. The hall is a magnificent exemplification of Sommlending architectural design. Its gold-veined pillars of marble support a buttressed ceiling embellished with a vibrant mural depicting famous events in Sommlending history. The walls are draped with the war banners of the Kai, and several glass-fronted display cabinets, set around the hall, contain trophies, medals, and mementoes collected by Lone Wolf during his many quests. You and Blazer pass through the hall’s great door which closes behind you and locks with a muffled click. Gathered in a circle around a large table set before the Supreme Master’s alabaster throne, you see the illustrious and dignified group who arrived at the monastery an hour ago. Lone Wolf beckons you and Blazer to join them. Spread upon the table’s polished surface is a detailed map of Magnamund.</p>
<p>‘Now that our company is complete, I call upon Lord Rimoah and Sage Chastan to give their report of the unprecedented events that have prompted me to convene this special meeting,’ says Lone Wolf.</p>
<p>‘Thank you, my Lord,’ responds Rimoah. He picks up a steel pointer from the table and uses it to aid his briefing. Tapping its tip upon his homeland of Dessi, he begins.</p>
<p>‘The High Council of the Elder Magi has become aware of several threats to the security of Magnamund that have demanded our urgent attention. Whereas, in the past, the agents of darkness have confined their attempts to corrupt sovereign nations in one or two specific regions, we are now convinced that an orchestrated effort is underway to overwhelm the goodly nations of Magnamund. Several sizeable and coordinated attacks have been launched simultaneously. We believe their express purpose is to overwhelm us before we are able to gather our allies and mount an effective counter-offensive. Here, in Dessi, from the depths of the chasm of Gorgoron, a vast horde of Agarashi has awoken. They have emerged from the chasm and spread throughout the central jungles of my homeland. Our magicians and our brave Vakeros are now locked in battle with this horde as I speak.’</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah moves the pointer across the map and taps several other places where sinister uprisings are taking place.</p>
<p>‘The Maakengorge, the Kraknalorg Chasm, the Dark Realm of Ruel, the ruins of Cragmantle, Ljuk, the Danarg, the city of Shadaki, and the Doomlands of Naaros: All of these places have now become mustering points for the forces of darkness.’</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah lifts his steely gaze from the map and looks to the slight figure of Sage Chastan.</p>
<p>‘Our learned allies in Chaman forewarned us late last year. I very much regret that the High Council did not heed their warnings sooner, and for that I owe our learned ally a sincere apology.’ The Kloon blinks his crimson eyes and accepts Rimoah’s apology with a gracious nod of his head.</p>
<p>‘Our fears have become real,’ he replies, in a softly rasping tone. ‘But there is still time enough to stem this tide of darkness, though precious little time it is.’</p>
<p>‘Precious little time, indeed,’ says Lone Wolf, solemnly. ‘If we are to prevent this resurgence of evil from overwhelming the Freelands of Magnamund, we must strike swiftly and effectively at the enemy’s main mustering points. By preventing the reinforcement of their hordes, we shall stem this flood before it converges and drowns us.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf casts his eyes upon each Kai Grand Master in turn as he continues speaking.</p>
<p>‘With the aid of my wise and learned councillors, I have prepared missions for each and every one of you.’ From the pocket of his golden battle tunic, Lone Wolf produces six furled parchments, each tied with a silk cord of a different colour. One by one, he hands them out to you and the five other Kai Grand Masters assembled here.</p>
<p>‘Unfurl your scroll, my lords. Read and memorise the contents,’ instructs Lone Wolf.</p>
<p>With a tingle of anticipation, you untie the scarlet cord and open your furled parchment. It contains the details of your mission, handwritten by Supreme Master Lone Wolf personally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Agarashi horde, numbering several thousands, has emerged from the Doomlands of Naaros. Our agents in Chai inform us that it is being commanded by a powerful Nadziranim sorcerer called Zashnor. The Bhanarian city of Bakhasa has become their mustering point and it is now completely under Zashnor’s control. Bhanarian forces, hungry to avenge the Massacre of Yua Tzhan, have been mobilised and are currently marching south-east towards the Chai border with Zashnor’s Agarashi horde. Khea-khan Zha-zhing, Chai’s renowned warrior king, passed away peacefully in his sleep some weeks ago, on the Feast of Fehmarn. The new ruler of Chai is Zha-zhing’s son, Lao Tin. He is sixteen years old. Although he commands the loyalty and respect of Chai’s military High Command, he does not yet possess the wisdom and martial experience of his famous father. Without Zha-zhing’s outstanding generalship, Chai is especially vulnerable to invasion at this time.</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, you defeated Autarch Sejanoz of Bhanar and secured the cursed artefact called the Claw of Naar. This powerful weapon was delivered to the Elder Magi in order that they should destroy it, to prevent it from ever falling into the hands of our enemies. Alas, despite every attempt to annihilate this foul object by all means at their disposal, its destruction has not been achieved. The Elder Magi have constructed a secure prison for the weapon in a secret location in Dessi until the means to destroy it is found. After years of careful study, and with the invaluable assistance of the Sages of Chaman, we now know a great deal more about this cursed artefact than we did when you first captured it. The Claw is powerful, but it is not complete. It is but one half of a weapon that is capable of unleashing a far more intense blast of destructive energy, with power enough to obliterate an entire city at a single stroke. The missing component of this weapon is a gem-like object called the Eye of Agarash. Without the Claw, the Eye of Agarash has no innate destructive powers. However, when it is married with the Claw, it greatly intensifies and concentrates the power of that weapon several hundredfold.</p>
<p>The Sages of Chaman have located the Eye of Agarash. For centuries, and without the knowledge of a succession of royal owners, it has been a gem that embellishes the Grand Throne of the Khea-khans. This throne is located in the Imperial Palace of Pensei, in Chai. Your mission is to journey to Pensei and retrieve the Eye of Agarash. Once you have it in your possession, you must return with it as quickly as you are able to the Kai Monastery of Lorn. Years ago, you saved the life of the young Khea-khan’s grandfather. For that, he will forever be in your debt. Our agents in Chai are confident that Lao Tin will willingly give you the Eye of Agarash and assist your swift return here to the monastery. However, now that Zashnor’s hordes are moving quickly to invade Chai, there is a serious risk that the city of Pensei may fall within a matter of days.</p>
<p>We are in no doubt that Zashnor is aware of the Eye’s location and its significance. It must be retrieved before it falls into his foul hands. We know that he possesses a personal weapon that bears a chilling similarity to the Claw of Naar. If, indeed, it has the same properties as the Claw you retrieved, then the consequences of him capturing the Eye of Agarash will be devastating. This outcome must be prevented at all costs.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When you and the other Grand Masters have finished reading and digesting the contents of your mission scrolls, Lone Wolf instructs you to furl them and place them in the centre of the map table. Guildmaster Banedon steps forward and sweeps his hands across the pile of scrolls. Immediately, they are consumed by a cold magical fire that destroys them utterly, leaving no trace. Lone Wolf calls an end to the conference and dismisses you and the other Grand Masters. Before you leave the Grand Hall, he instructs you all to gather at dawn on the parade ground in readiness for your departure from the monastery. With a formal salute, you acknowledge his order and leave the hall in single file. In silent contemplation, you each return to your quarters to make preparations for your individual missions. The afternoon is spent selecting your clothing and equipment for the mission and, after supper, you retire early in order to get plenty of rest before you set off tomorrow morning. With some difficulty, you eventually fall asleep after several hours spent in listless contemplation of your quest and the unknown dangers that lie ahead.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>) and physical stamina (<small>ENDURANCE</small>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 32). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21–28), you can carry your current scores of <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points over to this adventure.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you have completed the previous Lone Wolf New Order adventure, remember to choose an additional Grand Master discipline and add +1 to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and +2 to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>
<h3><a name="kainame">Your Kai Name</a></h3>

<p>It has long been the tradition of your élite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year’s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
<p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

<h4><a name="nodispln">New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines</a></h4>

<p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor—Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf—you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.  Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from God Kai many new skills and abilities, including the powers of Astrology, Herbmastery, Elementalism, and Bardsmanship. He perfected these with the help of his allies in Lyris, Bautar, and Dessi, and established them as new disciplines to be taught to the betterment of the New Order Kai.</p>
<p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="wpnmstry">Grand Weaponmastery</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which you begin the <cite>New Order</cite> series, means that you are skilled in the use of <em>one</em> of the weapons listed below.</p>
<p>For every adventure that you complete successfully in the <cite>New Order</cite> series while possessing the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery, you will gain proficiency with one additional weapon.</p>
<p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 points to any number you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.</p>
<h5><a name="anmlmstr">Animal Mastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.</p>
<h5><a name="deliver">Deliverance <em>(Advanced Curing)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, while in combat, their <small>ENDURANCE</small> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. This emergency ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
<h5><a name="assimila">Assimilance <em>(Advanced Invisibility)</em></a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of one to three days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques which make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.</p>
<h5><a name="hntmstry">Grand Huntmastery</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and they possess great natural speed and agility. They also have a superb sense of touch and taste. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p>
<h5><a name="pthmnshp">Grand Pathsmanship</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by hostile plants. They also have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.</p>
<h5><a name="kaisurge">Kai-surge</a></h5>

<p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, New Order Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> without loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (Kai-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously). New Order Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <small>ENDURANCE</small> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>
<h5><a name="kaiscrn">Kai-screen</a></h5>

<p>During psychic combat, New Order Grand Masters are able to construct mind-fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="nexus">Grand Nexus</a></h5>

<p>New Order Grand Masters are able to withstand contact with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="gnosis">Telegnosis <em>(Advanced Divination)</em></a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far fewer ill effects. Duration of the spirit-walk and the protection afforded to his inanimate body increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="magi">Magi-magic <em>(Old Kingdom Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of Old Kingdom battle-magic. These arcane skills include the use of basic Old Kingdom Spells, such as <i>Shield</i>, <i>Power Word</i>, and <i>Invisible Fist</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="alchemy">Kai-alchemy <em>(Brotherhood Magic)</em></a></h5>

<p>Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf and Guildmaster Banedon (the leader of Sommerlund’s Guild of Magicians), you have mastered the elementary spells of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells include <i>Lightning Hand</i>, <i>Levitation</i>, and <i>Mind Charm</i>. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Brotherhood magic increase.</p>
<h5><a name="astrolgy">Astrology</a></h5>

<p>The celestial bodies which occupy the skies above Magnamund have long been known to affect the lives of its inhabitants. Mastery of this Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to predict and shape the future by studying the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the myriad planets and stars. The number and accuracy of these predictions increase as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="herbmst">Herbmastery</a></h5>

<p>Mastery of this New Order Discipline enables a Grand Master to identify readily any substance derived from living or growing organic material. He is aware of any secret uses to which an organic material may be put, and he is skilled in effecting the release of a substance’s medicinal and/or magical properties.</p>
<h5><a name="element">Elementalism</a></h5>

<p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. By drawing upon individual elements that are available, or combinations thereof, he is able to detach, affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove, or accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, e.g. create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove air, or intensify fire. The versatility of this Discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>
<h5><a name="bardsman">Bardsmanship</a></h5>

<p>Through mastery of this Discipline a Kai Grand Master of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of legend, mimic speech or dialect, and stimulate a wide range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect and power of his bardic abilities will steadily increase as he advances through the Grand Master ranks.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 29 of the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series, you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in the next. For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original five Disciplines you begin with, you may add 1 point to your basic <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> score and 2 points to your basic <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original five Grand Master Disciplines, your Kai Weapon,<sup><a href="#discplnz-1-foot" name="discplnz-1">2</a></sup> and any other Special Items and Backpack Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>New Order</cite> adventure, which is called:</p>
<p><a href="../lw/30ditd.htm#title"><cite>Dead in the Deep</cite></a></p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>When you begin this adventure, you have in your possession a <a href="#map">map of the Khea-Khanate of Chai</a> which also depicts areas of the neighbouring territories of Bhanar and the Great Lissan Plain.Additionally, you possess a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed previous <cite>New Order</cite> adventures (Books 21–28), you may add this sum to the number of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" name="equipmnt-1">3</a></sup></p>

<h4><a name="kaiweapn">Kai Weapons</a></h4>

<p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the élite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>
<p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a href="#action">Special Items List</a>.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-2-foot" name="equipmnt-2">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe ‘Alema’.</p>
<p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you were to use ‘Alema’ in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of +7 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> would remain at +5.</p>

<h4><a name="howuse">How To Use and Carry Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct Weapon, it adds 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you find a Weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it. You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
<dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this Weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful Weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is advisable that you also equip yourself with a close combat Weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br /><br />
In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br /><br />
Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is 12.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai Weapon</dt>
<dd>Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal Weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This is in addition to the bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your five Disciplines, then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <small>ENDURANCE</small> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Chai is the Ren, though Gold Crowns are readily accepted. These coins are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns (or 500 Ren).<br /><br />
</dd>

<p>The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns (and Ren) </dt>
<dd><p>These are always carried in your Belt Pouch. It holds a maximum of 50 Gold Crowns. Coins of a different currency are generally smaller and lighter than Gold Crowns. They occupy less space in your Belt Pouch and therefore you can carry more of them. The national currency of Chai is the Ren. In some of the larger towns and cities of Chai, Gold Crowns are readily accepted alongside the local currency. However, this is less likely to be the case in rural areas of the country. Before you begin your adventure, you may exchange some of your Gold Crowns for Ren at the rate of 1 Gold Crown = 10 Ren. Use the following currency table to calculate the mixed currency capacity of your belt pouch:</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>1 Gold Crown = 4 Silver Lune</li>
<li>1 Gold Crown = 10 Kika</li>
<li>1 Gold Crown = 1 Noble</li>
<li>1 Gold Crown = 10 Ren</li>
<li>1 Gold Crown = 4 Sheasu Torq</li>
<li>1 Gold Crown = 2 Orla</li>
<li>1 Gold Crown = 1 Ain  </li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one Backpack Item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be kept during your adventure and recorded on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given initial capital letters (e.g. Gold Dagger, Magic Pendant) in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
You, Grand Master (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. You also possess the Kai Weapon ‘Ulnarias’, so you add an additional 5 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. This gives you a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 45.<br /><br />
You now subtract the Wild Dogs’ <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45−31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself—Grand Master.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>You (GM) lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
<li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Elementalism</dt>
<dd>By using this Discipline, Kai Grand Defenders are able to summon up a dense, misty vapour to obscure themselves from both normal vision and infravision (night sight).

</dd>
<dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Defenders who possess this Discipline are able to use their musical skills to pacify (and/or implant a suggestion into the mind of) an intelligent creature within audible range.

<dd>Sun Knights who have this Discipline are skilled in the art of chiromancy—the ability to tell fortunes from the skin creases and patterns found on the palms of hands.<br /><br />

</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Halt Missile</i>—This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2–3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight time in which to move away from the missile’s line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Strength</i>—By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration.

<h4><a name="sunlord">Sun Lord</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely.

</dd>
<dt>Herbmastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to cause living plants, e.g. grasses, bushes, flowers, weeds, rushes, to entwine themselves around the limbs of hostile creatures, thereby hampering their free movement.

</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.<br /><br />

</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast—a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a ‘0’ = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration—and degree of surface difficulty—increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-magic</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Lord are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Penetrate</i>—This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow, or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
<li><i>Energy Grasp</i>—This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i>. It differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or enemy to effect the spell.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to direct their musical abilities to disrupt the structure of inanimate breakable objects, e.g. glass, ceramics, urns, flasks, causing them to explode violently. Any person or creature in close proximity to the destroyed object risks injury from flying fragments.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="sunthane">Sun Thane</a></h4>

<p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Sun Thane, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Astrology</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are expert in the art of hypnotism.

The number of creatures so affected—and the duration of the effect—increases steadily as a Sun Thane advances in Kai rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes with this Discipline are able to command an animal to fall asleep at will. Some hostile animals may be able to resist this command; however most will be affected by it in some way.

</dd>
<dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Sun Thanes with this skill are able to protect themselves from the effects of being struck by natural electrical discharges, i.e. lightning.<br /><br />

</dd>
<dt>Elementalism</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to accelerate greatly the oxidation (rusting) of ferrous metals simply by touch alone. The longer the metallic item is touched by a Sun Thane, the more damaging will be the effect.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to alter the temperature of water by touch. By using this skill they are able to transform water into ice and vice versa. The volume of water affected and the duration of effect both increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to erect a special psychic defence called <i>Mindfort</i>. A <i>Mindfort</i> defence greatly reduces the effects of any psychic shock that would normally paralyse or weaken a lesser mortal.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Thane are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><i>Slow Fall</i>—By casting this spell, Kai Sun Thanes are able to slow their rate of free-falling to three feet per second, thereby avoiding damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. The duration of the spell is limited at first, but it steadily increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
<li><i>Breathe Water</i>—Using this spell, a Kai Sun Thane is able to breathe underwater for ten minutes. The duration of effect increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="grandthane">Grand Thane</a></h4>

<p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Grand Thane, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes are able to draw a weapon very swiftly, or switch between a hand weapon and a bow in the blink of eye.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>A Grand Thane can command an animal to halt and remain motionless. Few animals can resist this command. The effects of a Grand Thane’s command last approximately one minute and affect one animal.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance </dt>
<dd>Upon reaching the rank of Grand Thane, a Kai Grand Master who possesses Assimilance can cause himself, and/or a group of willing creatures in the nearby proximity, to take on the appearance of inanimate objects. Anyone affected in such a way must remain stationary for the illusion to work. Unwilling creatures are not affected by the use of this skill. A Grand Thane, or any group affected, can take on the convincing appearance of trees, rocks, bushes, boulders, etc. The effect will be negated immediately if the Grand Thane, or any of the affected creatures, should move or be attacked. The effect lasts for approximately 10 minutes and has a range radius of 30 feet.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-surge</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes can use Kai-surge to attack up to 10 enemies in psychic combat simultaneously.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-screen</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes are able to absorb and transform hostile psychic energy into a positive physical effect. Using this powerful ability, a Grand Thane can restore lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points while being subjected to psychic attack. The number and rate of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points regained in this way varies greatly, and is dependent upon the nature of the attack and the physical condition of the Grand Thane when the attack occurs.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
<dd>By uttering the Kai Word of Power (‘Kai!’), a Grand Thane can repel and cause damage to creatures who devoutly follow any of the lesser gods and champions of Naar—the King of the Darkness. The Kai Word of Power has no effect when used against non-sentient creatures or persons who have neither sworn fealty to Naar, nor acknowledged Naar as their master.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Telegnosis</dt>
<dd>Grand Thanes are able to excavate earth by force of their will alone. The amount of earth, the depth of the excavation, and the speed at which the excavation occurs all increase as a Grand Thane advances in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Magi-Magic </dt>
<dd>A Grand Thane is able to use the following Old Kingdom spells:<br /><br />
<ol>
<li><i>Speed</i>—By casting this spell upon themselves, or on another creature within 10 feet, a Grand Thane can triple the speed of all normal physical movement. It lasts for approximately 5 minutes. The duration of the spell increases as a Grand Thane advances in rank.</li>
<li><i>Power Strike</i>—Can be cast immediately before combat. It adds +1 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to the Grand Thane, and +1 to every <small>ENDURANCE</small> point lost by the enemy due to wounds caused by the Grand Thane. The spell ends immediately when combat is concluded.  It costs a Grand Thane -3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to use this spell.</li>
</ol><br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
<dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Grand Thane are able to use the following Brotherhood spells:<br /><br />
<ol>
<li><i>Illumination</i>—Creates a sphere of brilliant white light that will hover in mid-air within 10 feet of the Grand Thane. It can be directed at will and lasts for up to 1 hour. It can only be cast once per day.</li>
<li><i>Bridge</i>—Creates a solid bridge over an obstacle, or from ground level to a higher or lower location. The bridge appears as an opaque, milky-white stone. The range of this spell is approximately 20 feet, and its duration is precisely 1 minute. The range and the duration of effect increase as a Grand Thane advances in Kai rank.</li>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">New Order Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Grand Master, you are about to embark upon a difficult and vital mission. Seventeen years have passed since you banished Autarch Sejanoz and saved Khea-khan Xo-lin from a certain death at the hands of the Bhanarians. The land of Chai is now ruled by Xo-lin’s grandson, Lao Tin. You are fated to return to this distant land and retrieve the Eye of Agarash from the Khea-khan’s throne in the Imperial Palace of Pensei. You once saved his grandfather’s life; now the young Khea-khan is indebted to you, and he will willingly allow you to take possession of this accursed stone. As soon as it is in your possession, you must return with it at once to the Kai Monastery of Lorn.</p>
<p>During your mission you may encounter many hostile and wily adversaries. Your journey back from Pensei will be fraught with danger at every turn, so remain on your guard at all times.</p>
<p>Some of the material items that you find will be of use to you, but others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items during your mission, be selective in what you choose to keep. Pick your initial five Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores may be. Completion of previous Lone Wolf adventures (Books 1–28) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>
<p>May the Gods Kai and Ishir guide and protect you during your vital mission.</p>
<p>For Sommerlund and the Kai!</p>

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>You rise an hour before dawn. You have chosen to wear the simple clothing of a Chai countryman—a padded jacket of cinnamon-coloured cotton, apple green breeches, tan leather boots, and a hooded grey woollen cloak. You don your equipment and make a final check before you leave your chambers and hurry to the parade ground.</p>
<p>In the early predawn light, the area is alive with activity. The hum of the skyship engines makes the gravel surface of the parade ground vibrate beneath your feet as you approach the magnificent vessels. Lord Rimoah beckons you over to the boarding stairs of the <cite>Comet</cite>. He and Grand Master Blazer are awaiting you on main deck, and they both salute when you step aboard. They invite you to join them at the rail and watch the preparations that are underway on the deck of <cite>Skyfort</cite>, moored alongside. You watch Lone Wolf leading Black Hawk, Star Lynx, Steel Hand, and Swift Sword in single file up the boarding steps. When they are all on deck, they turn to wave you farewell. You and Blazer return their waves and bid them good luck and good hunting.</p>
<p><cite>Comet</cite> is the first to leave the parade ground. The powerful hum of its engine rises steadily in pitch as the skycraft makes its ascent. As it gains altitude, so you are afforded a spectacular view of the morning sunrise. It bathes the Kai Monastery with a vividly golden light. Once the skyship is safely clear of the monastery’s towers, Lord Rimoah sets a north-westerly course before handing over the helm to bo’sun Durin. With a smile, Lord Rimoah invites you and Blazer to join him in the skycraft’s comfortable cabin where breakfast awaits.</p>
<p>You enjoy a hearty meal together and discuss the details of your missions. The first part of your aerial voyage will take you to the small Chai coastal town of H’lau. This is where you will disembark and begin your overland journey incognito to the Chai capital, Pensei.</p>
<p>Enemy agents are known to be operating in Pensei and so it has been decided not to land you at the capital directly, for to do so would alert Zashnor to your presence and reveal your intentions. After dropping you off in H’lau, located on the Chai Sea, Lord Rimoah and Blazer will proceed to the Kraknalorg chasm where his mission awaits. You will each be picked up by <cite>Comet</cite> after you have completed your quests. Lord Rimoah gives each of you a large amber gem, the size of an orange. These are tracker-gems, kindly provided by Sage Chastan. He also gives you each a small leather satchel in which to keep it. (Record this Tracker-Gem as a Special Item on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. You keep it in its leather satchel which you wear slung over your right shoulder and around your body, so that the satchel rests on your left hip.) Rimoah tells you that the stones are beacons. They emit a power that he can detect at a great distance. By way of these beacons, he will be able to steer the <cite>Comet</cite> to your precise locations and retrieve you. Then he adds a few cautionary words:</p>
<p>‘Be sure you do not part company with your tracker-gem. Look after it and it will look after you.’</p>
<p>Rimoah tells you that the first part of the voyage, to your drop-off point at H’lau, will take six hours. You are expecting to arrive there at noon. A guide will be waiting for you at a clearing located a mile to the east of the coastal town. His name is Anseng. Lord Rimoah says that you could not wish for a better guide.</p>
<p>‘He was once an Imperial Chai Guard Captain, and now, in early retirement, he is one of a network of brave agents who provide us with reliable information about our enemies, most especially their troop strengths and dispositions. He will take you directly to Pensei for an audience with Khea-khan Lao Tin. You are to collect the Eye of Agarash and leave the city. Head south towards the coastal city of Dwala. I will return to Chai at dusk of the sixth day hence. So long as you still possess your tracker-gem, I will find you and bring you back to the monastery, safe and sure.’</p>
<p>You are reassured by Rimoah’s plan, yet you know that so much depends upon you retrieving the Eye of Agarash before Zashnor and his ravenous army reaches Pensei.</p>
<p>Three hours after leaving the Isle of Lorn, the <cite>Comet</cite> runs into heavy weather over the Mythenian Sea. Bo’sun Durin commands the crew to secure the decks for a rough passage. Once their duties are completed, they hurry below deck to the safety of their quarters. The bo’sun is expecting to be clear of the storm and back on course within the hour, yet the weather does not improve; it steadily worsens. The <cite>Comet</cite> is swallowed up in a seemingly endless expanse of roiling black thunder clouds. Tremendous winds buffet the hull and the skyship is shaken vigorously from bow to stern. Lord Rimoah draws upon his great powers to create a magical sphere of calmness that encapsulates the <cite>Comet</cite>. It keeps you safe from the lightning and the tremendous winds, but it cannot increase the speed of your passage and you are blown wildly off course.</p>
<p>It is close to midnight, twelve hours past your expected time of arrival, when finally the tiny lights of the coastal town of H’lau are first sighted in the sheeting rain. As <cite>Comet</cite> passes over the town, you see that it has been badly damaged by the storm. Many of the dwellings have lost their roofs and its colourful fleet of fishing boats lies smashed and scattered along the shoreline. On the outskirts of the battered town, Lord Rimoah orders bo’sun Durin to slow the skyship to a halt. Below its keel, you look down upon a clearing in the toa and Chai pine trees which is bisected by a muddy road. This area is illuminated sporadically by flashes of lightning. A solitary male figure stands in the middle of this grassy, storm-swept clearing. He is clad in a wide-brimmed peasant’s hat, a hooded rain cape, and he is holding aloft a Chai lantern which gives off a pale yellowy light.</p>
<p>‘There is Anseng,’ says Lord Rimoah, shouting to be heard above the noise of the fierce storm. ‘Reliable as always!’</p>
<p>A rope ladder is dropped over the side and you watch with trepidation as Anseng struggles to grab the end and hold it secure. When he has a firm grip on the foot of the rope ladder, Lord Rimoah motions you to begin your descent. As you clamber over the rail, he places his hand on your shoulder and says:</p>
<p>‘Good hunting, my lord. May Kai and Ishir be with you, always.’</p>
<p>You acknowledge Rimoah’s gracious words with a nod of your head and commence your difficult climb down to the clearing, one hundred feet below.</p>
<p>You are barely twenty feet from the ground when the <cite>Comet</cite> is hit simultaneously by two powerful bolts of lightning. The sphere of calmness that encapsulates the skyship is ripped open by the tremendous force of these dual lightning strikes, and the vessel is suddenly exposed to the full ferocity of the storm. As Lord Rimoah and bo’sun Durin attempt desperately to regain control of the skyship, you fight to hang on to the rope ladder as it bucks and twists wildly.</p>

<p>Suddenly you realise that you are not being subjected to an audio attack. The noise that fills your head is the effect of a powerful psychic assault on your senses. You call upon your Grand Master Discipline to suppress the unbearable noise and your swift response saves you from sustaining any permanent injury to your mind: lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Howling with frustration, the ghoulish figure leaps towards you brandishing his black staff and, in the blink of an eye, the staff transforms into a hissing serpent. It is disturbingly similar to the snake that emerged from the mouth of undead Anseng. You reach for your weapon and pull back as the serpent’s venomous fangs strike out for your throat.</p>

<p>You turn your mount about and shout to your companions to follow as your spur your horse to the gallop. Your mind is reeling as you race back along the puddled and pot-holed highway with Quang and the Watchers close behind. What are doomwolves doing here in Chai? These loathsome creatures rarely venture far from the Darklands of Northern Magnamund, the Nadulritzaga Mountains of Ghatan, and the Ogshezar Mountains of Northern Skaror. It is unheard of them ever being seen in Southern Magnamund. You come to the rapid and chilling conclusion that Zashnor must be responsible. Only the sorcery of the evil Nadziran could spawn these creatures so far from their native lands.</p>
<p>Your horse stumbles over a pothole and loses speed. Your companions flash past on both sides, leaving you trailing in the rear. Anxiously, you glance over your shoulder and are shocked to see how rapidly the doomwolves are gaining ground. The leading doomwolf draws alongside the left flank of your horse with its fearsome jaws agape. Your frightened mount veers to the right of the road and you struggle to keep him galloping in a straight line. Then two more of the loathsome doomwolves come racing up behind you on your right flank, growling and howling with murderous intent.</p>

<p>You enter the inn to find several patrons enjoying the libations and entertainments of this friendly establishment. The air is sweet with burning incense and the tap room is brightly lit and decorated with colourful flags and silk banners. Behind the lacquered counter there is a large portrait of Xo-lin, the late Khea-khan of Chai. The ornate frame is draped with two flags: the national flag of Chai and the town flag of Vabou. You follow Anseng to one end of the counter where the portly proprietor, Lun-chow, is polishing glasses with a piece of suede leather. He smiles broadly upon recognising your guide.</p>
<p>‘Later than I expected,’ he says, amiably, ‘but better late than never. Delayed by the weather no doubt.’</p>
<p>Anseng nods but says nothing about the deadly encounters you experienced during your difficult journey to Vabou. Lun-chow is an honest innkeeper and his association with Anseng goes back several decades, but he is also a notorious gossipmonger. If Anseng were to tell him of the Chagarashi attacks and your confrontation with the Spectral Entity, it would be all over town before dawn.</p>
<p>Your guide is sorely aware that you will need fresh horses to replace the mounts you lost on the way here. He advises you to avail yourself of the comforts of the inn while he negotiates the loan of horses with Lun-chow. He says it will likely take some time to strike a fair deal with the innkeeper.</p>
<p>Your rumbling stomach reminds you that you have not eaten since mid-afternoon. A barmaid is standing at the other end of the taproom counter, taking an order for food from one of the patrons. She scribbles his request on a parchment pad.</p>

<p>Instinctively, you leap across the counter and, in mid-air, strike the falling cask with the edge of your clenched fist.

<p>You follow the street and soon arrive at the city’s North Gate. It is here you find what you have been seeking: the Tower of Ishir. This grand and beautifully fluted tower stands next to the barbican of the north gate. It is embellished with icons and engravings and topped by a parapet with a large half-moon fashioned from silver-plated bronze set above it. This is the symbol of Goddess Ishir. It lifts your spirits and resolutely you stride across the rain-swept flagstones towards the tower’s arched portal.</p>

<p>Anseng nods in agreement with your decision. He is mindful of the many miles you have yet to cover before you reach Vabou. As you approach the covered wagon, you notice that it has shed one of its two rear wheels. The Chai wagoneer, clad in a hooded grey oilskin, is struggling to get the wheel back onto the axle but the thick mud and relentless rain confound his every attempt.</p>
<p>‘Wait, my Lord,’ says Anseng. ‘I know this man.’ Your guide tilts back his head and calls out to the luckless traveller: ‘Hail, Chengu!’</p>
<p>The wagoneer turns and peers at you both through the teeming rain.</p>
<p>‘Anseng? Is that you? Ishir be praised, it is you!’</p>
<p>‘Chengu, my dear friend, you picked a fine time to go to market!’</p>
<p>Anseng insists that you stop to help his friend and you feel compelled to agree. As he runs ahead, you bring your horse to a halt behind the wagon, dismount, and tether its reins to the tailboard. Anseng introduces you to his friend. You learn that Chengu is a rice farmer. He and Anseng have known each other since they were young boys. They were both born and raised in the same street in the city of Dwala. When they were young men they went their separate ways; Anseng enlisted in the Chai Army and Chengu became a farmer in this region. Anseng always made sure to visit Chengu at his farmstead when the army dispatched him to H’lau once a year.</p>
<p>The wagon is laden with sacks of rice and the weight of this cargo has made it impossible for Chengu to reattach the wheel. But with Anseng’s assistance, you are able to raise the rear of the wagon just enough for Chengu to push the wheel back into position. Its retaining pin has sheared off and so you improvise a replacement from an iron bracing scavenged from the tailgate. Within the hour, the wagon is good to continue its journey to Vabou. Anseng sits himself beside his friend, and you travel alongside the wagon on horseback. You have covered barely a mile when a cawing sound draws your gaze skyward. A trio of coal-black ravens are circling directly overhead.</p>

<p>With trepidation, you climb the wooden steps that ascend to the wheelhouse. Through the rear window you see a huge winged creature perched on the end of the stone pier. It is an Imperial Zlanbeast. Astride a grand saddle embellished with Darklord icons, you see a slender man-like figure swathed in a hooded grey robe. The raised hood of the robe hides the figure’s face but at once you know who this is: Nadziran Zashor! Klüz and Xaol have both been slain by your hand, and so Zashnor has now been forced to show itself and finish the task they failed to accomplish on its behalf.</p>
<p>In the Nadziran’s right hand is a short staff that bears an uncanny resemblance to the Claw of Naar. The head of the staff looks like a petrified vulture’s foot. It is cast in pure Kagonite embedded with specks of a shimmering scarlet mineral. Its shaft is twisted like a length of gnarled tree root and perforated with myriad pea-sized hollows. In a moment of sudden and terrible realisation, you know that this staff is not a replica of the Claw; it is the Claw!</p>
<p>Zashnor detects your presence in the wheelhouse and swiftly it points the Claw of Naar at the window. The Eye starts to vibrate and move in its satchel. It becomes rapidly colder and frost forms on the satchel’s leather surface. The movements become stronger and now you are being tugged steadily closer to the window. Zashnor has unleashed a spell that is drawing the Eye inexorably towards the Claw. If you allow the two evil artefacts to be reunited, the consequences will be disastrous. The only way you can prevent this calamity is to slay the vile Nadziran.</p>

<p>Quang takes the lead and you follow him in single file through the forest on a south-easterly course. You make steady progress until the stormy grey light of day surrenders to the approaching dark of night. You are all very hungry for you have not eaten a thing since you awoke early this morning. The storm has abated but the rain has become heavier during your long afternoon ride, and Quang is sorely aware of the need to find safe shelter, somewhere dry where you can eat, rest, and recover your flagging strength.</p>
<p>In the failing light, he spots a place that looks promising. It is a cave-like opening in the side of a wooded knoll. He calls you to come forward in the line and determine if it is safe to enter. You focus your Sixth Sense and at once you know that there is nothing hazardous lurking beyond the opening.</p>
<p>‘All clear,’ you tell him.</p>
<p>‘We’ll camp here for the night,’ says Quang, and he orders the Watchers to dismount and tether the horses to the trees close to the opening.</p>
<p>As they carry out his order, you and he inspect this natural shelter. Beyond the opening you discover a room-sized cavity that is suitable for your needs. Bai and Chao prepare a small fire and you help Quang and Deng to clear the ground and prepare a communal meal from the provisions you are carrying in your backpacks. If you have a Meal in your backpack you must now erase it and give it to Quang. If you do not have a Meal, you go and gather edible roots, fungi, and berries from the immediate vicinity.</p>

You have no doubts that Nadziran Zashnor is responsible for their presence here in Chai and it reveals to you that this evil sorcerer is a formidable adversary.

<p>Lieutenant Quang and the Watchers arrive on horseback soon after you slay the vicious Skarad leader. They complement you on your fighting prowess, but your Sixth Sense is now alerting you to a new danger. It warns you that the Skarada are not the only ones of their kind occupying the tree-line. Another two groups are now rushing towards this area, from the east and the south. Fearing that you could be surrounded by them when they converge, you inform the lieutenant of what you have detected.</p>
<p>‘We can’t go forward and we daren’t go any deeper into the forest,’ he says, thoughtfully. ‘We’d best take our chances out on the plain. We’re behind the Chagarashi roadblock now. If the highway is clear between the roadblock and Vabou, we’ll ride there directly.’</p>
<p>You agree with Quang’s plan and the Watchers agree that is the best course of action. Together, you turn your horses to the west and ride out from the tree-line, heading for the highway two miles beyond the open grassland.</p>

<p>You place one hand around the blacksmith’s ruined throat and the other on his chest. You draw upon your powers and transfer the healing warmth of your Kai Discipline into the dying man. His eyes flicker open and he mouths a warning with blood-flecked lips: ‘Beware the ghouls!’ His eyes glaze over and his agony comes to an abrupt end. He is dead.</p>
<p>You lay his head upon the blood drenched floor and lower his eyelids. Now your mind is flooded with unanswered questions. Why was he savagely murdered? What kind of beast is capable of such cold-bloodied slaughter? Where is Anseng? Is he still alive or has he, too, met a grisly end?</p>
<p>Galvanised into action by what has happened here, you race down the stairs and mount your horse. Quickly you bring her around to face the open doors and ride out into the pouring rain. The fresh tracks from the Blacksmithy lead you along the paved road until you reach the northern perimeter of the village. Here they leave the highway and veer due east towards the Nagah Forest. A narrow woodsman’s trail snakes its way through the Chai pines and the tracks can clearly be seen in its muddy surface. Your Sixth Sense screams a warning that this dense forest harbours an evil presence. You rein in your horse and scan the surrounding trees.

<p>You wake with a start and sit bolt upright. Your heart is pounding and your face is bathed in cold sweat. An unnatural chill pervades the room and it is emanating from the Eye of Agarash. The evil artefact was the cause of your traumatic nightmare and the residue of its awakened power now lingers in the chamber. The noise of explosions rings in your ears. At first you think it is a hangover from your nightmare until you see flashes of light at the window. The explosions are real.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, you put on your boots, backpack and cape and rush to the door. It opens as you approach it and you see Captain Jian Tzu running across the chapel towards you.</p>
<p>‘We’re under attack!’ he shouts, ‘They’re bombing the roof. You must leave at once!’</p>
<p>Jian Tzu turns on his heel and motions you to follow him. Chunks of masonry and plaster are falling from the chapel’s ceiling to smash on the pews and floor all around you. The Captain hurries to the altar and parts its silver cloth to reveal a trapdoor. He tugs it open and you follow him down an iron ladder bolted to the tower’s cellar wall. A secret passage leads to the cellar of a convent located opposite the North Gate. You leave this cellar by way of a flight of stone steps that ascend to the convent’s kitchen above. Jian Tzu unlocks and opens a door and you see the alleyway that runs alongside the convent. Fiery explosions and flashes of lightning illuminate the darkness of this narrow passage. You take a step from the doorway and look up into the storm-torn skies above. Amidst the roiling clouds are several large winged reptilians that are circling and diving on the roof of the Tower of Ishir. Shadowy riders cling to their backs. They hurl missiles at the tower roof before soaring away into the black clouds where they circle around before diving again. The explosive missiles that they cast down have already destroyed the icon of Ishir and much of the upper part of the tower, including the star chamber where you met with Jian Tzu, Herbwarden Zautro, and Lord Honos just a few hours ago.</p>
<p>You step back into the convent kitchen to keep from being seen by the winged creatures overhead. As you do so, the evil power of the Eye flares up and drains you of 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>

<p>Quang and the Watchers leave their locations and race to their horses. Rapidly, you mount your horse and spur him towards the open doors.

<p>Anseng insists that it is too dangerous to linger here any longer. The constant shuddering of the ground beneath your feet confirms this to be so. With his lantern held aloft, he begins the difficult trek through the toa and pine forest with you following close behind. Soon you emerge from the swaying trees and set off along a muddy forest road at a brisk pace, heading east. The sheeting rain and the constant thunder make it impossible for you to speak with your determined guide until you reach a small woodsman’s hut a few miles distant. Anseng points to the hut’s rickety door and you follow him inside, thankful to be out of the relentless downpour.</p>
<p>‘You did well to keep up with me, my Lord,’ he says, as he places his glowing lantern on the hut’s solitary table. ‘We’ll rest here for a few hours and leave at first light.’</p>
<p>From his leather backpack he produces some provisions: a loaf of bread, some strips of cured lamb meat, some dried fruits, and a small bottle of rice wine. Generously, he shares his meagre rations with you. While you are eating, you take the opportunity to observe your guide. He is a lean man in his early fifties, physically fit and impressively agile. He is dressed in simple peasant garb with a wide conical hat made from straw. Despite his mundane clothing, this man is clearly not a lowly peasant. He has the distinctive mien of a professional soldier, the legacy of years spent as a Captain in the Imperial Chai Guard: the warrior elite of the Chai army. A ‘<i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i>’, an ornate bladed polearm is slung over his shoulder on a thin strip of leather.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your answer is incorrect. The amounts are the same. After mixing in a quart of oil, the mixture would by ⅚ vinegar and ⅙ oil.

<p>You tether your horse to the consulate’s railings and climb the steps to the front door. It is unlocked. You enter and find yourself standing in a long hallway, hung with portraits of Durenese Kings and former Consuls to Chai. In a reception room immediately to your left you find a well-dressed old man who is throwing sheaves of paper onto a blazing log fire. You introduce yourself and his eyes widen when he hears that you are a Kai Grand Master. ‘My Lord, it’s an honour to meet you. I’m Grevan Helsar, an envoy in the staff of the Consul of Durenor. How may I assist you?’</p>
<p>You ask the aged envoy why so many citizens of Pensei are leaving the city. He explains that the Bhanarian army is amassing at the city’s west wall and they fear that an attack is imminent. He tells you that the consulate staff left Pensei four days ago when news arrived that Fort Jhung had fallen and the Chai Wall had been breached by the Bhanarians and the Agarashi. He volunteered to stay behind and destroy the consulate’s files and papers to prevent them falling into enemy hands. When you tell him that you are on a vital mission and that you are looking for the Imperial Palace to seek an audience with Khea-khan Lao Tin, he offers his assistance.</p>
<p>‘Of course I will help you all I can, my Lord. The way to the Imperial Palace is quite simple. If you continue along Tzushen Avenue you’ll come to the Zha-zhing Circle. The way to the palace is clearly signposted at this junction. But if you are to gain an audience with the Khea-khan, you will need to enter the palace itself. As you can imagine, the Imperial Guard are on high alert and it will not be easy to enter unless you have a pass. Now, this is something I am able to help you with.’</p>
<p>Envoy Helsar removes a thin rectangular piece of black lacquered toa wood from his pocket and hands it to you.</p>
<p>‘It’s my consulate pass. It permits me entry to the palace. However, I should tell you that I can’t guarantee that it’ll allow you to enter. In normal times it would, but these are far from being normal times.’</p>
<p>You thank the envoy and examine the wooden pass. It is engraved with the consulate emblem and inlaid with silver numerals that you are unable to decipher.

You walk towards him and look down at his face. It is relaxed and serene as if he is sleeping peacefully. You fall to your knees and slowly you move closer and closer until your face is almost touching his. Abruptly, his eyelids spring open and two jets of blue flame issue forth from the pupils of his glaring eyes, burning and melting and mutilating you.

(Remember to erase this Meal from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>As you finish your food, a ripple of applause among the patrons draws your attention to a curtained archway in the far wall. The curtain is draw aside and a troupe of entertainers files into the taproom, smiling with gratitude at the warm reception. They have performed for the patrons earlier this evening and now they return for their final performance of the night. From snippets of conversation you overhear, you learn that the entertainers are a band of travelling troubadours who come from the city of Durwan in Lissan. They are on their way back to their native city after having performed in several taverns and inns of Pensei. The musicians begin to play a lively tune and a trio of pretty dancing girls whirl and twirl around the taproom to the delight of the patrons. One of the girls is wearing a tight-fitting red silk dress, and she glances repeatedly in your direction as she gyrates around the room. It appears that she has taken a special interest in you.</p>
<p>When the performance comes to a close, the patrons give a loud cheer and the girls pass among them collecting donations of Ren from the appreciative audience. After the money has been gathered up, the troubadours thank the Chai for their generosity and leave the taproom by way of the curtained archway. A few minutes later, the girl in the red silk dress reappears. With a charming smile, she comes and sits opposite you at your table. She tells you her name is Rakhi and says she has never seen anyone quite like you before. She asks if you are a Northlander. Your senses detect that she is genuinely friendly and does not intend to do you any harm. You reply that you are indeed a Northlander, but you refrain from telling her exactly which realm of the Northlands you hail from. ‘I thought so,’ she beams, joyfully. ‘I have something that may be of interest to you.’</p>
<p>She places a velvet satchel on the table and flips it open. It contains four ceramic phials, each one stoppered with a cork and carefully labelled and priced. She invites you to inspect them and gives an assurance that they are all genuine potions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laumspur (will restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when swallowed after combat): 50 Ren / 5 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Tazheng (a powerful anti-venom): 60 Ren / 6 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Tincture of Sabito root (rare in this part of Magnamund, Sabito enables the human body to extract oxygen from water through the skin, thus permitting anyone who swallows it to ‘breathe’ underwater): 80 Ren / 8 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Karmo: 120 Ren (12 Gold Crowns). When taken before combat, this potion doubles your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score for the duration of the combat.

You are pleased to see that your scrap of paper is among them!<sup><a href="#sect41-1-foot" name="sect41-1">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Well done, you have answered the riddle correctly. It was 41 years ago that the mother (who is now 80 years old) was exactly three times the age of her daughter. The daughter was 13 years old and the mother was 39 years old.</p>
<p>You and only two other patrons solved the puzzle. You are happy to see that one of the other winners is Anseng. Yeng Zhi collects your winnings and places them on your table, together with your original bet in its paper wrap. You have won an amount equal to double your wager.

<p>You urge your horse to the gallop. Despite the difficulty he has forcing his way through the tall and sodden grasses, he quickens his pace just enough to keep you from falling into the merciless hands of the howling Skarada. Quang and the Watchers follow closely behind, whipping their mounts to extract every last ounce of strength and effort from them to escape the vengeful enemy.</p>
<p>You continue your desperate flight across the rain-soaked grassland until the howls of the Skarada can no longer be heard. As you ease your sweating horse to a gentle trot, Quang and the Watchers catch up with you and the lieutenant signals you to halt. You rein your horse to a stop and your companions draw their breathless horses in a circle around you. Quang pulls his mount alongside yours and together you assess your options.</p>
<p>‘We cannot go on in this direction, my Lord,’ he says. ‘This way will take us back towards Pensei. Despite the risks, we must turn back and continue south if we are to reach Vabou before nightfall.’</p>
<p>You know that the lieutenant is right. The further you go northwards, the greater you will distance yourself from Vabou and increase the likelihood that you will miss your rendezvous with Lord Rimoah in two days’ time. You are about to agree with him when a sudden wave of nausea and fatigue makes you swoon in the saddle. The Eye is exacting an energy drain and the increased strength of its insidious power catches you by surprise: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Quang grabs you and prevents you from falling off your horse. Anxiously he asks if you are strong enough to go on. ‘Yes… yes, I’m ready to go back,’ you answer, your voice a little shaky. ‘We… we must reach Vabou before dark.’</p>

<p>Halfway along Xo-lin Avenue is a small apothecary shop. Its front window is crowded with glass flasks, stoppered jars and conical shaped bottles filled with colourful potions, herbs and all manner of medicaments. Quang is fascinated by the window display and insists that you enter.</p>
<p>Inside you are greeted by the apothecary and his brother, the co-owners of this shop. With welcoming smiles they invite you to browse their wares. Quang purchases a flask of Senara Tea and he makes Deng drink it. The soothing liquid will help him to recover from his state of shock. While he is administering the tea to Deng, you inspect the shelves and take note of the following potions with which you are familiar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potion of Laumspur: 40 Ren (4 Gold Crowns). Restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> when swallowed after combat.</li>
<li>Potion of Alether: 50 Ren (5 Gold Crowns). Adds 2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the duration of one combat.</li>
<li>Potion of Malavan: 60 Ren (6 Gold Crowns). Increases the effect of Mindblast, Psi-surge and Kai-surge, by adding 2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the duration of one combat.</li>
<li>Tincture of Sabito Root: 100 Ren (10 Gold Crowns). Sabito Root is only to be found in the Boari Jungle of Valerion. It is rare in Chai. It enables the human body to extract oxygen from water through the skin, thus permitting anyone who swallows it to ‘breathe’ underwater.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may buy any of the four potions shown above for the price indicated. They are all Backpack Items that will each take up one space. You are under no obligation to make a purchase.</p>
<p>When Deng has finished the flask of Senara Tea, you bid thanks to the shop owners and leave. Soon you reach the end of Xo-lin Avenue and enter the quayside area. The churning waters of the estuary stretch out before you. Because of the heavy rain and failing light, you cannot see across the estuary to the opposite bank and have no way of judging how wide it is at this point. There is a ferry post close by and the ferry boat to Dwala is moored at the quay. You approach it, hoping that you are in time to catch the dusk crossing, but you find that access to this part of the quay has been chained off. A sign hanging from the chain says: <span class="signpost">Ferry cancelled due to weather</span>.</p>

<p>You have encountered these creatures before when first you visited Chai. They are Chagarashi. Long ago, during the Age of Eternal Night, this land was stalked by Agarashi—the hellish creations of Agarash the Damned. When Agarash was destroyed by the Elder Magi, his creations were scattered across the wilderness and plains of Chai. The creatures you now face are descendants of those ancient horrors. It is rare for Chagarashi to be found in this region of Chai. You sense that there is a sinister force present that has driven them from their burrows and caves in search of prey.</p>

<p>The moment you take the satchel from the Khea-khan’s hand, you feel a wave of nausea flow through your body that makes you shudder with revulsion. The bag contains the Eye of Agarash. For centuries this evil gem has lain dormant, its power inert. Now it has been awoken, triggered by the close proximity to you—a champion of God Kai. Hurriedly, you draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen to shield yourself from its malicious radiance. Your defences deaden its insidious effect, but you suffer a shock to your nervous system: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Whenever you are affected by the debilitating power of the Eye of Agarash, you may use Laumspur to help you recover. Normally, a healing potion of Laumspur restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when taken after combat. When using it to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> lost due to the power of the Eye of Agarash, you may only restore the actual number of points lost. For example, if you lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to the effects of the Eye (as is the case here), and then you take a potion of Laumspur which normally restores 4 points, you will only regain the lost 3 points. The extra point of <small>ENDURANCE</small> is not gained and should not be added to your <small>ENDURANCE</small> score.</p>

<p>A Kraan! Never have Kraan ventured this far south from the Darklands of Northern Magnamund before. You recall the doomwolves you encountered during your journey from Vabou to Valus and realise the only possible reasons for why they are now present in Chai. Nadziran Zashnor has either brought them here, or the foul sorcerer has established spawning pits somewhere in Southern Magnamund and is creating them to bolster the size of his invading army.</p>
<p>The shrieking Kraan banks away from the quayside and circles around to make another pass over the pier. You see two smaller creatures riding pillion in a saddle strapped to its scaly back. You magnify your vision and recognise that they are the same kind of creatures that attempted to block your escape along the alleyway beside the convent. Your Magnakai Discipline of Divination tells you that these hairless black leathery bipeds are Doomgah, a new breed of horrors created by Zashnor in its Spawning Pits located below the evil Bhanarian temple-city of Bakhasa. Your senses also reveal that Zashnor has been able to draw upon the souls of myriad victims sacrificed by Autarch Sejanoz during his long and bloody reign. They were imprisoned in the Bakhasian temples and used to supply raw power to its voracious spawning vats. The Doomgah are watching you intently through slitted eyes that emit a dull orange glow.</p>
<p>The Kraan flies away in the direction of the Main Square and then circles back, cawing loudly. It is directing a dozen Doomgah that are in Xo Street to race towards your location. They soon reach the end of the thoroughfare and come scurrying across the quay towards the entrance to the central pier. They are armed with black iron bows and serrated swords. When they reach the pier they draw their swords and give vent to a snickering battle cry.</p>

<p>When combat commenced, Zashnor sent a telepathic command to its Imperial Zlanbeast to assist it in the fight. The creature took off from the pier and commenced a flight over the raging estuary in a wide circle in order to best position itself to launch an attack on you from the rear. At the start of the seventh round, it comes swooping low along the deck behind you. It stabs at you with its sharp horny beak before the momentum of its attack carries it past and it soars away into the clouds.</p>
<p>In the seventh round, Zashnor’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> increases to 59. Its <small>ENDURANCE</small> points total increases by 5 points. The <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> increase lasts only for the seventh round and represents a temporary bonus that the Nadziran receives from the Imperial Zlanbeast’s attack. If you survive the seventh round, the Imperial Zlanbeast will no longer be a part of the combat in any further rounds.</p>
<p>At the start of the eighth round, you may deduct Zashnor’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> bonus. This will return its <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to 54. The increase of 5 points it gained to its <small>ENDURANCE</small> in the seventh round remains.</p>

<p>Howling with frustration that its psychic attack has helped and not harmed you, the ghoulish figure leaps towards you brandishing his black staff.

Upon reaching the top of the stairs you see an open trapdoor in the ceiling directly above. Your Sixth Sense screams a warning of danger, but you have barely a second to react before a hulking grey shape drops down and slams you to the floor. The scabrous hairless grey skin of this cadaverous horror reeks of a charnel smell. Foul black fluid drips from its fanged mouth and a baleful green glow radiates from its ragged eye sockets.

<p>Despite the rumbling thunder, howling winds, and heavy rain beating on the shingle roof of the hut, you soon drift off into a deep and dreamless sleep. Four hours later you are awoken by Anseng’s strong hand shaking your shoulder.</p>
<p>‘Wake up, my Lord. It’s time to go.’</p>
<p>The noise of the night storm has disappeared. The only sound you can hear outside is a dawn chorus of chittering bird song. You rise from your mattress and gather your weapons and equipment. When you are ready, Anseng takes you to a stable at the rear of the hut where two horses are saddled ready to ride. He prepared them while you were sleeping. Leaving the stable, you and Anseng set off along the muddy highway at a brisk pace. The rain and thunder have ceased, but the slowly brightening sky is heavy with thick grey clouds.</p>
<p>As you ride along, you stare out across the lush green paddy fields bordering the road. On your way you pass by several isolated huts and houses. Their owners, all rice growers, are repairing roofs and walls that been damaged by the storm and they pay you scant regards as you ride past their humble abodes. Anseng says that you must reach the village of Zang before nightfall. You have a long day’s ride ahead and there will be no time to stop and rest along the way. Unless you have a Meal in your Backpack, you lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. The need to stay in the saddle all day prevents you from foraging for food in the adjacent rice fields.</p>
<p>During your long journey, you converse with Anseng and find out more about your trusty guide. He hails from the city of Dwala, approximately 200 miles due east of your present location. He is one of a group of covert agents established by the Elder Magi for the purpose of gathering intelligence about vengeful Bhanarians, obsessed with avenging the Massacre of Yua Tzhan, who are operating in and around Pensei. They have also been tasked with finding out why Agarashi have recently been sighted far from their lairs in the Hyunsei Foothills, the Voxai Swamp and, the Huzang Forest. The last time they found the courage to do so was seventeen years ago, when they joined the army of Autarch Sejanoz for the invasion of Chai. Anseng tells you that his group of agents are headquartered at the Tower of Ishir in Dwala. Here they meet regularly with Lord Rimoah’s envoy and pass on all the information they have gathered about the enemy. Anseng is a proud member of this secret group of agents who call themselves ‘The Watchers’. While you are riding together, you notice an unusual polearm that is strapped to Anseng’s saddle.</p>

These loathsome creatures rarely venture far from the Darklands of Northern Magnamund, the Nadulritzaga Mountains of Ghatan, and the Ogshezar Mountains of Northern Skaror. It is unheard of them ever being seen in Southern Magnamund. You come to the rapid and chilling conclusion that Zashnor must be responsible. Only the sorcery of the evil Nadziran could spawn these creatures so far from their native lands.</p>

In less than a minute they are among the horses, racing alongside, snarling and snapping at their haunches. You see Lieutenant Quang unshoulder his <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i> and stab one in the throat as it attempts to leap up at his horse’s head. The sharp blade slices deep into its greasy black fur and the doomwolf tumbles head over tail, mortally wounded. Another doomwolf draws alongside your horse with its fearsome jaws agape.

<p>You utter the Kai Word of Power <i>Kai!</i> and the tremendous force of your advanced Discipline hits the grouped Nagah Ghouls and sends them reeling in all directions. Your decision to use your power has worked well, for these enemies were originally a cult who worshipped God Naar—King of the Darkness. They had a secret subterranean base in the Nagah Forest during the ancient times when Chai was a province of the Vaduzhan Empire. After their mortal deaths, they were interred in their lair and its entrance was sealed, but your Magnakai Discipline of Divination reveals to you that the power they gained from the Dark God through human sacrifices has kept them in a state of suspended undeath. Nadziran Zashnor who has, since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, become a champion of Naar, has most likely awoken these terrible creatures and is using them to further its sinister ambitions.</p>
<p>‘Charge!’ shouts Lieutenant Quang, and his stirring command galvanises the Watchers into action. Anxious to seize the advantage your Kai word of power has provided, all five of you attack the scattered and fallen Nagah Ghouls before they can get scramble back to their feet.</p>

<p>The journey to Jueng village is completed without any delays or unforeseen complications. The muddy highway makes the going easy, despite the worsening weather. Heavy cloud and torrential rain accompany you throughout on your long ride. You reach the outskirts of Jueng shortly before nightfall. Chao can hardly contain his joy when he sees the lantern lights of his home village aglow in the distance. He has been away from his family for more than a month.</p>
<p>Upon entering this pretty Chai settlement, Chao invites you all to come and stay at his house overnight. Lieutenant Quang thanks him for his generosity, but he is hesitant to accept his kind offer. He knows that Chao’s house is small and his family is large. He does not want to cause any inconvenience to his wife and five children. He proposes you all vote for your preference: stay with Chao and his family, or seek accommodation for the night at the village inn. Chao, of course, wants to stay at his family home. Bai, too, is in favour of this. But Quang and Deng prefer to stay at the inn. This leaves you to cast the deciding vote.</p>

<p>Chao has fallen from his saddle and he is lying face down in a large puddle. Quickly, you all dismount and hurry to drag him out of the water before he drowns. Deng rolls him over and slaps him twice but he does not respond.</p>
<p>‘He’s not breathing,’ he says, anxiously.</p>
<p>You place your hands on Chao’s throat and forehead and draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Curing to transmit healing warmth into his body.</p>
<p>‘My Lord, look!’ gasps Bai. He is pointing at the rain-drenched ground where Chao is lying. The surface water is turning red. You pull open Chao’s rain cape and you are shocked to see that the left side of his tunic is soaked with blood. You rip open the tunic and find a puncture wound in the side of his chest. It was made by the thrust of a stiletto bone dagger when he ran the Skarada gauntlet. Desperately, you try to seal the wound but it is too late to save Chao. He is dead.</p>
<p>The terrible realisation that Chao has passed away hits Bai and Deng like a sledgehammer. Their faces crumble and they begin to shiver and sob uncontrollably. Tears run freely down their cheeks as sorrow overwhelms them. Lieutenant Quang is also deeply affected by Chao’s death. He has fought many battles and lost more than his fair share of friends and comrades, but Chao was a brave and decent man, a loving husband and a good father whom he had come to respect and admire. He did not deserve to die like this.</p>
<p>You wrap Chao in his cape and raise the hood. Then you and Quang gently lift his body off the highway and lay it across the saddle of his horse. Quang secures him with rope while you try to console Bai and Deng. They are beside themselves with grief and cannot hear your comforting words. Nothing you can say will bring Chao back.</p>
<p>Quang pulls Deng to his feet and leads him by the hand to his horse. Then he does the same with Bai. You and Quang help the Watchers to mount up and all the while not a word is spoken. You gather up the reins of Chao’s horse and tie them to the back of your saddle and, in silence, you leave this miserable stretch of highway and push on towards Valus in the pouring rain.</p>
<p>You reach Valus late in the afternoon. There is a constant rumble of thunder and thick black clouds hang heavy above the Tkukoma Estuary. Frequent flashes of forked lightning are making the waters seethe and churn. Quang leads you through the arched west gate and along a wide paved avenue to a crenelated building located at the heart of this large and busy town. It is a Chai army headquarters and barracks. He shows his rank insignia to the sentries on guard at the gate to the cavalry stables and you are permitted to enter. It is good to be out of the rain at last. You dismount and the stable hands come forward to take your horses. One of them approaches Chao’s horse but Bai steps in his way and refuses to let him to touch his fallen comrade. He turns to Quang and begs him to be allowed to take Chao back to Jueng at first light. He feels it is his duty to be the one who delivers the sad news to Shen-Yin, and it is only right and proper that Chao should be buried in the village where he was born, raised and had lived for all his life. Quang takes Bai to one side and they talk for several minutes. When they return, Quang informs you and Deng that he has consented to Bai’s request. He will remain here in the stables with Chao’s body this night and ride back to Jueng tomorrow morning. Lieutenant Quang says that you must now leave and go in search of a way to reach Dwala, which is located on the east side of the Tkukoma Estuary. Before you go, you bid a sad farewell to Bai and say a silent prayer to God Kai to watch over Chao’s soul and keep it safe from the evil of Naar, King of the Darkness.</p>

<p>Despite their lack of training, the militiamen fight with great tenacity. They slash and cleave the bone-ridged heads of the Skarada the instant they appear above the parapet and none of the enemy makes it onto the walkway alive. As the first wave of attackers retreat from the base of the wall to lick their wounds and regroup, a messenger boy appears in the watchtower’s upper doorway. His face is flushed after having run several hundred yards as fast as he can.</p>
<p>‘Come quickly, my Lord,’ he gasps, ‘the East wall is breached!’</p>
<p>You hand back command of the militia company to the sergeant and hurry after the boy, following him down the watchtower steps and out onto the paved street beyond. When you reach the junction in the middle of the town, you see another messenger boy running towards you. Close behind him are Lieutenant Quang and the three Watchers.</p>
<p>‘East Wall?’ shouts Quang.</p>
<p>‘Yes!’ you shout back.</p>
<p>The messengers both turn and run along Nuoshi Street which leads directly to the East Watchtower. You and Lieutenant Quang are fearful that the enemy may have circled around the town and found the weakest point in its defences. But when you reach the East watchtower, the breach in the adjoining wall and the enemy threat do not appear to be so great. A ragged smouldering hole has been blown through the lower part of the palisade, and four Skarada have gained entry to the town by this way. The bodies of the five militiamen who were posted at the tower now lie crumpled and lifeless around the feet of these snarling furry beasts. The Skarada raise their bloodstained axes and slowly stalk towards you and your companions. Quang orders the Watchers to choose their enemy and engage them in close combat. As they advance to meet the Skarada head on, you see something climbing through the charred breach in the wall. At first glance it looks like one of the townsfolk; a man clad in simple peasant’s clothes and wearing a conical straw hat. But the moment he steps away from hole and straightens up, your throat tightens and your pulse races with shock and revulsion.</p>

<p>Deng looks down at the decapitated head of the Nagah Ghoul in shocked disbelief. He has heard of these evil undead but he has never before seen one with his own eyes. As he struggles to retain his breakfast and regain his composure, cautiously you enter an open doorway to your left. This is the tavern owner’s living and sleeping quarters, a large room that extends the length of the building. On the floor near the open window overlooking the street is Kenga. The old man has had his throat slashed and he is lying dead in a pool of blood. On the middle finger of his right hand you see a gold signet ring and immediately your Sixth Sense detects that this is no ordinary ring.</p>
<p>Kenga’s Ring endows it wearer with a limited protection from evil. If you wish to take this ring and wear it, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.

<p>Hurriedly, you recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell—<i>Slow Fall</i>—but the shock of the initial impact with the trees prevents you from completing it. The spell is only partially effective; you sustain a few cuts and bruises before you land, dazed and breathless, amidst a clump of thick foliage (lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). Fortunately, the lush vegetation and the slowed rate of descent have cushioned your impact, and you are able to rise to your feet with no bones broken. Your eyes are drawn to a glimmer of lantern light amidst the dense undergrowth and swaying trees. You shout out, hoping to draw Anseng’s attention, but the sound of the teeming rain, the howling winds, and the rolling thunder makes it impossible for you to be heard.</p>
<p>You force a way through the heavy foliage and emerge from the trees at the edge of the clearing, close by the muddy road. A flash of lightning illuminates the area for a few fleeting moments, yet in that brief instant you are seen by Anseng. You are also spotted by Lord Rimoah who is clinging with all his strength to the prow rail of the <cite>Comet</cite>, high above. He tosses a small object over the skyship’s gunwale and it ignites into an intense ball of green flame as it falls. It drops into the tangled grass of the clearing where it continues to burn fiercely. It is a signal flare, acknowledging that you have been seen. It also tells you that your mission must proceed as planned. As you hurry towards the sputtering flare, you see the keel of the skyship turn about and ascend rapidly into the roiling black clouds.</p>
<p>Anseng and his lantern emerge from the trees. Your worried guide pauses for a few moments to get his bearings, then he comes running towards you as fast as his waterlogged clothing will allow. You rush to meet him at the edge of the road. The noise of the storm has grown much louder since the <cite>Comet</cite> departed, and now the ground shudders alarmingly with every step you take. The sodden soil has become dangerously unstable. Lightning bolts strike the ground, causing fissures that tear open the soft friable earth. You watch with growing dread as parts of the clearing break away and tumble into these treacherous crevasses. A wide fissure opens beneath your feet and you lose your balance. Instantly, a strong hand grabs your forearm and pulls you away from the yawning rift.</p>
<p>‘Steady, my Lord,’ says Anseng, his rain-lashed face lit by the eerie yellow light of his storm lantern. ‘I’ll not see you buried before your mission has begun. Follow close on my heel, sire. Tread only where I tread.’ You nod in agreement and stay close behind your guide as skillfully he makes his way across the treacherous ground towards the tree-line on the eastern side of the clearing. Here the earth is more stable; the tangled roots of the tall trees are preventing it from breaking apart and collapsing. Sheltered from the pouring rain by the thick canopy of toa fronds, you pause to rest and recover from your dramatic return to Chai.</p>
<p>Upon checking your equipment, you are dismayed to find that the leather satchel containing your tracker gem is missing. The strap is still slung around your shoulder, but the satchel bag has been torn away during your fall through the trees. Your backpack has also been damaged in the fall, and three items are now missing. (Erase the Tracker Gem from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.

<p>You call upon your advanced Kai skill to regain control of the frightened wagon team. Inured against their primitive fears, they surge ahead and rapidly gather speed. You have covered less than a mile when you come to a sharp bend in the road and you are forced to rein in the horses to avoid tipping the wagon over on its side. Upon clearing the bend, your heart sinks when you see a strange phenomenon blocking the highway. Barely fifty yards ahead, a semi-circular dome of swirling dark energy crackles loudly as it brings the surface of the muddy road to the boil. Ghostly grey images swoop in and out of this dome, trailing wreathes of steam as they emerge from its unnatural blackness.</p>
<p>Anseng scrambles to the front of the wagon and can hardly believe what he sees. He opens his mouth to voice his shocked surprise but no sound emerges. His eyes widen with fear when he realises he can no longer speak.</p>

<p>You step back from the body of the dead doomwolf and stoop to pick up your Kai Weapon. As you return it to its scabbard, Quang and the Watchers come running to see if you are badly wounded. You nod your aching head and tell them that you are well enough to continue unaided. The remaining two doomwolves, having witnessed the deaths of their leader and the second strongest member of their pack, shuffle backwards to the far end of the fallen pine and lope away into the forest beyond with their tails between their legs. You feel sure that they will not be returning here in a hurry. As you watch them disappear into the trees, you feel a sudden wave of weakness wash through your body. It makes your stomach churn and leaves you gasping for breath. Once again, the Eye of Agarash has activated and this time it drains you of 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Wiping a trickle of cold sweat from your brow with the back of your trembling hand, you swallow hard and tell your companions that it is just the effect of the gash you have sustained to the back of your head. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Curing, you staunch the bleeding and repair your damaged flesh. Quang and the Watchers are impressed by the speed of your recovery and are reassured that you are indeed fit to go on. You mount your horses and leave the ravine without looking back.</p>

Drawing upon your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you focus on the smoking sphere and will it to rise up from the deck. Slowly it ascends. When it reaches chest height, you halt it in mid-air and concentrate a burst of mental energy that sends it flying over the gunwale of the ship. It hits the raging waters and explodes, showering you with foaming spray.</p>
<p>You are wiping the foam from your face with the back of your hand when your eye catches some movement on the quayside. The Doomgah are slowly and nervously returning to the stone pier. They are very wary but they are also very curious to discover if Xaol has been triumphant. You crouch low to avoid being spotted and shuffle your way towards the door of the wheelhouse. You resolve to get below deck and find a place to hide before the Doomgah muster enough courage to come along the pier and board the <cite>Silver Virixe</cite>. When they find the ruined remains of Xaol’s corpse, they will likely come searching for you.</p>
<p>Your basic Kai Discipline of Mind Over Matter deals quickly and easily with the padlock on the wheelhouse door. It snaps open and you slide back the door and enter. Swiftly, you tug the door closed behind you and use the padlock to secure it from the inside. A set of wooden steps lead down to the lower deck where you discover the crews’ quarters.

<p>‘This does not bode well for us, my Lord,’ says Anseng, washing Chagarashi blood from the blade of his polearm in a puddle of muddy rainwater. ‘I’ve never known these creatures to venture this far south before. Something has made them come here, something more than a hunger for horseflesh.’</p>
<p>Your Sixth Sense warns you of an evil presence in the surrounding trees, an evil that is supernatural in nature, but you decide not to inform Anseng of your feelings for it will only disturb your brave guide unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Once again you call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control to calm the wagon team. They are slow to respond to your soothing commands but your persistence pays off.

<p>Xo Street is lined with fishmongers’ and butchers’ shops and small workshops that make and sell hardware and travelling equipment. You pass their shuttered doors and arrive at the city’s quay. Thunder rumbles and the dark waters of the estuary roil and seethe, illuminated and tormented by jagged bolts of lightning. Scarlet flags are flying all along the quayside as a weather warning. It is forbidden to take a boat out when these flags are displayed. Most of the boats are securely moored and under canvas, save for a few foreign trading vessels that are berthed at a long stone pier. These are not under covers, but they are well secured with ropes and chains, their hatches battened down and their sails stowed away in lockers below deck.</p>

A bony ridge runs from their foreheads to the base of their stunted tails and each has a mouth filled with tiger-like fangs. They carry crude axes fashioned from flint and bone gripped tightly in their short-clawed hands.</p>

<p>It is shortly before midday when you come to a wooden bridge that carries the highway across a swollen stream. On the other side of the bridge is a farmstead surrounded by a split pine fence. Chao informs you that this farmstead belongs to his wife’s brother, Genzu. It comprises a farm house, a large barn, and several small outhouses and pig pens. It seems to be deserted and Chao says this is very odd. Genzu employs more than twenty farmhands and this place is usually very busy, even when the weather is bad.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Quang decides to take a closer look. He has a strong feeling that something is amiss. You ride through a gap in the fence and along a muddy track that leads directly to the farm house and barn. Chao calls out to Genzu but he gets no reply.</p>
<p>‘Maybe he’s in the barn,’ he says, and he trots his horse towards its open double doors. Quang tells Bai to go and see if anyone is inside the farm house. Bai dismounts and hands the reins of his horse to Deng before running across the muddy ground towards the farm house door.</p>
<p>‘No sense us standing out here in the rain,’ says Quang, and he motions you to follow him to the barn. Chao is searching the lower part of the barn when you ride in. You see that there is an expansive loft overhead that occupies the apex of the roof and is stacked with bales of straw. You dismount and join Chao to look for anything that could explain why the farm has been abandoned. Meanwhile, Quang and Deng climb the ladder that leads to the hay loft.</p>
<p>You are searching along the west side of the barn, close to the timber planked wall, when you catch something moving out of the corner of your eye. Through a gap in the planks, you see several figures approaching.

<p>Elder Qinlau sees to it that your horses are stabled here at Militia Headquarters. Meanwhile, Captain Xing writes two notes informing his militia sergeants that you and Lieutenant Quang are authorised to take command of their companies. Then he hurries away to the bell tower and rings the bell. It warns the townsfolk that Vabou is in imminent danger of attack and it calls the militia to their battle posts at the watchtowers and along the perimeter walls.</p>
<p>A small group of boys gather at the Militia headquarters. They are messengers who are charged with conveying written orders from Captain Xing to the militiamen. They will also carry reports back from the palisade wall to keep the Captain abreast of any changes in the situation. One of the boys is ordered to take you to the West Watchtower. Another is assigned to Lieutenant Quang and the Watchers who will go to the North Watchtower. As the boys are collecting the notes that Captain Xing has written, Quang and the Watchers bid you good luck and good hunting. You agree to meet back here after the battle, assuming the fight goes in your favour.</p>

You instruct him to show you the watchtower and adjoining walls so that you can best deploy his company of militiamen. With pride, he takes you into the tower and up a wooden staircase that leads to the parapet walkway. You order five militiamen to man the tower and deploy the others along the palisade wall. As they hurry to get in position, you see some of the enemy horde approaching the north wall through the sheeting rain. As they come closer, your heart sinks. These Skarada are being led by six Chagarashi. In unison, the snarling horrors throw back their heads and let loose a chorus of bloodcurdling shrieks; it is the signal to attack!</p>

<p>The graceful courtier leaves the hall and returns a few minutes later bearing a golden tray laden with refreshments. She pours tea from a silver pot into two porcelain cups and offers them to you and the Captain. Gratefully you accept her hospitality and sip the delicious beverage while you peruse the many fine portraits and paintings displayed in the hall. One canvas in particular catches your eye for you are one of three subjects portrayed in it.</p>
<p>The painting depicts the fall of Autarch Sejanoz. The setting is a darkened chamber heaped with rubble and earth. Light pours down through a ragged hole in the ceiling, illuminating the evil tyrant who is shown on his knees at the left of the composition. The magical Arrow of Atonement is embedded deep in his chest and, through the grill of his tiger helm, his eyes blaze with anger and agony. A small boy, young Prince Kamada, is shown in the foreground running towards the sanctuary of your outstretched arms. You are positioned on the right of the painting and you are pleased to see that you have been depicted with some fair degree of accuracy. The artist has captured your hair and facial features well, but he has exercised a degree of license by showing you clad in overly ornate Kai battle dress and not the plain blue padded tunic and breeches that you were wearing at the time. The Bow with which you fired the fateful Arrow into the Autarch’s heart lies discarded on the ground at your feet.</p>
<p>‘My compliments, Grand Master,’ says Captain Voushan, with deep respect. ‘The likeness is uncanny. You have barely aged at all since this painting was commissioned. If memory serves, I believe it was first hung in the throne room 17 years ago.’</p>
<p>‘You’re too kind,’ you reply with a smile, and say no more than this. You refrain from telling the Captain that you owe your preservation to your diligent exercise and development of your innate Grand Master Disciplines. Since you became a Kai Grand Master, your body has aged at a much slower rate than men less gifted than you. For every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
<p>A fanfare of trumpets sounds in the concourse, announcing Lin Tao’s return to the Pensei Pagoda. You return to the middle of the throne room and place your empty tea cup on the golden tray. As you straighten up, the young Khea-khan comes striding into chamber with his personal bodyguard, Lieutenant Quang, following close behind. He is clad in golden armour and is wearing his <i xml:lang="x-chaian">Hoguan</i>, his imperial crown.</p>
<p>‘Greetings, Grand Master,’ he says, with a youthful yet confident voice. ‘We are humbled to finally meet the Slayer of Sejanoz. We forever owe you a debt of gratitude for ridding us of the unholy Autarch.’ Lao Tin pauses to instruct his bodyguard to bring the Watchers to the throne room then he mounts his throne and motions to you and Captain Voushan to approach the marble plinth.</p>
<p>‘We have been informed of your reason for coming to Pensei. We are in accord with your desire to convey the Eye of Agarash to the Elder Magi, and we shall assist you as best we can.’ You are impressed by the candour of this young Khea-khan. He has the proud mien of his illustrious forbears and you sense that he will become an exceptional leader, given time and good fortune. Lao Tin removes a small leather satchel that hangs by a strap from his shoulder. He offers it to you and you lean forward with your hand outstretched to accept it.</p>

<p>You hear shrieks of pain and triumphant Chai battle cries. Captain Jian Tzu has rallied the City Guard and he is leading them personally in a merciless pursuit of the Doomgah. The last of these loathsome creatures have been flushed out of the streets and passageways of Dwala and hounded mercilessly towards the quay. Now the few remaining Doomgah are being pushed off the quay into the turbulent waters of the estuary. None of them can swim and they all perish swiftly in the deep dark waters.</p>
<p>‘For Chai!’ shout the victorious guardsmen, ‘For Khea-khan and Chai!’</p>
<p>Journeymage Honos and Herbwarden Zautro are with Captain Jian Tzu and they spot you standing on the deck of the <cite>Silver Virixe</cite>. They hurry along the walkway of the stone pier and come running down the gangplank, their faces beaming with joy that you are still alive. They embrace you warmly and commend your skill and bravery. The dramatic turn in the weather tells them that you have overcome a great evil this night and saved the city, and all of Chai, from a terrible fate at the hands of the merciless Zashnor. You inform them about the Claw of Naar and they can hardly believe their ears. But when you point to it lying on the deck a few yards away, all doubt is swiftly dispelled. Journeymage Honos removes his cape and carefully he wraps the accursed artefact, making sure that he does not touch the twisted shaft with his bare hands.</p>
<p>‘I will carry this back to City Guard headquarters,’ he says, solemnly. ‘I fear that if you were to convey it along with the Eye of Agarash, the consequences would prove fatal, my Lord.’</p>
<p>Your Sixth Sense tells you that Honos’s fears are well founded. The close proximity of the Eye and the Claw would create a surge of evil energy that would kill you in an instant. You follow a safe distance behind Honos and Zautro as you return along the pier to the quayside. Captain Jian Tzu is overjoyed to see that you are alive. He salutes you and shakes you warmly by the hand.</p>
<p>‘My eternal thanks, Grand Master,’ he says. ‘Once again you have saved Chai from a great and terrible evil. You will forever be revered as a hero in our land!’</p>
<p>You are escorted by the Captain and his men along Xo Street to the Main Square where the headquarters of the City Guard is located. Awoken by the fighting and the ferocious lightning storm, many of the citizens are now gathered in groups in the square, chattering excitedly. They cheer and wave as you pass and the Captain and his men acknowledge their applause with proud smiles and salutes. When you reach the headquarters building you ask what has become of the Tower of Ishir.</p>
<p>‘It has gone,’ replies Jian Tzu, sadly. ‘It fell in flames an hour ago. I regret to inform you that there are no survivors.’</p>
<p>The Captain makes his personal quarters available to you. Before he leaves he tells you to get some rest and he confirms that Lord Rimoah will be arriving aboard <cite>Comet</cite> as planned, at noon.</p>
<p>‘I will escort you to the North Gate shortly before midday and see you safely aboard,’ he says, and then he bids you good night and closes the door to his chambers. The physical and mental strain of your battle with Zashnor and its foul cohorts wells up and overwhelms you with fatigue. You climb onto the Captain’s bed and fall immediately into a deep and dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>You are awoken mid-morning by Journeymage Honos and Herbwarden Zautro. They bring you a hearty breakfast and together you eat and talk before Captain Jian Tzu enters to inform you that it is time to leave. You ride from the headquarters building to the North Gate in the company of the Captain, Lord Honos, and Herbwarden Zautro. The young journeymage carries the Claw of Naar still wrapped securely in his cape. Upon arriving at the gate, you see that it is open. Nearby, the smouldering remains of the Tower of Ishir remind you of the selfless sacrifices that were made during your long and difficult mission. You offer up a silent prayer to Goddess Ishir to cherish and preserve the souls of those who willingly gave their lives so that you might succeed. They have gone, but they will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>While you slept, the dawn of the day brought with it a dramatic change in the weather. The skies have cleared and warm sunshine is drying the saturated streets of Dwala. Lord Rimoah arrives precisely at noon. <cite>Comet</cite> appears in a cloudless sky and gradually it descends until it comes to hover just a few feet above an area of cleared ground outside the North Gate. You hear its engine powering down to a soft hum and see Lord Rimoah and Blazer awaiting you at the rail of the stern deck. They both salute you with pride. The boarding ladder is lowered and you say farewell to Captain Jian Tzu and Herbwarden Zautro before you climb aboard. Journeymage Honos has been instructed to return to Dessi by Lord Rimoah. He has been charged with the safekeeping of the Claw of Naar until <cite>Comet</cite> arrives at the High Council in Elzian, the Dessian capital. Rimoah and Blazer greet and commend you on completing your mission successfully. Bo’sun Durin takes Honos to his quarters in the bow while you retire to Lord Rimoah’s comfortable cabin at the stern. On approaching the cabin door, you turn and take one last look at the city of Dwala and wave a final farewell to Jian Tzu and Zautro as <cite>Comet</cite> ascends smoothly into the clear blue sky.</p>

<p>You soon reach the highway, but on arriving here you are disappointed to see a large group of Chagarashi have occupied the paved road less than half a mile to the south. Their presence prevents you from following the highway directly to Vabou. You are soon spotted out in the open and you see a party of twenty Chagarashi leave the main group and come loping along the paved road. You dare not stay here and you dare not go back to the tree-line. Quang’s military training kicks in and he seizes the initiative. He orders you all to push on westwards and seek cover in the hills. It is a sound tactical decision.</p>
<p>The grass and mixed foliage is taller and denser on the west side of the highway than it is on the east side. Gradually it slows the horses down, reducing their pace to little more than a trot. As they push on, it is as if they are wading through a thick green sea that swirls around your knees. At length you reach a gentle rise that ascends towards the brow of a wide hill. It is here that your Sixth Sense alerts you to danger ahead. Immediately, you shout a warning to Quang and he signals to the Watchers to halt.</p>
<p>‘What is it, my Lord?’ he says, anxiously.</p>
<p>‘I can sense something hostile on the far side of this hill,’ you reply. ‘I fear it could be an ambush.’</p>
<p>Respectful of your Kai intuition, Quang tells everyone to dismount and draw weapons. He orders Chao to remain here and hold the horses while the rest of you go to the top of the hill under cover of the tall grass in order to determine what lies beyond. Crouching low, cautiously the four of you make your way to the crest of the hill. When you see the terrible scene that lies in the shallow valley beyond, a cold shiver runs the length of your spine.</p>

<p>Your hastily-aimed Arrow arcs towards the Doomgah and strikes the middle of its iron bow, severing two of the fingers on its left hand and sending the bow spinning away. It shrieks with pain and frustration and hurriedly unsheathes its serrated sword. You run to the other side of the wheelhouse and peer around its side to see the Doomgah scurrying along the walkway, slashing at the rain with its black blade in a berserk frenzy. You shoulder your Bow and draw your Kai Weapon as it comes racing down the gangplank, shrieking maniacally. It does not know precisely where you are and you seize this vital advantage. The moment it reaches the stern deck, you spring out from behind the wheelhouse and launch a swift attack.</p>

<p>Shou Len removes something from his tunic pocket and holds it aloft for all to see. It is a playing piece from a samor set, an exquisitely carved queen made of ivory and inlaid with gold.</p>

<p>It is still dark when Quang wakes you up. The glowing embers of the campfire illuminate the interior of the shelter with a dull amber light by which you and the Watchers are able to gather your equipment and make ready to leave.</p>
<p>Bai and Chao venture outside and go forage for some edible foliage with which to feed the horses. There are plentiful puddles of rainwater and Quang makes sure the horses drink their fill before Bai and Chao return. Dawn has broken by the time the horses have finished feeding and you mount up and begin your woodland journey to the village of Jueng.</p>
<p>It is mid-morning when you happen upon an old hunting track. It is mostly overgrown with foliage, but it provides you with a south-easterly route through the forest which is easy to follow. The rain stops and your woodland ride is blessedly uneventful. The forest is rich with berries, nuts, and edible flora that are sufficient to sustain you and your companions throughout the day. Shortly before dusk you come to a wide and muddy highway. Bai and Chao recognize this road at once for it connects the town of Klatii with the village of Jueng. They have travelled this highway many times in their youth. Bai, who was born and raised in Klatii, remembers that there was an old woodsman’s hut near here, just a mile or two to the south in the direction of Jueng. He leads you to it and you spend the night here before setting off to Jueng at first light.</p>

It does not take you long to realise that there are no secure hiding places in this hold that will keep you safe from an enemy search party. Reluctantly, you leave the hold and retrace your steps to the stairs that lead to the wheelhouse on the deck above.</p>

<p>The Khea-khan’s bodyguard, Lieutenant Quang, enters the throne room accompanied by three men. Like you, they are dressed in normal Chai peasant attire. They address Lao Tin with the formal acknowledgement ‘Your Highness’ and bow their heads in respect.</p>
<p>‘Please, gentlemen, introduce yourselves to our famous guest,’ says Lao Tin, motioning them towards you with a sweep of his hand.</p>
<p>In turn, the men step forward and identify themselves. The first to speak is the eldest of the three. His name is Bai and he comes from the town of Klatii. The second man is Chao, from the village of Jueng. And the third is Deng, from the port of Valus. Like Anseng, they are all native Chai and have been Watchers for the Elder Magi for more than a decade. Bai is also an agent for Lao Tin and has provided him with reliable information about Bhanar that has earned him the Khea-khan’s trust. You hear that he was in Dwala three days ago when the Elder Magi instructed him to go to Pensei ahead of your arrival here. He brought Chao and Deng with him. It is he who persuaded the Khea-khan to remove the Eye of Agarash from his throne and prepare it for your collection.</p>
<p>Lao Tin informs Lieutenant Quang that he is to accompany you when you leave Pensei. He is to ensure you are not delayed on your ride to Dwala. You tell the Khea-khan that your plans have changed since you lost the tracking stone upon arriving in Chai. Now you need to return to the place where you landed so that Lord Rimoah can pick you up from there when he returns aboard <cite>Comet</cite>.</p>
<p>‘So be it,’ replies Lao Tin. ‘Lieutenant Quang, see to it that they have everything they need for the journey. You shall leave at first light.’</p>
<p>You bid thanks and farewell to the Khea-khan and Captain Voushan, and then follow Lieutenant Quang out of the throne room to the concourse on the floor below. Quang informs you all that rooms have been put at your disposal where you can rest before you leave the Imperial Palace tomorrow morning. Before you retire, he invites you to accompany him to the Imperial Armoury where you will be free to choose any weapons and equipment you wish for the long ride ahead.</p>

<p>You push open the front door and immediately you are struck by the sweet aroma of Lissanian tobacco smoke that clouds the air of the inn’s spacious, high-ceilinged taproom. There are more patrons here than you were expecting to find at this hour. Quang wends his way through them and you follow him in single file to the rear of the crowded taproom. Fortunately, you find a table where three men are preparing to leave. You take their seats, remove your backpacks, and stow them between your feet where you can keep a watchful eye on them. A serving girl emerges from the crowd and asks you what you would like to order. Quang requests three ales and food enough for all of you. She nods politely and disappears back into the throng of chattering customers. While you are waiting for her to return, you listen to snippets of conversations and learn that some of the patrons have been here for three days. They are waiting for the storms to abate and the ferry service to Dwala to resume its normal service.</p>
<p>At length, the girl returns with three pewter tankards of ale and a large plate heaped with cuts of cold meat and peeled vegetables. Quang pays her and she gives him three small parchment envelopes, six slips of yellow paper and a stick of sharpened charcoal. While you are enjoying your meal, a gong is stuck three times and a hush descends upon the taproom. The innkeeper climbs onto the counter and addresses his patrons in a loud voice:</p>
<p>‘My dear ladies and gentlemen. I am proud to introduce to you one of Chai’s most celebrated riddlers. Please welcome the wonderful, the amazing, the confusing and confounding Madam Dai-zia!’</p>
<p>The patrons applaud and an elderly woman, swathed in a flamboyant robe of turquoise and gold silk, is lifted onto the counter by the innkeeper’s twin sons. The innkeeper hands her a large hourglass which carefully she sets down on the counter beside her feet, then she smiles and bows graciously to the appreciative crowd. As the applause fades, she addresses them in a warm maternal tone.</p>
<p>‘Thank you, thank you, most kind. This evening I have prepared for you a special riddle. Please listen carefully and then wager generously.’ There is a soft ripple of laughter among the patrons before Madam Dai-zia clears her throat and begins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Long, long ago, there lived a beautiful princess who yearned for a handsome and intelligent husband. She had many suitors. Some were handsome, some were intelligent, but woefully few were both these things. She was herself very intelligent indeed. And so she devised this riddle to test the mental mettle of the men who so desired to win her affections and take her for their bride.</p>
<p>She had three toa wood boxes which were identical in size. Each one was painted a different colour and each one had a different inscription on the lid. Into one of these boxes she placed a wedding ring. To every suitor who presented himself she posed the same question. Based solely on the inscriptions, she asked them to choose in which box the wedding ring was hidden.</p>
<p>She told them that at least one of the inscriptions was true and at least one of the inscriptions was false.</p>
<p>The inscription on the Gold Box read: ‘The ring is not in the Silver Box’.</p>
<p>The inscription on the Silver Box read: ‘The ring is not in this Box’.</p>
<p>The inscription on the Bronze Box read: ‘The ring is in this Box’.</p>
<p>Please consider your answer carefully. The innkeeper and his sons will come and collect your wagers in three minutes’ time.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The moment Madam Dai-zia finishes her last sentence, the innkeeper turns the hourglass and the sand begins to flow.</p>
<p>The innkeeper will double any money that is wagered by those who solve this riddle. Your answer must be written on one of the two yellow paper slips and placed in the parchment envelope along with your wager. On the face of the envelope you must inscribe a symbol. On the second slip of paper you must inscribe the same symbol that you made on the face of the envelope. This second slip must be kept safely. If your answer is correct you will have to show this slip. If the symbol does not match any of the winning envelopes then you cannot lay claim to your winnings.</p>
<p>Now you must decide how much you wish to wager on this riddle. If you do not have any Gold Crowns, Lieutenant Quang will lend you 30 Ren (3 Gold Crowns) which you must use to make a wager. You cannot refuse to bet on the answer to this riddle. Everyone in the taproom is obliged to make a bet.</p>
<p>Deduct from your Belt Pouch the number of Gold Crowns you wish to wager. Make a note of this deduction in the margin of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you deduce the answer correctly you may add double this number of Gold Crowns to the money in your Belt Pouch. If you do not answer correctly, you will lose the Gold Crowns you wager.</p>

Abruptly, his eyelids spring open and two bubbling jets of living green flame issue forth from the pupils of his glaring eyes. They burn and melt and mutilate you.

Clutching at its sundered breast plate, it tumbles off the stone pier and plummets head first into the heaving waters of the Tkukoma Estuary.

<p>The taproom is almost empty, save for a couple of aged villagers who are playing samor at a table near the tavern’s crackling wood fire. They smile cordially and bid you good day. One of them calls out ‘Kenga, you’ve got a customer,’ and a wiry old man in an apron appears from a doorway behind the counter.</p>
<p>‘How may I serve you, sir?’ he says, benignly.</p>
<p>You cast your eye along his shelves that are filled with bottles and small casks of wine, spirits, and exotic liqueurs. There are a myriad to choose from and they come from all over Magnamund. On one of the middle shelves you see a tall dark-green bottle that you recognise immediately; it is Moyturan Brandy from Sommerlund. A sudden wave of homesickness makes you swallow hard.</p>
<p>‘I’ll have a glass of that one please,’ you say, and the tavern keeper smiles.</p>
<p>‘Ah, I see you are a man of impeccable taste, good sir. A fine spirit from a fine land.’</p>
<p>Kenga takes the bottle down from the shelf and sets it on the counter. He produces a bulb-shaped glass and tugs the cork from the bottle. When he upends it, only a few drops of brandy emerge, barely enough to moisten the bottom of the glass.</p>
<p>‘Forgive me,’ he says, now embarrassed and a little flustered. ‘I have another on the top shelf. Please allow me to fetch it down for you. It’ll take but a moment or two.’</p>
<p>The old tavern keeper retrieves a short ladder from under the counter and sets it against the shelves. Hastily, he climbs up and stretches for the spare bottle. Unfortunately, in his haste he overreaches, loses his balance, and comes crashing down to land with a muffled thud behind the counter. His failed attempt to retrieve the spare bottle has moved a cask that was resting alongside. It falls off the shelf and comes hurtling down towards the old man’s skull.

<p>The Skarada are less than thirty feet away when Lieutenant Quang shouts ‘Fire!’ As one, you release your straining bowstrings and send a volley of Arrows whistling into the advancing enemy. The missiles all hit their mark and three of the four Skarada tumble forwards, mortally wounded. Your Arrow penetrates the left shoulder of the leading Skarad and spins it around, but it does not make it lose its footing. Bellowing with pain, the creature hacks the protruding shaft in two with one blow of its flint axe. It snarls with anger and glares at you with its bloodshot amber eyes before it beats a hasty retreat into the trees.</p>
<p>You are determined not to let it escape. Hurriedly, you shoulder your Bow and urge your horse forward in pursuit of the wounded beast. In less than a minute you run it to ground among the pines. Roaring like a cornered tiger, the Skarad swings around and leaps towards your horse with its axe raised high, slashing the air as it strikes. Terrified by its ferocity, your mount rears up and shies away from the creature’s manic attack. You are forced to cling to the pommel of your saddle with your left hand as you fight to prevent the snarling Skarad from hacking your horse to the ground.</p>

<p>You strike a dozen stout branches and sustain several cuts and bruises before you land, dazed and breathless, amidst a clump of thick foliage (lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). Fortunately, the lush vegetation and the soft muddy ground cushion your impact and you are able to stagger to your feet with no bones broken. You lift your weary head and see a glimmer of lantern light through the dense undergrowth and swaying trees. You shout out, hoping to draw Anseng’s attention, but the sound of the teeming rain, the howling winds and the constant thunder makes it impossible for you to be heard.</p>
<p>You force a way through the heavy foliage and emerge from the trees at the edge of the clearing, close by the muddy road. A flash of lightning illuminates the area for a few fleeting moments, yet in that brief instant you are seen by Anseng. You are also spotted by Lord Rimoah who is clinging with all his strength to the prow rail of the <cite>Comet</cite>, high above. He tosses a small object over the skyship’s gunwale which ignites into an intense ball of green flame as it falls. It drops into the tangled grass of the clearing where it continues to burn fiercely. It is a signal flare, acknowledging that you have been seen. It also tells you that your mission must proceed as planned. As you hurry towards the sputtering flare, you see the keel of the skyship turn about and ascend rapidly into the roiling black clouds.</p>
<p>Anseng and his lantern emerge from the trees. Your worried guide pauses for a few moments to get his bearings, then he comes running towards you as fast as his saturated clothing will allow. You rush to meet him at the edge of the road. The noise of the storm has grown much louder since the <cite>Comet</cite> departed, and now the ground shudders alarmingly with every step you take. The sodden soil has become dangerously unstable. Lightning bolts strike the ground, causing fissures that tear open the soft friable earth. You watch with growing dread as parts of the clearing break away and tumble into these treacherous crevasses. A wide fissure opens beneath your feet and you lose your balance. Instantly, a strong hand grabs your forearm and pulls you away from the yawning rift.</p>
<p>‘Steady, my Lord,’ says Anseng, his rain-lashed face lit by the eerie yellow light of his storm lantern. ‘I’ll not see you buried before your mission has begun. Follow close on my heel, sire. Tread only where I tread.’ You nod in agreement and stay close behind your guide as skillfully he makes his way across the treacherous ground towards the tree line on the eastern side of the clearing. Here the earth is more stable; the tangled roots of the tall trees are preventing it from breaking apart and collapsing. Sheltered from the pouring rain by the thick canopy of toa fronds, you pause to rest and recover from your dramatic return to Chai.</p>
<p>Upon checking your equipment, you are dismayed to find that the leather satchel containing your tracker gem is missing. The strap is still slung around your shoulder, but the satchel bag has been torn away during your fall through the trees. Your backpack has also been damaged in the fall, and three items are now missing. (Erase the Tracker Gem from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.

<p>Your eye is drawn to a large and impressive building on the right side of this wide lantern-lit avenue. Its tiled roof has a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners and its sea-green ridge tiles are highly decorated with ceramic figurines. This is the famous public library and records office of Pensei, a repository for tens of thousands of books and ancient parchments collected and preserved here over several centuries. The building and its contents are a worthy testament to the wisdom and enlightenment of the Khea-khans of Chai.</p>

<p>Two Imperial Guardsmen clad in <i xml:lang="x-chaian">ang’sei</i> (the famous Chai waistcoats of golden mail) who are posted at the gates of the Imperial Palace Keep come smartly to attention and salute Captain Voushan as you approach. He acknowledges their salute and you accompany the Captain into the courtyard beyond. The largest building in this exclusive area is the Pensei Pagoda. It is also the oldest and most impressive construction in all of Chai, dating back to the time when the country was first established following the collapse of the Vaduzhan Empire during the Great Civil War of MS 1620.</p>
<p>Upon entering the main concourse of the Pensei Pagoda, you are struck by the lavishness of the interior which recently has been renovated at Khea-khan Lao Tin’s behest. Its panelled walls and ornamented arched doors are exquisitely carved with symbols of historic and religious significance, delicately inlaid with fine gold leaf and myriad pearls. There is an impressive circular skywell positioned above an elegant indoor garden that harbours several dozen miniature trees, all meticulously cultivated and beautifully arranged around a narrow winding stream of shimmering azure water. A grand mahogany staircase dominates the north side of the concourse and ascends to the first storey. It is here that the Grand Throne Room of the Khea-khan is located.</p>
<p>The arched door opens as you reach the top of the staircase and Captain Voushan escorts you into the luxuriously appointed chamber beyond. Every inch of the walls and ceiling are embellished with intricate carvings clad with gold leaf. The effect is dazzling at first sight. Portraits of past Khea-khans and depictions of significant events in Chai’s proud history are displayed around the walls, and in the centre of the chamber there is a grand ebony throne set atop a large rectangular slab of crimson-veined marble. You inspect the throne and you are disappointed to discover that the Eye of Agarash is missing. There is a deep indentation where the gem was mounted. Tell-tale gouges around this indentation reveal that the gem has recently been prised out of its setting.</p>
<p>A robed courtier approaches Captain Voushan and informs him that the Khea-khan is inspecting the west wall defences. He is expected to return within the hour and she invites you to await him here.</p>

<p>Rakhi gives a sudden squeal of delight and points at the pocket of your jacket.</p>
<p>‘You have the Queen!’ she says, excitedly. You draw the playing piece from your pocket and Rakhi begs you to let her look at it. With trembling fingers she examines it closely.</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes… it’s the missing piece I’ve been looking for!’ she gasps.</p>
<p>‘What’s so special about this samor piece?’ you ask, somewhat bemused by her passionate reaction.</p>
<p>‘Wait here, I need to fetch something. I’ll not be long.’ She returns the Samor Queen to you and leaves the table. You watch her hurry across the taproom and disappear through the curtained archway. In less than a minute she returns clutching a mahogany box inlaid with intricate gold designs.</p>
<p>Proudly, she raises the lid revealing a set of beautifully carved samor pieces, each one resting in its own velvet-lined partition. One piece is missing from the set—the Samor Queen.</p>
<p>‘I lost the Queen over a year ago, and I’ve been searching for it ever since to restore my set. This was a present from my late grandmother. She taught me how to play samor when I was a child. I’m not wealthy and I cannot offer you much money for the Queen, but I have something of value that may interest you. Perhaps we can make a deal?’</p>
<p>She clutches a small scarlet gem that is strung around her throat on a fine gold chain. She unhooks its clasp and passes it to you.</p>
<p>‘It belonged to my mother,’ she says. ‘She gave it to me when I joined the troupe. It has magical properties that have kept me safe since I left Durwan, but I’d happily exchange it for the Samor Queen.’</p>
<p>You examine the gem closely and your Sixth Sense reveals that it does indeed have magical properties. It is a Wardstone, one of many such artefacts that were created by the Elder Magi millennia ago. It is imbued with the power to weaken undead creatures.</p>
<p>You agree to Rakhi’s proposal and exchange the Samor Queen for her Wardstone. You may record this Wardstone on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item that you wear around your neck, suspended by its gold chain. If you enter into combat against an undead adversary whilst in possession of this item, you may reduce your enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 3 for the duration of the fight.</p>
<p>Rakhi is delighted. She places the missing Queen into the empty partition of the box and closes the lid.</p>
<p>‘Thank you so much. This means so much to me!’ she says. Then she leans across the table and kisses you fondly on the cheek. It is at this moment that Anseng arrives, having just completed his long conversation with the innkeeper.</p>
<p>‘I see you’ve found a new friend while I’ve been gone,’ he says, with a wry smile, ‘and I must admit, she’s a lot prettier than me.’</p>
<p>Rakhi giggles and bids you both goodnight. She leaves the table and Anseng sits himself opposite you. You ask him about his negotiations with the innkeeper and he nods his head wearily.</p>
<p>‘Lun-chow drives a hard bargain,’ he replies, ‘but we have ourselves two new horses. I had to pay him every Ren I possessed to get them. Don’t worry, my Lord. The Khea-khan is a generous man and he will recompense me once we reach Pensei.’</p>
<p>You pour the last of the Senara Tea into your cup and offer it to your guide. He accepts it gladly and swallows it down in one go. Revived by the tea, he tells you that two rooms for the night were part of the bargain he struck with Lun-chow. He hands you a key and tells you that your room is number 5.</p>
<p>‘We have another long ride ahead of us tomorrow. Let’s get some rest, for we must leave at dawn if we are to reach Pensei by nightfall.’</p>
<p>Together you leave the booth and pass through the curtained archway. Both of your rooms are located on the ground floor, next to each other. Anseng wishes you a good night’s sleep before retiring to his room, number 4.</p>

<p>You wake shortly before dawn and stretch your weary limbs. Quang gets to his feet and awakens each of the snoring Watchers. A daunting ride awaits you all. You have two days in which to cover the 120 miles between Vabou and the location of the lost tracker gem. Mindful that every hour counts, you forego breakfast and mount your horses. In the grey light of dawn, the old highway that bisects the town is busy with townsfolk preparing to leave Vabou while they still can. They are afraid that the enemy will return and have decided to abandon their homes and journey to the distant town of Hi’joi. It is located south-east of Vabou, on the eastern side of the mighty River Tkukoma. They believe that they will find safe sanctuary there.</p>
<p>The rain has eased off overnight to be replaced by a light drizzle. It makes your journey less miserable than it has been since you first arrived in Chai four days ago. The first nineteen miles of your ride towards the village of Zang pass uneventfully. It is not until you approach your twentieth mile on the highway that your Sixth Sense warns you enemies are close. You signal to the others to stop. You stand in the stirrups and scan the surrounding countryside, but all you can see is rain-swept grassland swaying in the wind. There are no signs of the Skarada and Chagarashi that attacked Vabou last night. Satisfied that there appears to be no threat of ambush, you resume the ride towards your rendezvous point. It is not until you are twenty five miles from Vabou that the situation takes a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>A large group of creatures are spotted in the distance. You magnify your vision and see that they are the survivors of last night’s attack. They are blocking the highway and are spread out on either side for half a mile in both directions. You call your companions to a halt and consider the best way to avoid them. Quang suggests you try to circle around to the south, across the Huzang Plain. Bai suggests you may stand a better chance if you enter the foothills of the Szuchow Range to the north and use the cover they provide to get around them that way. Both routes will delay your journey to the rendezvous point significantly. Moreover, you’ll not be able to reach Zang before nightfall and will face having to spend a night in the open in enemy occupied territory.</p>

<p>You let loose your straining bowstring and your Arrow flies straight and true. It strikes the doomwolf between its feral eyes and the sharp tip penetrates deep into its brain, killing it instantly. It falls off the tree bridge and plunges head first into the ravine. The weight on the fallen tree is lessened by the demise of the second doomwolf. You urge your companions to push harder against the pine and it starts to give. The compacted earth beneath it cracks and crumbles.</p>
<p>‘Get clear!’ you shout, and hastily they leap away as the tree trunk sinks with the collapsing edge of the gully. There is a loud rumble and you see the tree and the loosened earth fall away into the yawning fissure. The remaining two doomwolves howl with terror as they tumble off the falling trunk and plummet to their doom at the base of the ravine, one hundred feet below.</p>
<p>Quang and the Watchers are greatly impressed by the way in which you have dealt with the doomwolves. They punch the air and shout in unison: ‘Paizar!’</p>
<p>You smile and nod your head in acknowledgement of their generous praise. As the echo of their cheer fades away among the surrounding trees, you feel a sudden wave of weakness coursing through your body. It makes your stomach churn and leaves you gasping for breath. Once again, the Eye of Agarash has activated and this time it drains you of 5 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>

<p>An elegant Palace courtier takes you gently by the arm and escorts you to your sleeping room on the ground floor. Upon arriving, she opens the mahogany door, bows politely, and motions you to enter. You cross the threshold and stare in amazement at this luxurious bedchamber. The courtier bids you good night and the door closes behind her without a sound.</p>
<p>Fine food and new clothing have thoughtfully been provided for you. You climb out of your damp and travel-stained clothes and ease yourself into the warm water of a sunken marble bath. The scented water soothes your aching limbs. After bathing, you eat before retiring to a majestic bed where you fall asleep as soon as your head touches the soft silk pillow.</p>
<p>You are awoken before dawn by the harmonic tinkling of a small hand bell. You open your eyes and the first thing you see is the smiling face of the courtier. With a soft and lilting voice, she tells you that Lieutenant Quang will be in the concourse in thirty minutes time. You watch as she seemingly glides out of the bed chamber and closes the door. You arise feeling better than you have felt in days. A good night’s rest and a generous helping of shameless luxuriance restore any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you may have lost so far. You get dressed in your new clothes which comprise a crimson leather jacket, black breeches, sturdy black boots, and a dark green oilskin cape with a generous hood. After reequipping yourself with your belt, backpack, weapons and satchel containing the Eye of Agarash, you leave the bedchamber and make your way to the concourse. The three Watchers are here and they bid you good morning. You have all arrived a little early and you have ten minutes to kill before Lieutenant Quang is expected. The palace courtiers bring you each a basket of freshly baked bread, cheese, and slices of veal with exotic fruits and together you eat a hurried breakfast beside the azure stream of the indoor garden before Quang arrives.</p>
<p>The lieutenant appears, clad in his battle dress with his badge of rank prominently displayed on his dark green cloak. He ushers you all to the Imperial stables where you collect your mounts for the journey. They are fine steeds and will serve you well. You pass through the city’s south gate just as dawn is breaking and begin the long ride to Vabou. The rain swept highway is still crowded with refugees but they quickly make way for you when they recognise Quang’s Imperial Guard insignia and you reach the village of Uzam in the early afternoon. You pass by the blacksmithy and general store and notice that both places are now closed and boarded up. You are riding past the tavern when you see Kenga, the tavern owner, appear at an open upper floor window.

<p>It starts to rain as you approach the village of Zang at dusk. This picturesque Chai settlement sits astride the highway amidst a range of rolling hills. To the south-east you can see the darkening peaks of the Huzang Mountains, and to the north-west, beyond the hills, you espy the perimeter of the Northern Huzang Forest. Its giant toa trees are swaying gently in the strengthening breeze. You note that Zang has been spared the ravages of last night’s storm; its shops and dwellings show no signs of damage. Its citizens have finished a hard day’s work and are hurrying back to their homes, anxious to take shelter from the rain and settle down to their evening meals.</p>
<p>Anseng leads you along the muddy main road towards a distant tavern. A brace of copper lanterns creak slowly in the breeze above its shiny red door.</p>
<p>‘We’ll stay here this night,’ says Anseng. ‘The owner’s an old friend and he owes me a favour or two.’</p>
<p>From the shelter of an awning, the owner’s son watches your approach. When he recognises Anseng, he runs forward and takes hold of your horses’ bridles. He bows respectfully to Anseng and bids him welcome.</p>
<p>‘And it’s good to see you again, Jeng,’ replies your guide, as he dismounts. He retrieves his polearm from his saddle and then turns to you and says, ‘Our horses are in good hands, my Lord. Jeng will take care of them. Come, let’s get in out of the rain. I’m so hungry, my stomach’s beginning to think my throat’s been cut!’</p>
<p>You enter the comfortable warmth of the tavern’s taproom. Several of its patrons nod and smile when they recognise Anseng and they do their best to make you both feel most welcome. Tzu, the owner, is not much older than Anseng. He greets him warmly as if he were a long lost brother. He calls out to his doting wife, Yeng Zhi, to go to the kitchen and fetch some hot food for you both.</p>
<p>‘My best rooms are at your disposal, my friends,’ says Tzu, enthusiastically. ‘It’s an honour and a pleasure to have to stay with us this night.’</p>
<p>The hard day’s ride has taken its toll. You are feeling tired and more than a little saddle sore. You may choose to stay in the taproom and eat with Anseng, or you can go to the room that is awaiting you upstairs and eat alone before you settle down for some much needed sleep.</p>

<p>You walk along the paved street, passing closed cook shops and small emporiums that sell clothing, furniture, and fruit, until you arrive at Dwala’s main square. At its centre is a tiered pyramid of veined marble topped by a magnificent sculpture of a dragon roaring at the sky. This is the famous Dwala Dragon, erected at a time when the free citizens of Dwala willingly chose to join the Chai Empire many centuries ago. It is a homage to Nyxator, the wise and goodly dragon who, in 12209 MS, created the Lorestones to preserve the powers and knowledge bestowed upon him by God Kai. These ancient gems contained the secrets and the power of the Magnakai Disciplines that you have mastered. Encircling the base of the pyramid are dozens of market trader stalls wrapped in oilskin tarpaulins and wound round tightly with rope. In more clement times the square is a vibrant open market where thousands of goods are bought, bartered and sold every day. Now it is closed, and it looks like it will remain so for several days to come.</p>
<p>Through the teeming rain, you see two thoroughfares that lead away from the main square. One goes north and is called Izara Street. The other heads west and is named Xo Street. A signpost at the start of Xo Street points due west and reads: <span class="signpost">To the Quay</span>.</p>

<p>Anseng moves towards you, sweeping his glowing <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i> before him like a sorcerous scythe. Resolutely you unsheathe your Kai Weapon, yet as you raise it in readiness to counter his inexorable advance you are engulfed by a wave of nausea that makes you shiver and retch. Once again the Eye has activated, triggered now by the close proximity of the evil power that is driving Anseng to seek your doom: lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>You retreat a few unsteady paces and struggle to suppress the tide of nausea that is sapping your strength. As if sensing your weakness, Anseng lunges forward and thrusts the glowing tip of his cursed weapon at your trembling face.</p>

<p>Priestess Song Tao leads you to an alcove behind the altar and traces her fingertip around one of the engravings on the wall. It activates a secret panel which slides open to reveal a spiral stone staircase. You follow as she climbs to a landing near the top of the tower. A silver-plated door stands before you. Song Tao knocks on this shining door before opening it.</p>
<p>You follow her into a large and impressive circular chamber. Its smooth walls and ceiling are midnight blue in colour and studded with clusters of tiny Caronese crystals. The effect is stunning; it is as if you have just stepped into deep space and are surrounded by thousands of tiny twinkling stars. The chamber is dimly lit by an oil lamp resting on a circular table in the middle of the room. Song Tao raises its wick and the light becomes brighter. It illuminates three people who are seated in winged armchairs on the far side of the chamber. They stand up and Song Tao introduces them to you.</p>
<p>The first is Lord Honos, a journeymage from Dessi. The second is Zautro, a curate Herbwarden from Bautar, and the third is Captain Jian Tzu, the commander of Dwala’s City Guard. He is also the leader of the Watchers and a loyal friend and ally to the Elder Magi. It was Jian Tzu who sent Anseng to meet you on your arrival in Chai and to be your guide. When you tell them what has happened since your arrival in Chai, they are relieved to see you still have the Eye of Agarash safely in your possession. They are also shocked and saddened to learn of the regrettable loss of Anseng, Chao, and Lieutenant Quang. Lord Honos assures you that their sacrifice will not be in vain, and neither will it be forgotten. Zautro the Herbwarden steps forward and asks to see the Eye of Agarash. The others, too, are anxious to view this infamous artefact and they gather round.</p>
<p>When you open the leather satchel, you are assailed by a wave of evil energy that drains you of 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>

<p>The rain has become heavier while you have been in the tavern. You raise the hood of your woollen cloak and hurry towards the blacksmithy on the opposite side of the paved village road. As you approach the open doors, you sense that something is wrong. There is no sign of Anseng or the blacksmith, and Anseng’s horse is also missing. Only your horse remains in the workshop that houses the blacksmith’s forge and anvil. You detect fresh tracks in the rust-red dirt of the floor that lead out of the building. Some were made by a horse; others resemble bare human footprints that are significantly larger than normal sized feet. These tracks were made no more than 15 minutes ago. Then you detect a sound coming from somewhere above the workshop: it is the dull thud of a hammer striking a timber floor.</p>

<p>It is Anseng, but he is no longer how you remember him. His face is grey and gaunt, and his eyes are now empty sockets that radiate a dull blue glow. Stiffly, he turns towards you with his cupped hands outstretched. There is a loud <i>crack</i> and his hands and forearms are wreathed in sparking balls of electric blue fire. Before your disbelieving eyes, these unholy spheres of flame coalesce into a glowing rod that rapidly transforms into the shape of a <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i>. Your Sixth Sense screams a warning that you are in the presence of a great evil that has taken possession of Anseng and turned him into an undead automaton. He opens his mouth as if to scream and the ghastly eyeless head of a black snake emerges from where his tongue should be. He raises his glowing <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i> and scythes the night air with several sweeping strokes. The weapon glows brighter with every stroke he makes.</p>

<p>You reach to your belt pouch, but Shousun has a sudden change of mind.</p>
<p>‘One moment,’ he says. ‘I’ll gladly let you have these ales for free if you’d be so kind to tell me what is happening in the north.’</p>
<p>You look to Quang and he narrows his eyes a little. He is signalling you to say nothing.</p>
<p>‘Come a little closer,’ he says to the inquisitive innkeeper. ‘I will tell you what we know, but I’d prefer that not everyone in your fine establishment hears what I have to say.’</p>
<p>‘Of course, my Lord,’ replies Shousun, with a wry smile. He moves closer to Quang and leans forward so that the Lieutenant can speak quietly in his ear. In a hushed voice, Quang tells him that some of the citizens of Pensei believe their city will be attacked by the Bhanarians. They have decided to leave their homes and travel to Hi’joi by way of Vabou and Klatii. He tells him to have faith in the might of the Chai army and the wisdom of his Khea-khan. If the threat to Pensei is real, we shall prevail.</p>
<p>‘Thank you my Lord,’ says the innkeeper. Having now satisfied his curiosity, Shousun tells you that the ales are on the house. He says that it is an honour to have an Imperial Guardsman visit his humble inn and he invites you all to enjoy a meal and stay the night at his expense. Quang thanks him and accepts his hospitality.</p>

<p>You ride along Maoshen Avenue until you come to a flagstoned square bordered on all sides by exclusive emporiums and luxurious dwellings. An ornate cherry-red sign in the middle of the square indicates the way to the Imperial Palace and you follow an adjoining street eastward until you come to a grand plaza. At its centre stands the Imperial Palace, ringed by a high curtain wall. The plaza is crowded with refugees, huddled together in small groups beneath umbrellas and makeshift tents. Carefully, you steer your horse through the frightened citizens and make your approach to the grand outer gate of the palace. The Imperial Guard sentries watch intently as you ascend the wide stone ramp that leads to the arched gate.</p>

<p>You watch the Chagarashi moving through the trees and tell your companions to remain as still as possible in the hope that it will not detect you. Unfortunately, the creature catches the scent of your horses and turns its feral gaze in your direction. Upon seeing you and your party it reacts in an instant. Swiftly, it turns about and lopes away through the trees in the direction of the roadblock.</p>
<p>‘I must stop it getting away,’ you shout to your companions. ‘If it makes it to the roadblock, we’ll soon have more than one of them to deal with.’</p>
<p>You spur your horse to the gallop and charge at the fleeing Chagarashi. The creature soon realises that it cannot outrun your horse and defiantly it skids to a halt and turns to face you. As your horse bears down on this snarling beast, you unsheathe your Kai Weapon and raise it in readiness to strike the creature a killing blow.</p>

<p>The Doomgah howls with frustration; it can no longer see you. It drops its iron bow and unsheathes its serrated sword. You run to the other side of the wheelhouse and peer around its side to see the Doomgah scurrying along the walkway, slashing at the rain with its black blade in a berserk frenzy. You draw your Kai Weapon as it comes racing down the gangplank, shrieking maniacally. It does not know precisely where you are and you seize this vital advantage. The moment it reaches the stern deck, you spring out from behind the wheelhouse and launch a swift attack.</p>

<p>Your final blow decapitates Xaol and sends his decayed head arcing away into the tempestuous waters of the Tkukoma Estuary. His crippled body drops to the deck and rapidly decays before your eyes. The necromantic spell that raised Xaol from the dead and restored his sundered body has been broken, and now the years of rot and decay that were held at bay rapidly consume his diseased corpse. His serpent rod reverts to its spherical form and lies beside the putrid remains, smoking and hissing intensely.</p>

<p>None of the militiamen are armed with bows, so you order them to keep their heads below the parapet and prepare to strike hard the moment the enemy show themselves.</p>
<p>‘Don’t let them take the parapet walkway!’ you shout.</p>
<p>The Chagarashi lead the attack on the North wall. They leap up and sink their talons deep into the logs and cling on tightly as the Skarada use them like scaling ladders. They clamber up their backs to reach the top of the parapet wall.</p>

<p>A stunning transformation is taking place before your disbelieving eyes. The grey cloaked Nadziran dissolves into a swirling cloud of milky mist that expands and solidifies into a scaly dragon, with frosty-white hide and black fathomless eyes. It opens its jaws to reveal an array of razor-sharp fangs. It roars loudly and a freezing gust of super-cold breath engulfs you, leaving you shivering and chilled to the bone. Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus saves you from a swift and icy death, but Zashnor seizes the advantage its transformation and breath attack has gained and it comes bounding towards you with murderous intent.</p>

<p>You draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Curing and transfer the healing warmth of your Kai Discipline into the body of the dying man. His weak pulse strengthens and his muscles twitch involuntarily, but he does not regain consciousness. Then his heart stops beating and he slips away into the merciful embrace of death. You were unable to save his life but your effort was not entirely in vain, for his passing was without pain. Now your mind is flooded with unanswered questions. Why was he savagely murdered? What kind of beast is capable of such cold-bloodied slaughter? Where is Anseng? Is he still alive or has he, too, met a grisly end?</p>
<p>Galvanised into action by what has happened here, you race down the stairs and mount your horse. Quickly you bring her around to face the open doors and ride out into the pouring rain. The fresh tracks from the Blacksmithy lead you along the paved road until you reach the northern perimeter of the village. Here they leave the highway and veer due east towards the Nagah Forest. A narrow woodsman’s trail snakes its way through the Chai pines and the tracks can clearly be seen in its muddy surface. Your Sixth Sense screams a warning that this dense forest harbours an evil presence. You rein in your horse and scan the surrounding trees. At once you detect an ambush has been prepared and several evil creatures are lying in wait for you on the trail ahead.</p>

<p>You shout to the others to grab their bows and fire on the leading doomwolf. Quickly they obey and send a volley of well-aimed arrows whistling towards the pack leader. The missiles strike it in the face and chest, killing it instantly and sending its lifeless body hurtling down into the ravine. Its companions halt dead in their tracks, baying and snarling angrily.</p>
<p>‘Dislodge the trunk!’ you cry and leap from your saddle. Quang and the Watchers drop their bows, jump off their horses and together you run to the edge of the ravine. You put your shoulders to the fallen pine and push with all your strength, determined to send it toppling into the deep fissure along with the three remaining doomwolves. The heavy trunk begins to shift but only a little. The first in the line of remaining doomwolves senses what you are trying to do and it musters enough courage to come loping across the tree bridge.</p>

<p>You draw upon your mastery of Elementalism to create a sphere of calm air around your body. It helps you to maintain your grip on the ladder and protects you from the crackling energy of the storm. To your dismay, you look down and see the ladder being torn from Anseng’s grasp by the shuddering rise and fall of the stricken skyship. Desperately, you cling to the saturated ropes, your stomach churning with every sudden swerve and violent jolt. A fearsome bolt of lightning hits the stern of the skyship and propels it away from the clearing, swinging you dangerously close to the tops of the surrounding trees. You glimpse the light of Anseng’s lantern moving across the clearing as he chases the end of the rope ladder. Moments later, the skyship is struck again by lightning and this time it lists heavily to starboard. The ropes are wrenched from your grasp as the ladder whips towards the canopy of the trees, sending you tumbling and crashing through the dense canopy of toa fronds.</p>

<p>A short way along Xiang Street there is brightly lit emporium that buys and sells all manner of goods. Quang wants to purchase a new compass; his army issue one was broken during the fighting at Vabou. You enter this spacious shop and stare in awe at the thousands of items it has for sale. Quang and Deng approach the counter and while the Lieutenant is examining an array of compasses, you browse the shelves. All of the items are labelled and priced. Four of them catch your eye:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrows: 10 Ren each (1 Gold Crown each)</li>
<li>Lantern: 20 Ren (2 Gold Crowns)</li>
<li>Rope (50 ft. length): 30 Ren (3 Gold Crowns)</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur: 40 Ren (4 Gold Crowns) Restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> when swallowed after combat.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may buy any of the items listed above for the price indicated. With the exception of the Arrows, they are all Backpack Items that will take up one space in your backpack. You are under no obligation to make a purchase.</p>
<p>You can also sell any of the items you have noted on your Backpack List (with the exception of Anseng’s <i xml:lang="x-chaian">Kirusami</i>). The shop will pay 20 Ren for each item, regardless of how much it originally cost. If you wish to sell any of your items, erase them from your list and add 2 Gold Crowns (20 Ren) per item to your Belt Pouch.</p>
<p>Quang finally decides which compass he is going to purchase and he hands 50 Ren to the shop assistant. The wife of the emporium’s owner approaches him and they exchange a few words. She is concerned about Deng’s morose demeanour and suggests that he would benefit from some Senara Tea. Quang agrees and he gives her 10 Ren. In return, she reaches for a bottle of the tea from the shelf behind her and places it on the counter. Quang uncorks the bottle and makes Deng drink it. The soothing liquid will help him to recover from his state of shock. When he has consumed the contents, you thank the woman and leave.</p>
<p>At the end of Xiang Street you enter the quayside area. The churning waters of the estuary stretch out before you. Because of the heavy rain and failing light, you cannot see across the estuary to the opposite bank and have no way of judging how wide it is at this point. Quang asks a passer-by for directions to the ferry post and she points south and tells you that it is a five minute walk is that direction. Soon you reach the post and see the ferry boat to Dwala is moored at the quay.

<p>Unfortunately, your answer is incorrect. The amounts are the same. After mixing in a quart of oil, the mixture would by ⅚ vinegar and ⅙ oil. This would leave ⅚ of a quart of oil in the first pitcher. Since the other ⅚ of the removed mixture is vinegar, and this is now mixed into the other pitcher, in the end both pitchers end up with ⅚ of a quart of the other liquid in them. As they have equal amounts of the other liquid, and the total volumes are equal (back to 5 quarts each), they must have equal amounts of their original liquids.</p>

<p>You attack the five undead Nagah Ghouls before they can scramble back to their feet. Lieutenant Quang fights fiercely by your side, and the three Watchers engage those ghouls that attempt to outflank you. Your use of the Kai power-word has given you the combat advantage. You may ignore any <small>ENDURANCE</small> point losses you sustain in the first 2 rounds of this fight:</p>

<p>You may add 6 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the duration of this fight, for Quang and the Watchers are supporting you in this battle.</p>
<p>If you win this combat, Quang decapitates the heads of the fallen enemy to prevent them from being reanimated by the evil energy that has kept them in an undead state for centuries. As he chops off the head of the last Nagah Ghoul with his <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i>, you feel a chilling aura radiating from the Eye of Agarash. A sudden wave of weakness drains you of 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>As the nausea subsides, you turn your attention to the Watchers who have all sustained wounds during the combat. By the use of your Magnakai Curing Discipline, you are able to stop their bleeding and help them quickly to recover. You sense that you must now leave this location for there are more Nagah Ghouls in the vicinity and they are heading for the tavern garden, drawn by the foul smell of the spilt blood of their slain brethren. Hurriedly, you all remount your horses and press on with your journey to Vabou without further delay.</p>

<p>Once the puzzling is done and the successful wagers have all been paid out, the taproom settles down and the patrons resume their drinking and convivial conversations. Quang and Deng both won their wagers, but it does little to lift Deng’s sullen mood. The innkeeper leaves his counter in the capable hands of his two sons and comes out to mingle with his customers. The storms have been good for business and he is in high spirits. When he passes by your table, Quang stops him and asks if he has any room for the night.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry, my Lord,’ he replies. ‘We’re completely full. Even my attic and stables are occupied tonight.’</p>
<p>‘Do you know if anyone is crossing the estuary before nightfall?’ asks Quang.</p>
<p>‘Not if they know what’s best for them. There’ve been no boats on the waters for the past three days. The ferry is closed and the fishermen are all safely tucked up at home. Well, those that aren’t in here that is!’</p>

<p>Elder Qinlau sees to it that your horses are stabled here at Militia Headquarters. Meanwhile, Captain Xing writes two notes informing his militia sergeants that you and Lieutenant Quang are authorised to take command of their companies. Then he hurries away to the bell tower and rings the bell. It warns the townsfolk that Vabou is in imminent danger of attack and it calls the militia to their battle posts at the watchtowers and along the perimeter walls.</p>
<p>A small group of boys gather at the Militia headquarters. They are messengers who are charged with conveying written orders from Captain Xing to the militiamen. They will also carry reports back from the palisade wall to keep the Captain abreast of any changes in the situation. One of the boys is ordered to take you to the North Watchtower. Another is assigned to Lieutenant Quang and the Watchers who will go to the West Watchtower. As the boys are collecting the notes that Captain Xing has written, Quang and the Watchers bid you good luck and good hunting. You agree to meet back here after the battle, assuming the fight goes in your favour.</p>
<p>The messenger boy escorts through the teeming rain to the North Watchtower. When you arrive, he hands Captain Xing’s note to the sergeant in command of the men stationed here. The man’s eyes widen with surprise the moment he reads the note and realises who you are: the Slayer of Sejanoz! You instruct him to show you the watchtower and adjoining walls so that you can best deploy his company of militiamen. With pride, he takes you into the tower and up a wooden staircase that leads to the parapet walkway. You order five militiamen to man the tower and deploy the others along the palisade wall. As they hurry to get in position, you see some of the enemy horde approaching the north wall through the sheeting rain. As they come closer, your heart sinks. These Skarada are being led by six Chagarashi. In unison, the snarling horrors throw back their heads and let loose a chorus of bloodcurdling shrieks; it is the signal to attack!</p>

<p>Steadily, you catch up with Quang and the Watchers. As you rejoin them, you see something blocking the highway in the middle distance. A score of Skarada are shambling along the highway towards you. They took cover in the tall grass when you and your companions rode along this section of the highway two hours ago, and now they are trying to rejoin the survivors of last night’s battle. You signal to the others to get off the highway and divert east across the open grassland, towards the western edge of the Tviloi Forest which is visible on the horizon. They acknowledge your command and together you gallop due east. As you race across the open plain, you are able to shake off most of the pursuing doomwolves before you reach the distant tree-line.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the forest you find that the pines are widely spaced and you are able to maintain your fast pace with relative ease. However, this sparse border also makes it easy for a determined handful of doomwolves to maintain their pursuit. The rumble of distant thunder and flashes of sheet lightning herald the return of heavy rain. This sudden change in the weather works to your advantage, dampening the scent of your horses and making it harder for the few remaining doomwolves to track you. At length you come to a denser part of the forest that forces your mounts to slow their pace. It is criss-crossed with several narrow but deep gullies. You work your way around these fissures until you arrive at one that is much longer than the others. It stretches across your path and, at first glance, there appears to be no way to traverse it.</p>
<p>‘Over there!’ shouts Quang, pointing along the gully towards the east. He has spotted a dead pine that has fallen across this narrow ravine. Its trunk spans the yawning gap and provides a natural bridge to the far side.</p>
<p>Quang takes the lead and you follow him in single file as he steers his horse safely across the fallen pine. When you reach the far side, you hear the ominous growl of a doomwolf close behind. The pack leader and three of its foul brood are in hot pursuit. They have already reached the middle of the tree bridge and will soon be upon you unless you can do something to halt their swift and determined advance.</p>

<p>After the two of you have consumed the food, Lun-chow escorts you to the rear of the inn and ushers you into a small green-tiled stable. Two fine mares are saddled ready for you to collect. You mount up and Lun-chow bids you both a safe journey as you leave his stable.</p>

You dismount and tether your horses beneath an open-sided shelter at the side of the two-storey house. Chao leads you around to the front door and knocks four times. You hear the sound of scurrying feet and the door swings open. Before you stands Shen-Yin, Chao’s wife. She beams with delight when she sees her husband and throws herself into his open arms. She is clearly overjoyed by his unexpected return. Chao motions you to enter and you go through into a parlour where five young children are sitting in a circle on the pine wood floor in front of a brick fireplace. They are happily playing with their toys. They look at you with quizzical expressions, but when they see their father in the doorway behind they leap to their feet and rush to embrace him.</p>
<p>Shen-Yin relinquishes her hold on Chao and welcomes you to their home. With some difficulty, Chao gently extricates himself from the grip of his excited children and introduces you to his wife. Bai needs no introduction for he has visited here many times in the past. Chao tells Shen-Yin that you are bound for Valus on imperial business and that you can only stay here overnight. She is understandably disappointed to hear that her husband will be home for such a short time, but she puts on a brave face and draws comfort from the fact that they are together again, albeit briefly. She gathers the children and shoos them upstairs so that you have the parlour to yourselves. Then she disappears into the kitchen to prepare some tea and food for you all.</p>
<p>After a simple but reviving meal and copious cups of tea, Chao and Shen-Yin retire upstairs leaving you and the others to sleep on the parlour floor. There is not much room but you are all thankful to be out of the rain and in warm home on this bleak and stormy night. You fall asleep with ease but you do not rest easily. You are haunted by dreams filled with sinister shadowy images and premonitions of impending loss. Thrice you awaken during the night, drenched in cold sweat, and each time you do you find it hard to go back to sleep. Due to your poor night’s sleep and the chilling nightmares you have suffered, you lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Chao wakes you all up at dawn. While you are checking your equipment and preparing for another long day in the saddle, Shen-Yin prepares breakfast and brings it to you in the parlour. While you are eating, Quang tells you that it is a thirty mile ride from here to Valus and he wants to reach the town by late afternoon. You finish your food while listening to the sounds of the children playing in their room above. When the time comes to leave, Quang, Bai, and Deng go and feed the horses while you and Chao help Shen-Yin to clear away the breakfast dishes. You bid her thanks and walk to the front door to go and assist the others. Chao holds his doting wife in a warm and loving embrace and assures her that he will return soon. You are touched by the deep affection they have for each other. Quietly, you exit the door and see Quang leading two horses, yours and Chao’s, out of the shelter by their reins. You climb into the saddle and hold Chao’s horse alongside. Soon you are joined by Quang, Bai, and Deng astride their mounts and patiently you wait for Chao to appear. After a few minutes, Quang calls out:</p>
<p>‘It’s time to go, Chao!’</p>
<p>The door opens and Chao and his wife share a final embrace in the doorway before Chao, sheepishly, bids a final farewell to his wife and climbs into the saddle. With a wave, Shen-Yin bids you goodbye and Godspeed as you set off along the highway heading east from Jueng.</p>

If you already possess the maximum number of Special Items allowed, you must now discard one in its favour. The Eye radiates an evil energy that will periodically drain you of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. You will be told whenever this energy drain occurs.

<p>‘Chagarashi!’ screams Anseng, ‘Ishir save us!’</p>
<p>The ghastly creatures detect the scent of the frightened wagon horses and detach themselves from the tattered remains of their victims. With murderous intent, they come loping along the muddy highway with their bloodied mouths agape.</p>
<p>‘We must protect the horses!’ shouts Anseng, and hurriedly he dismounts from the wagon and unshoulders his <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i>. Your mount is overcome with sheer terror. He rears up and you are thrown out of the saddle onto the muddy ground. Before you can attempt to calm him, he bolts and gallops away along the highway you have just travelled.

<p>You follow this street towards the quayside. Halfway along it you see a cook shop selling hot food and cold tea. Quang decides to enter this shop to purchase something that he is certain will help the despondent Deng: a bottle of Senara Tea. Quang pays the shopkeeper 10 Ren and the man places the bottle on the shop counter. Quang uncorks it and makes Deng drink it all down. The soothing liquid will help him to recover from his state of shock. When he has consumed the last drop, Quang thanks the shopkeeper and you leave.</p>
<p>At the end of street you arrive at the quayside area. The churning waters of the estuary stretch out before you. Because of the heavy rain and failing light, you cannot see across the estuary to the opposite bank and have no way of judging how wide it is at this point. You find the ferry post and see the ferry boat to Dwala moored alongside the quay. You approach it, hoping that you are in time to catch the dusk crossing, but only to discover that the gangplank has been chained off. A sign hanging from the chain says: <span class="signpost">Ferry cancelled due to weather</span>.</p>
<p>A hundred yards along the quayside, Lieutenant Quang spots a small brick built cabin with a roof of thick red tiles. It is the Coast Guard station and he marches towards it at a brisk pace. Inside you find the Quay Master seated at his desk. He is hunched over a detailed map of the Tkukoma Estuary with a mug of steaming jala cupped in his hands. Quang asks him if he has any Coast Guard boats operational in the estuary and the thin-faced Quay Master snorts with derision.</p>
<p>‘In this weather? Not likely!’</p>
<p>‘Then by the power vested in me by Khea-khan Lao Tin, I am commandeering one of your boats,’ replies Quang, officiously, and he shows the Quay Master his insignia of rank. The man looks at his insignia, then he looks at you and Deng and he bursts out laughing.</p>
<p>‘I am not joking,’ retorts Quang. ‘I demand you let me inspect your fleet.’</p>
<p>‘My fleet?’ replies the Quay Master, chuckling under his breath. ‘Very well, I’ll show you my fleet. Follow me.’</p>
<p>You leave the Coast Guard station and follow the Quay Master along the quayside to a small rowing boat tethered by a rope to an iron ring in the wall.</p>
<p>‘There, that’s my fleet. All that’s left of it that is. You’re welcome to commandeer it if you wish.’</p>
<p>The Quay Master turns on his heel and marches back to his station, laughing all the way. You look down at the rowing boat and your heart sinks. It is a sturdily built craft but there is only enough room for two. If the three of you were to attempt to cross the stormy estuary in this tiny boat it would surely capsize. Quang places his hand on Deng’s shoulder and the Watcher raises his head and looks unblinkingly into the Lieutenant’s steely eyes.</p>
<p>‘I am discharging you of your duties, Deng,’ he says. ‘You have served loyally and bravely and I will commend you to the Khea-khan. Return to the cavalry barracks and join with Bai. Accompany him on his ride back to Jueng tomorrow.’</p>
<p>Deng nods his head and salutes the Lieutenant. He wishes you both good luck before he leaves the quayside and walks away into the teeming rain. You watch him go. He does not look back.</p>
<p>‘It is best he goes with Bai tomorrow,’ says Quang. ‘If they should run into the enemy during their journey, they’ll stand a better chance of surviving than if Bai were to go alone.’</p>
<p>‘It will be hard on them to tell Shen-Yin that she has lost her husband,’ you reply.</p>
<p>‘Yes… yes it will,’ says Quang, his voice tinged with bitter sadness. ‘Her husband… and her sister too. When I spoke with Bai at the stables, he told me that when he searched the farm house next to the barn, he found the bodies of Shen-Yin’s sister and her husband. Both had been murdered by the Skarada.’</p>
<p>‘This is so sad,’ you reply, ‘I pray that Ishir will give her strength to bear her grievous loss.’</p>
<p>Quang walks to the edge of the quay and loosens the rope securing the rowboat.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps we should wait until the storm abates,’ you say.</p>
<p>‘There’s no chance of any improvement in this foul weather,’ replies Quang. ‘We could be waiting here for days. It’s not uncommon for it to be stormy at this time of the year, but I’ve never known anything like this. I fear there are dark forces in play. We must reach Dwala and you must deliver the Eye to the Elder Magi as soon as possible. The crossing will be difficult but it will not be impossible. We must place our trust in God Kai to see us through to the other side, and we must be away at once. It’s now or never.’</p>
<p>You step into the boat and set the oars into the rowlocks. Quang casts off and you commence your voyage out into the treacherous waters of the Tkukoma Estuary.</p>

<p>You recite the words of the spell and point your left hand at the creature. The tingling power of Brotherhood magic flows along your arm and erupts from your fingertips. In an instant, a blinding bolt of electrical energy arcs along the pier towards the creature’s armoured chest. It reacts with stunning speed, catching the crackling bolt on the blade of its polearm and grounding it to the wet stone-block surface of the pier. The bolt flares briefly and vanishes in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>The Skarada are less than thirty feet away when Lieutenant Quang shouts ‘Fire!’ As one, you release your straining bowstrings and send a volley of Arrows whistling into the advancing enemy. The missiles all hit their mark and the four Skarada tumble forwards, mortally wounded. Quang compliments everyone on their fine bowmanship and orders you all to shoulder your bows. You comply with his order and follow behind as he canters his horse towards the fallen Skarada. Two of them have been killed outright, and the remaining two are swiftly put out of their misery by the blade of Quang’s <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i>.</p>
<p>Your Sixth Sense warns you that these Skarada are not the only ones of their kind occupying the tree-line. Another two groups are now rushing towards this area, from the east and the south. Fearing that you could be surrounded by them when they converge, you shout a warning to Lieutenant Quang and he quickly mounts his horse and brings it alongside yours.</p>
<p>‘We can’t go forward and we daren’t go any deeper into the forest,’ he says, thoughtfully. ‘We’d best take our chances out on the plain. We’re behind the Chagarashi roadblock now. If the highway is clear between the roadblock and Vabou, we’ll ride there directly.’ You agree with the Lieutenant’s plan and pass the word to the Watchers. Together, you turn your horses to the west and ride out from the tree-line, heading for the highway two miles beyond the open grassland.</p>

<p>You retrieve 3 Gold Crowns from your belt pouch and place them in girl’s hand. She thanks you politely and returns to the counter. From snippets of conversation you overhear, you learn that the entertainers are a band of travelling troubadours who hail from the city of Durwan in Lissan. They are on their way back to their native city after having performed in several taverns and inns of Pensei. The musicians begin to play a lively tune and a trio of pretty dancing girls whirl and twirl around the taproom to the delight of the patrons. One of the girls is wearing a tight-fitting red silk dress, and she glances repeatedly in your direction as she gyrates around the room. It appears that she has taken a special interest in you.</p>
<p>When the performance comes to a close, the patrons give a loud cheer and the girls pass among them collecting donations of Ren from the appreciative audience. After the money has been gathered up, the troubadours thank the Chai for their generosity and leave the taproom by way of the curtained archway. A few minutes later, the girl in the red silk dress reappears. With a charming smile, she comes and sits opposite you at your table. She tells you her name is Rakhi and says she has never seen anyone quite like you before. She asks if you are a Northlander. Your senses detect that she is genuinely friendly and does not intend to do you any harm. You reply that you are indeed a Northlander, but you refrain from telling her exactly which realm of the Northlands you hail from. ‘I thought so,’ she beams, joyfully. ‘I have something that may be of interest to you.’</p>
<p>She places a velvet satchel on the table and flips it open. It contains four ceramic phials, each one stoppered with a cork and carefully labelled and priced. She invites you to inspect them and gives an assurance that they are all genuine potions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laumspur (will restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when swallowed after combat): 50 Ren / 5 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Tazheng (a powerful anti-venom): 60 Ren / 6 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Tincture of Sabito root (rare in this part of Magnamund, Sabito enables the human body to extract oxygen from water through the skin, thus permitting anyone who swallows it to ‘breathe’ underwater): 80 Ren / 8 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Karmo: 120 Ren (12 Gold Crowns). When taken before combat, this potion doubles your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score for the duration of the combat. It has heavy side effects that sometimes can result in death. After consuming Karmo, you must pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. The number you choose determines how many <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you lose as a consequence of the side effects (0 = zero).</li>

<p>As you continue your ride south, the cloud and persistent rain becomes increasingly darker and heavier. The tall grassland gradually recedes and your horses are able to pick up their pace, but you are sorely aware that the easier going will also help the Skarada to track you. After an hour spent crossing the plain, you spot something in the distance that makes you call your companions to a halt. You magnify your vision and focus on the dark shape ahead.</p>
<p>‘What is it, my Lord?’ asks Quang, anxiously.</p>
<p>‘Skarada,’ you reply, uneasily. ‘Lots of Skarada.’</p>
<p>You can see a large formation of the creatures more than five hundred strong. They are moving towards the east and are crossing your route of escape. The lieutenant proposes that you change direction and head south-eastwards. This will put you on a course to Vabou and should enable you to reach the town ahead of the Skarada horde. You and the Watchers agree to the lieutenant’s proposal and together you set off at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>You reach the west gate of Vabou shortly after dark. The two sentries posted here come smartly to attention and salute the instant they recognize Quang’s Imperial Guard insignia. Hurriedly they push open the gate and you ride into the town, along the same road that you travelled two days ago when you arrived here by wagon with Anseng and Chengu. Quang takes the lead and the rest of you follow as he canters his horse along the lantern-lit road to a junction at the centre of the town. He is familiar with Vabou, having stopped here overnight on many occasions whilst travelling from Pensei to Valus to meet with the town’s military commander.</p>
<p>Quang crosses the junction and brings his horse to a halt before a large green-tiled two storey building with a tall bell tower. It is the house of the town elder and headquarters of the Vabou militia. You all dismount and follow the lieutenant through its ornate arched doorway. When you stride into the reception hall, you find Elder Qinlau and Militia Captain Xing seated at a large pine table heaped with parchments. They are locked in conversation. Both of them turn their heads, recognise the familiar face of Lieutenant Quang, and immediately stand up and salute him.</p>
<p>‘It’s an unexpected pleasure to see you again, Quang,’ says Captain Xing. ‘But what brings you here at this late hour?’</p>
<p>The lieutenant tells Captain Xing of your difficult journey from Pensei, your encounter with the Skarada and your discovery of the refugee massacre in the hills. Both Elder Qinlau and Xing are visibly shocked by his chilling report. Quang informs them that a large force of Skarada is heading for Vabou from the west, and he urges Xing to muster his militiamen and deploy them on the palisade wall at once. He is certain that the enemy will attack Vabou during the night.</p>
<p>The Captain tugs a large scroll from under the pile of documents and clears the table with one swift sweep of his arm. Quickly, he unfurls the parchment and lays it out on the bare table top. It is a detailed plan of Vabou. He motions Quang and yourself to come forward and examine it.</p>
<p>‘You’ll see that there are four watchtowers located in palisade wall, at the north, south, east and west corners. I have only 100 militiamen at my command, just 25 men to deploy at each of the towers and its adjoining section of wall.’</p>
<p>‘The Skarada will most likely attack either the west or north wall,’ says Quang, ‘I suggest you deploy 30 militiamen at each of these points, man the south and east watchtowers with 5 men apiece, and hold back a mobile reserve of 30 men ready to plug any gaps or counter any enemy that break through the walls.’ Captain Xing nods in agreement.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Quang asks the Captain if he may take a few minutes to speak to you and the Watchers. The Captain consents and Quang takes you and the Watchers to one side. He speaks with a hushed voice.</p>
<p>‘My Lord, our only hope of getting you to your rendezvous in two days’ time is if we help Captain Xing to defeat the Skarada. We all saw this afternoon that the enemy is moving in force towards this town from the west. It’s certain the first few miles of the highway to H’lau are now in their hands. If we can defeat them when they attack Vabou, we may get a chance to break out of the town and head for H’lau across the Huzang Plain. Clearly, it’s now too late to leave Vabou by the south road. If we were to try to reach Klatii in the rain and darkness, the Skarada would slay us before we’d got beyond a mile of the town’s south gate.’ You all know that Quang is correct and, as one, you consent to his proposal; you will stay and fight.</p>
<p>‘We will help with the defence,’ says Quang, much to Captain Xing’s relief. His militia are adequately armed, but they are not trained soldiers. They will fight hard to protect their town and their families, of this he is sure, but he is afraid they will be no match for the Skarada in close combat. It will greatly improve the odds to have a Kai Grand Master, an Imperial Bodyguard, and three able Watchers fighting alongside them. Both Xing and Elder Qinlau thank you for your help. The Captain says that your service would be best put to use where the threat of attack is greatest: at the West and North watchtowers.</p>

<p>At once you recognise the creatures responsible for this carnage; they are Skarada. Bai and Deng are so shocked and outraged when they see this terrible scene that they cannot suppress their anger. Vehemently, they curse the murdering bloodthirsty beasts. Lieutenant Quang hisses at them to be quiet but their curses have already reached the ears of the closest Skarada. One of them emits a piercing shriek and a dozen of its confederates respond immediately. They cease their gruesome feasting and come bounding up the slope of the hill towards your position.</p>

<p>The Chai rangers are expert horsemen riding strong horses and steadily they close the gap between you. It will be impossible for you to outdistance them. Upon realising this, you decide that another course of action is needed. You rein in your horse and turn her into the refugee column, forcing your way across the flow of wagons and people. The moment you reach the opposite side of the highway, you urge your mare to the gallop and head due west towards a range of low hills. They will provide you with good cover in which to shake off the Chai cavalrymen who have followed in your wake and are now pursuing you across rain-swept grassland.</p>
<p>The rangers give up the chase as soon as you enter the hills. Reluctantly, they turn their horses around and ride back to the highway. As you watch them go, you resolve to head north through the hills and attempt to return to the highway nearer Pensei.

By the use of your Magnakai Curing Discipline, you are able to stop their bleeding and help them quickly to recover. You sense that you must now leave this location for there are more Nagah Ghouls in the vicinity and they are heading for the tavern garden, drawn by the foul smell of the spilt blood of their slain brethren. Hurriedly, you all remount your horses and press on with your journey to Vabou without further delay.</p>

<p>You collect your horse and continue along Tzushen Avenue until you come to a large junction called the Zha-zhing Circle. Several thoroughfares converge at this place, like the spokes of a giant wheel joining its hub. An ornate green sign indicates the way to the Imperial Palace and you follow the street until it arrives at a grand plaza. At its centre stands the Imperial Palace, ringed by a high curtain wall. The plaza is crowded with refugees, huddled together in small groups beneath umbrellas and makeshift tents. Carefully, you steer your horse through the frightened citizens and make your approach to the grand outer gate of the palace. The Imperial Guard sentries watch intently as you ascend the wide stone ramp that leads to the arched gate.</p>

<p>You walk along the paved avenue, passing by closed cook shops and small emporiums that sell clothing, furniture, and fruit, until you arrive at Dwala’s main square. At its centre is a tiered pyramid of veined marble topped by an impressive sculpture of a dragon roaring at the sky. This is the famous Dwala Dragon, erected at a time when the free citizens of Dwala willingly chose to join the Chai Empire many centuries ago. It is a homage to Nyxator, the wise and goodly dragon who, in 12209 MS, created the Lorestones to preserve the powers and knowledge bestowed upon him by God Kai. These ancient gems contained the secrets and the power of the Magnakai Disciplines that you have mastered. Encircling the base of the pyramid are dozens of traders stalls wrapped in oilskin tarpaulins and wound round tightly with rope. In more clement times the square is a vibrant open market where thousands of goods are bought, bartered, and sold every day. Now it is closed, and it looks like it will remain so for several days to come.</p>
<p>Through the teeming rain, you see two streets that lead away from the main square. One goes north and is called Izara Avenue. The other heads west and is named Xo Street. A signpost at the start of Xo Street points due west and reads: <span class="signpost">To the Quay</span>.</p>

<p>‘Mmm, a Sommlending Crown,’ he mutters. ‘Long time since I’ve seen one. Good gold these are. Pure gold. Better than silver Ren any day.’</p>
<p>He tucks the crown into his waistcoat pocket and whips the reins again. You command the horses to go on and at once they respond to your silent command.</p>
<p>Frequent bolts of lightning illuminate the muddy highway as you travel the short distance to Dwala’s south gate. The driver pulls his team to a halt a hundred yards short of the gate and you climb down onto the rutted highway. The instant you are off the wagon, he whips the reins and urges his horses forward.</p>
<p>As you walk towards the gate in the pouring rain, you observe a guard step out of his sentry post and talk briefly with the driver before allowing his wagon to enter. When you reach the gate shortly after the wagon has passed through, the guard steps forward and demands that you pay the night entry toll. Passage in and out of the city is free during the hours of daylight, but after dark a toll of 20 Ren (2 Gold Crowns) is imposed on all non-residents wishing to enter, and 10 Ren (1 Gold Crown) on all those wanting to leave.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Quang enters the farm house. Once he has checked that the dwelling is empty, he beckons the Watchers to join him. You take up a position on the threshold of the creaking door and jam your foot against it to hold it open.</p>
<p>The interior of the farm house shows signs of having been abandoned in a hurry. The embers of a log fire are still aglow in its stone fireplace, and the remnants of a hastily eaten meal remain on the table. The Watchers seat themselves around the table and rest their weary heads in their hands. Quang remains standing. Chao, Bai, and Deng are close to tears. They have been badly affected by the massacre of the refugees. You listen to Quang as he tries to console them but they are consumed with grief and do not respond. Then he reminds them that they must put duty first. Escorting you to your rendezvous place must be their first and foremost concern. By fulfilling this goal they will help bring about the swift avenging of the murdered refugees. The lieutenant’s words inspire the Watchers and they draw strength from them. Soon they are able to compose themselves and refocus on doing their duty.</p>
<p>Quang is able to gather enough food from the kitchen shelves to provide everyone with a meal. He brings you a bowl of cold boiled rice and diced raw vegetables before joining the others seated around the table. As they eat in silence, you eat your food with your fingers while you scour the surrounding countryside. Soon you detect movement along the ridge of distant hills. You magnify your vision and see a war party of Skarada moving rapidly along the hillcrest. They are heading in your direction.</p>
<p>‘They’re coming!’ you shout, and your warning galvanises your companions into action. As one, they rise from the table and quickly gather their weapons and equipment. In less than a minute you are all back in the saddle and heading south, eager to avoid being caught by the murderous Skarada.</p>

<p>The evil power that brought Anseng back from the dead is the same fell force that has compelled the Skarada and Chagarashi to attack Vabou this night. By slaying the undead Anseng, you have banished this force and broken the spell that has driven the creatures to assault the town walls. The Skarada that are fighting Quang and the Watchers are devastated by the sudden lifting of the spell and their nerve shatters. Desperately, they break off from the fight and scramble to escape through the hole in the palisade wall.</p>
<p>Quang and the Watchers let them go. They have put up a good fight against a strong enemy, but they have all sustained wounds in the combat. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Curing, you staunch their wounds and repair the gouges and punctures caused by Skarada fangs and talons. Your companions are thankful to have you on their side. As they carry out a makeshift repair on the hole in the East wall, you return to Anseng’s ashes and offer up a silent prayer to God Kai to save the soul of this brave man. You are finishing your prayer when you hear the sound of the bell tolling in the tower at militia headquarters. It is announcing victory; the battle has been won!</p>
<p>You return to the militia headquarters where you are greeted by a jubilant Elder Qinlau and Captain Xing. The enemy are fleeing from Vabou and the town has been spared the massacre that would surely have followed if they had broken through the palisade wall. Quang and the Watchers are exhausted and in desperate need of rest. You resolve to get some sleep here at the headquarters and leave at daybreak. Elder Qinlau provides you all with food (restore 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small>) before you take your leave and go to the stables.

<p>The smell of spilt Chagarashi blood makes your horse whinny with fear. You draw on your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control to calm him, and you rally Quang and the Watchers with a stirring battle cry you know they will respond to: ‘For Chai!’</p>
<p>The Skarada are now fast closing in around the open barn doors. They are armed with flint axes and long-bladed bone daggers. You dig your heels into your horse’s flanks and jolt him forward in a desperate effort to escape before the Skarada can block the exit. Your horse is back under your control and he responds at once to your actions. He bolts through their closing ranks and you gallop away along the muddy farm track. Quang and the Watchers follow in your wake. The snarling Skarada slash and stab at them as they race out of the barn, forcing to them run a deadly gauntlet before they can get away.</p>
<p>You come to the end of the farm track and turn your horse to the east. When you look back towards the barn, you are relieved to see that all of your companions have escaped and are galloping along the track towards the farm entrance. By the time the Skarada reach the farm’s split pine fence, you are all racing along the highway in the pelting rain with your heads down and your cheeks pressed close to your horses’ necks.</p>
<p>Only when you can no longer see the farmstead and the Skarada do you signal to Quang and the others to bring their horses to a halt. Your mounts are breathless and their sweaty flanks steam in the pouring rain. Your companions, too, are weary. They slump in their saddles and struggle to regain their composure. Quang comes forward and halts his horse alongside yours.</p>

<p>‘If we don’t come for you,’ replies Jian Tzu, ‘then the situation here will have escalated beyond our control. You should remain hidden aboard the ship. Once it sails and is safely beyond the estuary, you should make yourself known to the Captain. His name is Chengan. He is a Watcher and he is loyal to our cause. He will convey you to the Port of Suhn and from there you will be able to make contact with your Kai Monastery on the Isle of Lorn. We will send word of this to Lord Rimoah… if we are able.’</p>
<p>You acknowledge the Captain’s words and set off from the kitchen doorway. But you have barely taken a dozen steps along the alleyway when you see a group of leathery black creatures appear in the passageway beyond. They are armed with iron bows. One of them raises its bow and a black arrow comes speeding directly towards your head!</p>

<p>Lieutenant Quang nods in agreement and you lead him and the Watchers away from the halted refugee column and ride west towards the southern end of the Szuchow hills. The grass and mixed foliage is taller and denser here than it is on the east side of the highway and you make slow progress. As your horses push on, it is as if they are wading through a thick green sea that swirls around your knees. You are little more than a mile from the hills when Quang signals everyone to halt. He has seen something suspicious and he points to it. You magnify your vision and scour the rain drenched grassland. Immediately, you spot three Chagarashi snaking their way through the foliage towards you. They are less than fifty yards away. Quang says it would be best to avoid them and you agree. He proposes that you circle around this area and attempt to enter the hills further south.</p>

<p>You twist the portal’s silver handle and, to your relief, you discover it is unlocked. You push it open and step across the threshold into a small chapel dedicated to Goddess Ishir. Standing before a wooden altar draped with a silver cloth stands a Priestess of the Moon, a devout acolyte of Ishir. She is clothed in a beautiful robe of shimmering white silk interwoven with threads of fine silver. She leaves the altar and walks towards you with her delicate hands crossed upon her chest.</p>
<p>‘I am Priestess Song Tao,’ she says, softly. ‘Welcome.’</p>
<p>You sense the aura of goodness that she exudes and it flows over you like a cool refreshing breeze (restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point). You introduce yourself and tell her that you are the Kai Grand Master whom Anseng had been sent to escort to Pensei. She asks after your guide and she is deeply saddened to hear what became of him. She closes her eyes and a single tear trickles down her pale cheek. Slowly, she opens her eyes and holds you with a mesmerizing stare. Your Sixth Sense tells you that she is looking into your mind. When she is sure that you are indeed a Kai Grand Master, she uncrosses her hands and beckons you to follow her.</p>

<p>You agree to Rakhi’s proposal and pay her 20 Gold Crowns from your belt pouch. You may record this Wardstone on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item that you wear around your neck, suspended by its gold chain. If you enter into combat against an undead adversary whilst in possession of this item, you may reduce your enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 3 for the duration of the fight.</p>
<p>Rakhi is delighted and she puts the Gold Crowns in her velvet satchel.</p>
<p>‘Thank you very much,’ she says. Then she leans across the table and kisses you fondly on the cheek. It is at this moment that Anseng arrives, having just completed his long conversation with the innkeeper.</p>
<p>‘I see you’ve found a new friend while I’ve been gone,’ he says, with a grin, ‘and I must admit, she’s a lot prettier than me.’</p>
<p>Rakhi giggles and bids you both goodnight. Clutching her velvet satchel, she leaves the table and Anseng sits himself opposite you. You ask him about his negotiations with the innkeeper and he nods his head wearily.</p>
<p>‘Lun-chow drives a hard bargain,’ he replies, ‘but we have ourselves two new horses. I had to pay him every Ren I possessed to get them. Don’t worry, my Lord. The Khea-khan is a generous man and he will recompense me once we reach Pensei.’</p>
<p>Anseng tells you that two rooms for the night were part of the bargain he struck with Lun-chow. He hands you a key and tells you that your room is number 5.</p>
<p>‘We have another long ride ahead of us tomorrow. Let’s get some rest, for we must leave at dawn if we are to reach Pensei by nightfall.’</p>

<p>Quang and the Watchers leave their locations and race to their horses. Rapidly, you mount your horse and spur him towards the open doors. You are halfway across the barn when two Chagarashi appear in the open doorway and throw their arms wide. They spread their sinewy fingers and their razor-sharp talons glint in the dull light. They are attempting to block your escape.</p>

<p>Your Arrow pierces the creature’s chest and makes it shriek loudly. It stumbles forward a few steps and then collapses face first into the mud, its heart skewered by the tip and shaft of your well-aimed missile.</p>
<p>‘Fine shooting, my Lord,’ says Anseng, settling himself down on the driver’s seat beside you, ‘Though I must say that this does not bode well for us. I’ve never known these creatures to venture this far south before. Something has made them come here, something more than a hunger for horseflesh.’</p>
<p>Your Sixth Sense warns you of an evil presence in the surrounding trees, an evil that is supernatural in nature, but you decide not to inform Anseng of your feelings for it will only disturb your brave guide unnecessarily. Once again you call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control to calm the wagon team. They are slow to respond to your soothing commands but your persistence pays off. When they have settled, you flick the reins, and the team sets off at a steady pace. Slowly they gather speed as their confidence returns.</p>
<p>You have covered less than a mile when you come to a sharp bend in the road. You rein in the horses to negotiate this difficult hairpin bend, but upon clearing it your heart sinks when you see a strange phenomenon blocking the highway. Barely fifty yards ahead, a semi-circular dome of swirling dark energy crackles and hisses as it brings the surface of the muddy road to the boil. Ghostly grey images swoop in and out of this dark dome, trailing wreathes of steam as they emerge from its unnatural blackness. Anseng can hardly believe what he is seeing. He opens his mouth to voice his shocked surprise but no sound emerges. His eyes widen with fear when he realises he can no longer speak.</p>

Its surface is deeply rutted, a consequence of the heavy wagons that travel this trade road every day. Approaching from the south you see a covered wagon drawn by four horses.

The blade is beautifully engraved and razor sharp. This distinctive weapon says much about Anseng’s distinguished military career. Only the Chai Imperial Guard are permitted to own and use such weapons, and only the bravest of their cadre are allowed to keep them when they retire from service. A thin strip of supple leather is fixed to either end of the <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i> so that Anseng can carry it slung over his shoulder when he is not on horseback.</p>

<p>You enter and ride along Tzushen Avenue. This thoroughfare is well lit and lined with leafy jougong trees that exude a fragrant scent, but you are immediately struck by the large number of shops and eating houses that are closed, their doors and windows boarded and shuttered. Halfway along the avenue are several consulates and embassies of foreign nations. Judging by their darkened windows and chained doors, they appear to have been shut down and abandoned by their diplomatic staff. You pass the abandoned Dessian Embassy which was administered by Lord Ghadra when you visited this city many years ago. The embassy was shut down in MS 5085 in protest of the Massacre of Yua Tzhan. Now only one consulate shows any signs of life. A column of grey smoke is rising from its chimney, its front door is unchained and there is candlelight radiating from one of its ground floor windows.

<p>You intone the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <i>Speed</i> and cast it on your flagging horse. Instantly, he responds with a dramatic surge of speed that carries you swiftly out of harm’s way. Soon you catch up to and overtake your companions, and they shake their heads in disbelief at how fast your horse is travelling. Anxious not to get too far ahead of Quang and the Watchers, you rein in your horse to a regular gallop and this is when you see something blocking the highway in the middle distance.</p>
<p>A score of Skarada are shambling along the highway towards you. They took cover in the tall grass when you and your companions rode along this section of the highway two hours ago, and now they are trying to rejoin the survivors of last night’s battle. You signal to the others to get off the highway and divert east across the open grassland, towards the western edge of the Tviloi Forest which is visible on the horizon. Quang and the Watchers skilfully shake off and outdistance most of the pursuing doomwolves and together you race towards the distant tree-line.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the forest you find that the pines are widely spaced and you are able to maintain your fast pace with relative ease. However, this sparse border also makes it easy for a determined handful of doomwolves to maintain their pursuit. The rumble of distant thunder and flashes of sheet lightning herald the return of heavy rain. This sudden change in the weather works to your advantage, dampening the scent of your horses and making it harder for the few remaining doomwolves to track you. At length you come to a denser part of the forest that forces your mounts to slow their pace. It is criss-crossed with several narrow but deep gullies. You work your way around these fissures until you arrive at one that is much longer than the others. It stretches across your path and, at first glance, there appears to be no way to traverse it.</p>
<p>‘Over there!’ shouts Quang, pointing along the gully towards the east. He has spotted a dead pine that has fallen across this narrow ravine. Its trunk spans the yawning gap and provides a natural bridge to the far side.</p>
<p>Quang takes the lead and you follow him in single file as he steers his horse safely across the fallen pine. When you reach the far side, you hear the ominous growl of a doomwolf close behind. The pack leader and three of its foul brood are in hot pursuit. They have already reached the middle of the tree bridge and will soon be upon you unless you can do something to halt their swift and determined advance.</p>

You go and settle yourself down on the comfortably padded bench seat and quietly observe Anseng and the innkeeper who are engaged in conversation at the end of the counter. A ripple of applause among the patrons draws your attention to a curtained archway in the far wall. The curtain is drawn aside and a troupe of entertainers files into the taproom, smiling with gratitude at the warm welcome they are receiving. They have performed for the patrons earlier this evening and now they return for their final performance of the night. As the applause dies down, the barmaid arrives at your table with a tray bearing a steaming bowl of rice and vegetables, mixed with a generous helping of diced lamb and chicken.

<p>The Skarada are less than thirty feet away when Lieutenant Quang shouts ‘Fire!’ As one, your companions release their straining bowstrings and send a volley of arrows whistling into the advancing enemy. The missiles all hit their mark and three of the four Skarada tumble forwards, mortally wounded. The lieutenant’s arrow penetrates the left shoulder of the leading Skarad and spins it around, but it does not make it lose its footing. Bellowing with pain, the creature hacks the protruding shaft in two with one blow of its flint axe. It snarls with anger and glares at you with its bloodshot amber eyes before it beats a hasty retreat into the trees.</p>
<p>You are determined not to let it escape. Hurriedly, you urge your horse forward in pursuit of the wounded beast. In less than a minute you run it to ground among the pines. Roaring like a cornered tiger, the Skarad swings around and leaps towards your horse with its axe raised high, slashing the air as it strikes. Terrified by its ferocity, your mount rears up and shies away from the creature’s manic attack. You are forced to cling to the pommel of your saddle with your left hand as you fight to prevent the snarling Skarad from hacking your horse to the ground.</p>

<p>You continue along the quayside. Your hopes of finding a boat and a boatman willing to take you across the estuary are fading fast until Quang spots something in the distance that raises your flagging spirit. It is a small brick built cabin with a roof of thick red tiles.</p>
<p>‘That’s the Coast Guard station,’ he says, and he marches towards it at a brisk pace. Inside you find the Quay Master seated at his desk. He is hunched over a detailed map of the Tkukoma Estuary with a mug of steaming jala cupped in his hands. Quang asks him if he has any Coast Guard boats operational in the estuary and the thin-faced Quay Master snorts with derision.</p>
<p>‘In this weather? Not likely!’</p>
<p>‘Then by the power vested in me by Khea-khan Lao Tin, I am commandeering one of your boats,’ replies Quang, officiously, and he shows the Quay Master his insignia of rank. The man looks at his insignia, then he looks at you and Deng and he bursts out laughing.</p>
<p>‘I am not joking,’ retorts Quang. ‘I demand you let me inspect your fleet.’</p>
<p>‘My fleet?’ replies the Quay Master, chuckling under his breath. ‘Very well, I’ll show you my fleet. Follow me.’</p>
<p>You leave the Coast Guard station and follow the Quay Master along the quayside to a small rowing boat tethered by a rope to an iron ring in the wall.</p>
<p>‘There, that’s my fleet. All that’s left of it that is. You’re welcome to commandeer it if you wish.’</p>
<p>The Quay Master turns on his heel and marches back to his station, laughing and shaking his head all the way. You look down at the rowing boat and your heart sinks. It is a sturdily built craft but there is only enough room for two. If the three of you were to attempt to cross the stormy estuary in this tiny boat it would surely capsize. Quang places his hand on Deng’s shoulder and the Watcher raises his head and looks unblinkingly into the Lieutenant’s steely eyes.</p>
<p>‘I am discharging you of your duties, Deng,’ he says. ‘You have served loyally and bravely and I will commend you to the Khea-khan. Return to the cavalry barracks and join with Bai. Accompany him on his ride back to Jueng tomorrow.’</p>
<p>Deng nods his head and salutes the Lieutenant. He wishes you both good luck before he leaves the quayside and walks away into the teeming rain. You watch him go. He does not look back.</p>
<p>‘It is best he goes with Bai tomorrow,’ says Quang. ‘If they should run into the enemy during their journey, they’ll stand a better chance of surviving than if Bai were to go alone.’</p>
<p>‘It will be hard on them to tell Shen-Yin that she has lost her husband,’ you reply.</p>
<p>‘Yes… yes it will,’ says Quang, his voice tinged with bitter sadness. ‘Her husband… and her sister too. When I spoke with Bai at the stables, he told me that when he searched the farm house next to the barn, he found the bodies of Shen-Yin’s sister and her husband. Both had been murdered by the Skarada.’</p>
<p>‘This is so sad,’ you reply, ‘I pray that Ishir will give her strength to bear her grievous loss.’</p>
<p>Quang walks to the edge of the quay and loosens the rope securing the rowboat.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps we should wait until the storm abates,’ you say.</p>
<p>‘There’s no chance of any improvement in this foul weather,’ replies Quang. ‘We could be waiting here for days.

<p>With trepidation, you continue along the trail. You reach a section of the muddy forest path that is wider and straighter, and here you see that the tracks have changed. They indicate that several new barefooted creatures have joined with the ones you have been following, and the hoof-prints of the horse are deeper and more numerous. From these tracks you deduce that a struggle occurred here. The hoof-prints continue along the trail, but they are wider spaced than before. This tells you that Anseng was able to break free from the creatures and escape at speed along the path beyond.</p>
<p>A gurgling growl makes you reach to your Kai Weapon and scan the surrounding trees. Several hulking grey shapes are closing in from both sides and your pulse quickens when you first catch sight of them. They resemble tall muscular humans, but these cadaverous creatures are neither human nor alive. Their scabrous hairless grey skins reek of a charnel smell that makes your stomach churn. Foul black fluid drips from their fanged mouths and a baleful green glow radiates from their ragged eye sockets. From the tip of index fingers of their right hands extend curved razor-sharp talons that glint in the subdued light of the forest. Your horse rears up in fright and you struggle to keep control of her as the creatures come leaping out from the trees with unnerving speed. These creatures are undead and you must fight them all as one enemy.</p>

You glance over your left shoulder and see a Kraan landing at the end of the pier. Astride its back is a Doomgah, but one that is larger and more muscular than the others. A breast plate of black iron encases its chest and in its hand it carries a large <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i>, an exaggerated mockery of the Chai Imperial Guard weapon. Your Magnakai Discipline of Divination informs you that this creature is Klüz, the Doomgah leader. It fixes you with a withering stare and its dull orange eyes flare brightly.

<p>Quang and the Watchers skilfully shake off and outdistance their pursuing doomwolves and together you plunge through the tree-line of the Tviloi Forest. At first the pines are widely spaced and you maintain your fast pace with relative ease. However, this sparse border also makes it easy for a determined handful of doomwolves to maintain their pursuit. The rumble of distant thunder and flashes of sheet lightning herald the return of heavy rain. This sudden change in the weather works to your advantage, dampening the scent of your horses and making it harder for the remaining doomwolves to track you. At length you come to a denser part of the forest that forces your mounts to slow their pace. It is criss-crossed with several narrow but deep gullies. You work your way around these fissures until you arrive at one that is much longer than the others. It stretches across your path and, at first glance, there appears to be no way to traverse it.</p>
<p>‘Over there!’ shouts Quang, pointing along the gully towards the east. He has spotted a dead pine that has fallen across this narrow ravine. Its trunk spans the yawning gap and provides a natural bridge to the far side.</p>
<p>Quang takes the lead and you follow him in single file as he steers his horse safely across the fallen pine. When you reach the far side, you hear the ominous growl of a doomwolf close behind. The pack leader and three of its foul brothers are in hot pursuit. They have already reached the middle of the tree bridge and will soon be upon you unless you can do something to halt their swift and determined advance.</p>

<p>Daruzhi Street leads to the quayside area of the city. Thunder rumbles all along the quay and the dark waters of the estuary roil and seethe, illuminated and tormented by jagged bolts of lightning. Scarlet flags are flying all along the quayside as a weather warning. It is forbidden to take a boat out when these flags are displayed. Most of the boats are securely moored and under canvas, save for a few foreign trading vessels that are berthed at a long stone pier. These are not under covers, but they are well secured with ropes and chains, their hatches battened down and their sails stowed away in lockers below deck.</p>

Quickly dismounting, you rush towards it with your Kai Weapon poised to strike if it shows the slightest sign of life. As soon as you are certain it is dead, you signal to your companions to come forward. There is something wrapped around the creature’s left wrist that catches your eye. It is a Gold Necklace, a trinket that the beast most likely stole from the body of a luckless refugee. On close examination you find that it is poorly plated gold and is of little monetary value.

<p>Quang and the Watchers rush to their horses. Rapidly, you mount your horse and spur him towards the open doors.

<p>The sergeant enters the blockhouse with two of his men and slams the door shut behind them. He orders them to take your Kai Weapon and bring it to him. He walks to the middle of the bare brick room and inspects it in the light of a solitary ceiling lantern.</p>
<p>‘You, go fetch the Captain,’ he says, curtly, to one of the guardsmen. Obediently the man leaves the blockhouse chamber to carry out the sergeant’s command.</p>
<p>A few minutes later he returns with a tall officer who is clad resplendently in his palace uniform. The sergeant shows him your Kai Weapon and he relaxes his stern expression.</p>
<p>‘Where is Anseng?’ he asks.</p>
<p>‘We were separated from one another during the ride to Pensei,’ you reply. ‘I don’t know for sure where he is, or even if he’s still alive.’</p>
<p>To the sergeant’s surprise, the officer returns your Kai Weapon and gives you a formal salute.</p>
<p>‘Stand down, Sergeant Jeou. You have carried out your duties well. Now I’ll take charge of this man. You and your men may return to your posts.’</p>
<p>The sergeant salutes his senior officer and, without any murmur of dissent, he signals to his men to leave the blockhouse. He follows as they file out of the chamber and pauses only to close the stout door behind him.</p>
<p>‘I’ve been briefed to expect you, but I’m sorry to hear that Anseng is missing. He’s a fine man, an exemplary guardsman. I pray to Ishir he’ll find his way here before the siege begins.’</p>
<p>Captain Voushan formally introduces himself and tells you what has happened in Pensei over the past few days.</p>
<p>‘An attack was launched upon Fort Jhung, two days ago, by Bhanarian forces and a horde of Agarashi commanded by the dark wizard they call Zashnor. It was destroyed in a blizzard of lightning and crumbled to the ground. None of the fort’s garrison is known to have survived. The destruction of Fort Jhung created a breach in the Chai Wall through which Zashnor’s army has poured like water through a broken dam. Yesterday at dawn, the enemy vanguard was first sighted on the west road. By dusk, they’d reached the city wall. All throughout today their numbers have grown greater as the bulk of Zashnor’s invasion force has arrived from the ruins of Fort Jhung. Many of our citizens have abandoned their homes and are heading south to take refuge in the towns of Valus and Hi’joi. I have deployed the guard and garrison of Pensei along the west wall. Only a small bodyguard remains here in the palace under my command. Lao Tin received word of your coming from three Watchers who arrived here yesterday from Dwala. I am privy to the Prince’s plans and I can assure you that the item you seek will be given to you gladly. Lao Tin is young but he is wise beyond his years. He believes that Zashnor craves that which you are determined to deny him, and he hopes the sorcerer will withdraw his forces from the city when he discovers that it is no longer here.’</p>
<p>Captain Voushan bids you follow him to the keep of the Imperial Palace where Prince Lao Tin resides. You leave the blockhouse in his company and cross a parade ground on your way to the doors of the keep. On one side of the parade ground, illuminated by a circle of guttering torches, two men in torn clothing kneel in the pouring rain with their heads bowed and their hands tied behind their backs. Behind them stand two Imperial Guardsmen at attention with their <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusamis</i> held diagonally across their chests.</p>

Momentarily, you are blinded and stunned by the raw power of the blast (lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points). As you struggle to recover, you sense that the ladder is swinging dangerously close to the tops of the surrounding toa trees. Below, you glimpse the light of Anseng’s lantern moving across the clearing as he chases after the loose trailing end of the rope ladder. Again the skyship is struck by lightning and this time it lists heavily to starboard. The ropes are wrenched from your grasp as the ladder whips towards the canopy of the trees, sending you tumbling and crashing through the dense canopy of toa fronds.</p>

His crippled yet functioning body is chilling testimony to the power of Nadziran Zashnor.</p>

<p>The moment you take the satchel from the Khea-khan’s hand, you feel a wave of nausea flow through your body that makes you shudder with revulsion. The bag contains the Eye of Agarash. For centuries this evil gem has lain dormant, its power inert. Now it has been awoken, triggered by the close proximity to you—a champion of God Kai. Hurriedly, you draw upon your Grand Master Discipline of Kai-screen to shield yourself from its malicious radiance. Your defences counter its insidious effect, but you suffer a minor shock to your nervous system that leaves you chilled to the bone: lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Whenever you are affected by the debilitating power of the Eye of Agarash, you may use Laumspur to help you recover. Normally, a healing potion of Laumspur restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when taken after combat. When using it to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> lost due to the power of the Eye of Agarash, you may only restore the actual number of points lost. For example, if you should lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points due to the effects of the Eye, and then you take a potion of Laumspur which normally restores 4 points, you will only regain the lost 3 points.

<p>Your final fatal blow shatters the chest of the Ice Dragon Zashnor. It implodes with a deafening noise, like the simultaneous smashing of a thousand crystal chandeliers. The frosty wings and limbs become detached as the torso disintegrates upon the deck, and rapidly they melt into a milky cloud that engulfs the broken remains. For a few moments this opaque ball of mist churns and seethes until it loses the last fragments of its energy and is whipped away on the winds of the storm.</p>
<p>The Imperial Zlanbeast circles above the deck of the <cite>Silver Virixe</cite>, cawing incessantly. When it detects that its master has been destroyed, it emits a despairing shriek before flying off in a westerly direction, across to the far side of the Tkukoma Estuary and beyond.</p>
<p>Lying at your feet is the grey robed form of Zashnor, torn and lifeless. You draw back the hood of its robe and reveal its true form. Its distorted goat-like skull is semi-transparent allowing you to see its brain which is as dark as night. Two small straight horns protrude from its forehead and its eye sockets appear unnaturally black, as if they are two holes through which you can see into another plain of existence. It is exceedingly rare to look upon a Nadziran in its true form. You recall something that Supreme Master Lone Wolf told you about the Nadziranim, that when they are destroyed they are destroyed utterly; nothing at all remains of their bodies or spirit. Zashnor was clearly an exceptional Nadziran. There are rumours that a select few Nadziranim have returned to Magnamund by the grace of Naar and by life-draining necromantic rituals after having seemingly been destroyed. Mindful of this, you resolve that Zashnor shall never join their ranks.</p>
<p>Driven by an overwhelming instinct, you raise your Kai Weapon above your head and bring it crashing down upon the Nadziran’s loathsome skull. Your mighty blow sunders the translucent bone case, destroying it completely. Within moments of its destruction, the crushed remains of the skull and the entire skeletal carcass become a pungent black slime that bubbles and boils until all that is left are a ragged grey robe and a man-sized patch of scorched decking.</p>
<p>The thunder and lightning cease abruptly and the violent storm begins to abate. The winds die down and the torrential rain recedes until it becomes little more than light drizzle. Calm is slowly returning to storm ravaged Chai as the power of Zashnor relinquishes its foul grip on nature. After so many days of raging turmoil, the natural balance of the elements is finally being restored.</p>
<p>You close your eyes and offer up a prayer to God Kai for giving you the strength and courage to overcome this formidable foe. You are concluding your prayer when a riotous noise makes you open your eyes and focus your gaze on the quayside.</p>

<p>Your room is facing you when you reach the top of the stairs. The door is unlocked and you enter to find that it is a well-appointed room with a comfortable bed and fine furnishings. You can hear the rain beating against the window pane and the sounds of jollity in the taproom below. You begin to wish you had stayed below with Anseng, but another long ride on the highway awaits you tomorrow and you are in need of a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>You wake at dawn to the sound of a cockerel crowing. It stopped raining during the night and sunlight is streaming through the room’s solitary window. You gather up your equipment and descend the stairs to the taproom. Anseng is waiting there and he greets you with a smile. Tzu approaches from the adjoining kitchen and Anseng offers to pay him for your rooms and food. Politely, the friendly owner refuses to accept his money and Anseng does not argue with his decision.</p>
<p>‘It’s the least I can do for you, my friend,’ says Tzu, ‘after all the help you have given me in the past. I wish you both a safe journey. I hope you’ll come visit us again before too long.’</p>

<p>You and Anseng sit at a table near to the tavern’s crackling log fire. Yeng Zhi brings you each a bowl of steamed rice, mixed with chopped vegetables and diced lamb. While you are eating this delicious food, the main door opens and in comes an old man clad in a flamboyantly embroidered blue overcoat. The patrons greet him with applause and he acknowledges them with a jovial smile and a bow of respect.</p>
<p>‘Ah, it’s Shou Len,’ says Anseng. ‘It looks like we’re in for a treat this evening!’</p>
<p>Tzu warmly welcomes the old man. He helps him off with his rain-sodden coat and hat and hangs them on a hook behind the taproom counter.</p>
<p>‘Shou Len is a Riddler,’ says Anseng. ‘He’s well known in these parts. I wonder what riddles he has in store for us tonight.’</p>
<p>Tzu escorts Shou Len to a table next to yours and turns to his patrons and says: ‘Place your wagers, my friends. Let’s see who among us have the wit and wisdom to win tonight!’</p>
<p>The taproom patrons place varying amounts of Ren (the currency of Chai) into folds of paper and inscribe their names upon them. Then they come forward and place their sealed bets on Shou Len’s table. If you would like to wager on the first riddle that the old man is going to pose, you should now decide how many Gold Crowns you wish to bet and deduct them from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Anseng passes you a piece of paper in which to wrap your wager, and he hands you a stick of charcoal with which you can inscribe your name. Sommlending Gold Crowns are readily accepted in Chai (1 Gold Crown = 10 Ren). Anseng decides to wager 20 Ren. You are obliged to make a minimum bet of 1 Gold Crown.</p>
<p>Once all the bets are in, Shou Len clears his throat and calls out his first riddle.</p>
<p>‘Xian Tzee is 54 years old. Yisu, her mother, is 80 years old. How many years ago was Yisu exactly three times the age of her daughter?’</p>
<p>Tzu has a large hourglass on the taproom counter. The moment Shou Len has finished posing the riddle, he turns the hourglass over and its sand begins to trickle from the upper part into the lower part of the glass.

Gradually, you recover enough strength and vision to struggle wearily to your feet and survey your surroundings. You have come ashore a mile south of Dwala.

<p>An elegant Palace courtier takes you gently by the arm and escorts you to your sleeping room on the ground floor. Upon arriving, she opens the mahogany door, bows politely, and motions you to enter. You cross the threshold and stare in amazement at this luxurious bedchamber. The courtier bids you good night and the door closes behind her without a sound.</p>
<p>Fine food and new clothing have thoughtfully been provided for you. You climb out of your damp and travel-stained clothes and ease yourself into the warm water of a sunken marble bath. The scented water soothes your aching limbs. After bathing, you eat before retiring to a majestic bed where you fall asleep as soon as your head touches the soft silk pillow.</p>
<p>You are awoken before dawn by the harmonic tinkling of a small hand bell. You open your eyes and the first thing you see is the smiling face of the courtier. With a soft and lilting voice, she tells you that Lieutenant Quang will be in the concourse in thirty minutes time. You watch as she seemingly glides out of the bed chamber and closes the door. You arise feeling better than you have felt in days. A good night’s rest and a generous helping of shameless luxuriance restore any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you may have lost so far. You get dressed in your new clothes which comprise a crimson leather jacket, black breeches, sturdy black boots, and a dark green oilskin cape with a generous hood. After re-equipping yourself with your belt, Backpack, and Weapons, you leave the bedchamber and make your way to the concourse. The three Watchers are there and they bid you good morning. You have all arrived a little early and you have ten minutes to kill before Lieutenant Quang is expected. The palace courtiers bring you each a basket of freshly baked bread, cheese, and slices of veal with exotic fruits and together you eat a hurried breakfast beside the azure stream of the indoor garden before Quang arrives.</p>
<p>The lieutenant appears, clad in his battle dress with his badge of rank prominently displayed on his dark green cloak. He ushers you all to the Imperial stables where you collect your mounts for the journey. They are fine steeds and will serve you well. You pass through the city’s south gate just as dawn is breaking and begin the long ride to Vabou. The rain swept highway is still crowded with refugees but they quickly make way for you when they recognise Quang’s Imperial Guard insignia and you reach the village of Uzam in the early afternoon. You pass by the blacksmithy and general store and notice that both places are now closed and boarded up.

<p>Shousun hurries away to prepare your food and you try to relax after the rigours of your long ride. The greenish ale helps. It is called Chai-cheer and it is a brew famous throughout Magnamund. It is deliciously malty and wonderfully refreshing. Quang tells you that he chose his words carefully when speaking to the innkeeper. To have said nothing would have stoked his fears and caused unnecessary anxiety among the villagers. He is in no doubt that Shousun will not keep what he has been told to himself for very long.</p>
<p>Soon the innkeeper returns with your meals, four plates stacked high with slices of grilled pork and copious roasted potatoes. He places the food on the table and hands you each a key to your rooms on the floor above. You eat your food in silence and then retire, thankful to be out of the rain and in warm comfortable beds on this bleak and stormy night.</p>
<p>You fall asleep with ease but you do not rest easily. You are haunted by dreams filled with sinister shadowy images and premonitions of impending loss. Thrice you awaken during the night, drenched in cold sweat, and each time you do you find it hard to go back to sleep. When you wake a fourth time, an hour before dawn, you decide to leave your bed and sit by the window to await the coming light of day. Due to your poor night’s sleep and the chilling nightmares you have suffered, you lose 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Quang, Bai, and Deng are waiting for you when you descend the stairs to the taproom below. Shousun’s daughter, Zhou-yin, has brought your horses from the stable and they are tethered to a rail outside the front door of the inn. She has prepared some food to take with you. It is wrapped in four neat parcels of toa leaves and secured with twine. (If you wish to accept your food parcel, record it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Meal). You bid her thanks and tell her to convey your appreciation to her father when he awakens.</p>
<p>Chao is in the market square when you arrive there, seated astride his horse. There is no need to ask him if he enjoyed his visit home; the smile on his face says it all. Quang tells you that it is a thirty mile ride from here to Valus and he wants to reach the town by late afternoon. The Watchers nod in agreement and together you set off along the highway heading east.</p>

The interior of this dwelling shows signs of having been abandoned in a hurry. The embers of a log fire are still aglow in its stone fireplace, and the remnants of a hastily eaten meal remain on the table. You draw up a chair and seat yourself at the table, making sure you have a clear view through the open doorway to the hills beyond.</p>
<p>The Watchers seat themselves around the table and rest their weary heads in their hands. Quang remains standing nearby. Bai, Chao and Deng are close to tears.

<p>As you approach the covered wagon, you see that it has shed one of its two rear wheels. The Chai wagoneer, clad in a hooded grey oilskin, is struggling to get the wheel back onto the axle but the thick mud and relentless rain confound his every attempt.</p>
<p>‘I know this man,’ says Anseng, and calls out to the luckless traveller. ‘Hail, Chengu!’</p>
<p>The wagoneer turns his head and peers at you both through the teeming rain.</p>
<p>‘Anseng? Is that you? Ishir be praised, it is you!’</p>
<p>‘Chengu, my dear friend, you picked a fine time to go to market!’</p>
<p>You bring your horse to a halt behind the wagon, dismount, and tether its reins to the tailboard. Anseng makes a cursory inspection of the damaged axle and then introduces you to his friend. You learn that Chengu is a rice farmer. He and Anseng have known each other since they were young boys. They were both born and raised in the same street in the city of Dwala. When they were young men they went their separate ways; Anseng enlisted in the Chai Army and Chengu became a farmer in this region. Anseng always made sure to visit Chengu at his farmstead when the army dispatched him to H’lau once a year.</p>
<p>The wagon is laden with sacks of rice and the weight of this cargo has made it impossible for Chengu to reattach the wheel. But with Anseng’s assistance, you are able to raise the rear of the wagon just enough for Chengu to push the wheel back into position. Its retaining pin has sheared off and so you improvise a replacement from an iron bracing scavenged from the tailgate. Within the hour, the wagon is good to continue its journey to Vabou. Anseng sits himself beside his friend, and you travel alongside the wagon on horseback. You have covered barely a mile when a cawing sound draws your gaze skyward. A trio of coal-black ravens are circling directly overhead.</p>

<p>Your final fatal blow shatters the chest of the Ice Dragon Zashnor. It implodes with a deafening noise, like the simultaneous smashing of a thousand crystal chandeliers. The frosty wings and limbs become detached as the torso disintegrates upon the deck, and rapidly they melt into a milky cloud that engulfs the broken remains. For a few moments this opaque ball of mist churns and seethes until it loses the last of its energy and is whipped away on the winds of the storm.</p>
<p>Lying at your feet is the grey robed form of Zashnor, torn and lifeless. You draw back the hood of its robe and reveal its true form. Its distorted goat-like skull is semi-transparent allowing you to see its brain which is as dark as night. Two small straight horns protrude from its forehead and its eye sockets appear unnaturally black, as if they are two holes through which you can see into another plain of existence. It is exceedingly rare to look upon a Nadziran in its true form. You recall something that Supreme Master Lone Wolf told you about the Nadziranim, that when they are destroyed they are destroyed utterly; nothing at all remains of their bodies or spirit. Zashnor was clearly an exceptional Nadziran. There are rumours that a select few Nadziranim have returned to Magnamund by the grace of Naar and life-draining necromantic rituals after having seemingly been destroyed. Mindful of this, you resolve that Zashnor shall never join their ranks.</p>
<p>Driven by an overwhelming instinct, you raise your Kai Weapon above your head and bring it crashing down upon the Nadziran’s loathsome skull. Your mighty blow sunders the translucent bone case, destroying it completely. Within moments of its destruction, the crushed remains of the skull and the entire skeletal carcass become a pungent black slime that bubbles and boils until all that is left are a ragged grey robe and a man-sized patch of scorched decking.</p>
<p>The thunder and lightning cease abruptly and the violent storm begins to abate. The winds die down and the torrential rain recedes until it becomes little more than light drizzle. Calm is slowly returning to storm ravaged Chai as the power of Zashnor relinquishes its foul grip on nature. After so many days of raging turmoil, the natural balance of the elements is finally being restored.</p>
<p>You close your eyes and offer up a prayer to God Kai for giving you the strength and courage to overcome this formidable foe. You are concluding your prayer when a riotous noise makes you open your eyes and focus your gaze on the quayside.</p>

<p>Your swift dispatch of the larger Chagarashi causes its lesser companion to flee in panic. As it lopes away into the trees, Anseng appears by your side. With a wry smile, he says:</p>
<p>‘Well, my Lord. It appears you didn’t need my help in dealing with these accursed beasts.’</p>
<p>‘Not this time,’ you reply. ‘But your help’s always welcome. I may not be so fortunate next time.’</p>
<p>Once again you call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control to calm the wagon team. They are slow to respond to your soothing commands but your persistence pays off. When they have settled, you join Anseng on the driver’s seat and take up the reins. The horses set off at a steady pace and slowly gather speed as their confidence returns.</p>
<p>You have covered less than a mile when you come to a sharp bend in the road. You rein in the horses to negotiate this difficult hairpin bend, but upon clearing it your heart sinks when you see a strange phenomenon blocking the highway. Barely fifty yards ahead, a semi-circular dome of swirling dark energy crackles loudly as it brings the surface of the muddy road to the boil. Ghostly grey images swoop in and out of this dark dome, trailing wreathes of steam as they emerge from its unnatural blackness. Anseng can hardly believe what he is seeing. He opens his mouth to voice his shocked surprise but no sound emerges. His eyes widen with fear when he realises he can no longer speak.</p>

<p>You steer your horse onto the crowded highway and draw up alongside a covered wagon that shields you from the eyes of the approaching Chai rangers, but your actions do not go unnoticed. The rangers turn their horses onto the highway, scattering refugees as they force their way through. It will take more than your Magnakai Discipline of Invisibility to keep you and your horse hidden from these elite cavalrymen. Inexorably, they draw closer and you are forced to abandon your attempt to hide beside the wagon which no longer provides any cover from the approaching rangers.</p>
<p>You leave the wagon and force your way through the refugees. The moment you are off the highway, you urge your mare to the gallop and head due west towards a range of low hills. They will provide you with good cover in which to shake off the Chai cavalrymen who are now pursuing you across rain-swept grassland.</p>
<p>The rangers give up the chase as soon as you enter the hills. Reluctantly, they turn their horses around and ride back to the highway.

<p>Upon the instant you defeat the Spectral Entity, its ghostly body and the dome of dark energy both vanish in the blink of an eye. Anseng regains his ability to speak, but the shock of the supernatural encounter leaves him agitated and wary. You sense that the presence of evil that has haunted you since entering this hilly and wooded area has now gone. Tranquillity has returned to this region. Anseng and the horse team are reassured by this welcome return to normality and you resume your journey to Vabou with all haste.</p>
<p>Night falls long before you reach the town. The way ahead is illuminated by bright moonlight that pours through a break in the leaden clouds and is reflected in the puddles that cover the waterlogged highway. You offer up a silent prayer of thanks to Goddess Ishir for this blessing she has bestowed upon you and your companions, for it enables the horse team to follow the highway across the Huzang Plain with little difficulty.</p>
<p>It is an hour before midnight when you see the lights of Vabou in the middle distance. This large town is surrounded by a wooden palisade, lending it a fort-like appearance. Upon reaching the town’s west gate, you are waved down by two town guardsmen with glowing lanterns. They recognise the <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i> that Anseng is armed with and respectfully they salute him. They are aware that only the Imperial Guard are permitted to own and use such weapons, and only the most distinguished former-members of the Guard are allowed to retain their coveted polearm when they retire from service. Beyond the west gate, you trundle along a wide shop-lined street that leads to a junction where it joins the main highway connecting the town of Klatii with the capital, Pensei. During your night journey to Vabou, Chengu has fully recovered from the shock of his ordeal and has resumed his role as wagoneer. Anseng directs him along the central highway to a large inn called The Golden Dragon. It is here that you bid farewell to Chengu and climb down from his wagon. He wishes you both good luck and farewell before he sets off for the house of his brother and family on the east side of the town.</p>
<p>Despite the late hour, the Golden Dragon is still open for business. The rains have returned and Anseng beckons you to follow as he climbs the wide stone steps from the street to the inn’s front door.</p>

<p>Hurriedly you let loose your Arrow but it misses its mark. It clips the doomwolf’s left ear and leaves a ragged tear that enrages the beast even more. It reaches the end of the trunk, leaps over your companions, and comes bounding directly towards you and your horse. You quickly shoulder your Bow and draw your Kai Weapon, but the instant it leaves the scabbard you are hit by this snarling Darklands beast. The force of the impact carries you clean out of your saddle. You land heavily on your back and gash your head on a jagged rock: lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small>.</p>

<p>You magnify your vision and focus on the bloodthirsty beasts responsible that are for this slaughter. The creatures are muscular bipeds covered with coarse grey fur. A bony ridge runs from their foreheads to the base of their stunted tails and each has a mouth filled with tiger-like fangs. Some have crude axes fashioned from flint and bone with which they brutally decapitate and dismember the corpses.</p>
<p>‘Skarada!’ gasps Quang, in disbelief. ‘I encountered a Skarad years ago in the Voxai Swamp. I still carry the scars of that accursed creature.’</p>
<p>Bai and Deng are so shocked and outraged when they survey this terrible scene that they cannot suppress their anger. Vehemently, they curse the murdering bloodthirsty beasts. Lieutenant Quang hisses at them to be quiet but their curses have already reached the ears of the closest Skarada. One of them emits a piercing shriek and a dozen of its confederates respond instantly. They cease their gruesome feasting and come bounding up the slope of the hill towards your position.</p>

Blinding blue-white forks of lightning streak from the black clouds above and stab the tortured waters all around. It is impossible to steer; all you can do is row hard and pray you will survive this terrifying voyage.</p>

The discharge of its electrical energy jolts and numbs your aching arms: lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point. Quang is worse affected and he loses a grip of his oar. It is torn from his grasp and whisked away on the howling wind. Shock has rendered him unconscious and turned his skin pale grey.

<p>The instant you slay Anseng, his cadaverous body is consumed by a ball of guttering blue flames. Hungrily they feed on his remains and the ball becomes larger, forcing you to retreat from its expanding power for fear of being drawn into the raging core. Abruptly, the ball transforms into a column of intense blue light that rapidly ascends into the storm clouds overhead. And then it is gone, leaving behind a heap of cold ashes on the muddy ground. Lying atop this mound is Anseng’s <i xml:lang="x-chaian">Kirusami</i>. It is no longer wreathed with blue fire; it appears to have returned to its normal state.</p>

<p>You soon discover a muddy footpath that wends its way through an acre of reed beds. The loud nocturnal croaking of Chai frogs can just be heard above noise of the howling wind. On the far side of the reed beds you come to a small shack perched on wooden stilts. Candlelight illuminates its solitary window. The door of the shack creaks open as you approach and you see an old man silhouetted in the doorway. He gives a friendly wave and beckons you to climb the ladder to his humble home.</p>
<p>He kindly offers to you shelter you from the storm, but you tell him you are on your way to Dwala and must press on.</p>
<p>‘You no reach city that way,’ he says. ‘Path flooded not far from here. You go east, join highway instead. That best way to Dwala.’ You thank the old man for his advice. As you are about to set off across the waterlogged grassland, he calls out:</p>
<p>‘You want buy Laumspur?’ he asks. ‘I got Laumspur. You look like you need Laumspur!’</p>
<p>This old Chai Wet-lander has three potions of Laumspur which he is willing to sell for 60 Ren (6 Gold Crowns) per potion. Each potion takes up one space in your backpack and restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> when swallowed after combat.</p>

<p>You ride ten miles through the gentle hills before turning east and heading back across the open grassland to the highway. You rejoin it near a place where a large group of refugees are assembled around a stone shrine dedicated to Goddess Ishir. They are kneeling in communal prayer, oblivious to the mud and the teeming rain. Your Sixth Sense detects an invisible aura of goodness surrounding the shrine. You bring your horse to a halt at the edge of the circle of devout worshippers and you feel a sensation of warmth and calmness flowing through you: restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Your horse also benefits from the reviving power of the shrine, and when you push on along the margin of grassland bordering the highway, she is able to maintain a steady canter without tiring.</p>
<p>Pensei appears in view shortly before dusk. A night curfew has been imposed and you arrive at the south gate of the city just in time to enter before the heavy portal is chained shut until dawn tomorrow. You meet with no challenge from the guards at the gate; they are too busy dealing with a last rush of refugees who are desperate to leave Pensei before the gate is locked and the curfew begins.</p>
<p>Inside the south gate there is a large square ringed by shops and dwellings. You must make your way to the Imperial Palace, but it has been a long time since you last set foot in this ancient capital and you are not sure which avenue will lead you there.

<p>Lord Honos is holding something when he returns to the chamber. Inquisitively, you all gather around him. Cupped in his hands is an apple-sized crystal with a milky opalescence. You sense it has magical properties. He brings the stone to his chest and presses it close to his heart. With his eyes firmly closed, he makes silent mental contact with the High Council in Elzian. A minute passes before he opens his eyes and says:</p>
<p>‘It is done. Now we must await their answer.’</p>
<p>There is a knock on the chamber door, and Song Tao says ‘Enter.’ The door opens and into the chamber come two Moon Maidens, devoted assistants to the Priestess. Their names are Kwe and Jia Zhai. They are bearing two silver platters of food and Priestess Song Tao invites you all to partake of this delicious selection of grilled fish, boiled rice, and steamed vegetables. You are eating when Lord Honos suddenly jumps up from his chair as if he has been stung by a bee.</p>

<p>The girl frowns and goes to have a quiet word with Lun-chow the Innkeeper. You see him nodding his approval and the girl comes back and informs you that there will be no charge for the meal; it is on the house.</p>
<p>From snippets of conversation you overhear while you are eating your delicious food, you learn that the entertainers are a band of travelling troubadours who hail from the city of Durwan in Lissan. They are on their way back to their native city after having performed in several taverns and inns of Pensei. The musicians begin to play a lively tune and a trio of pretty dancing girls whirl and twirl around the taproom to the delight of the patrons. One of the girls is wearing a tight-fitting red silk dress, and she glances repeatedly in your direction as she gyrates around the room. It appears that she has taken a special interest in you.</p>
<p>When the performance comes to a close, the patrons give a loud cheer and the girls pass among them collecting donations of Ren from the appreciative audience. After the money has been gathered up, the troubadours thank the Chai for their generosity and leave the taproom by way of the curtained archway. A few minutes later, the girl in the red silk dress reappears. With a charming smile, she comes and sits opposite you at your table. She tells you her name is Rakhi and says she has never seen anyone quite like you before. She asks if you are a Northlander. Your senses detect that she is genuinely friendly and does not intend to do you any harm. You reply that you are indeed a Northlander, but you refrain from telling her exactly which realm of the Northlands you hail from. ‘I thought so,’ she beams, joyfully. ‘I have something that may be of interest to you.’</p>
<p>She places a velvet satchel on the table and flips it open. It contains four ceramic phials, each one stoppered with a cork and carefully labelled and priced. She invites you to inspect them and gives an assurance that they are all genuine potions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laumspur (will restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when swallowed after combat): 50 Ren / 5 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Tazheng (a powerful anti-venom): 60 Ren / 6 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Tincture of Sabito root (rare in this part of Magnamund, Sabito enables the human body to extract oxygen from water through the skin, thus permitting anyone who swallows it to ‘breathe’ underwater): 80 Ren / 8 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Karmo: 120 Ren (12 Gold Crowns). When taken before combat, this potion doubles your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score for the duration of the combat. It has heavy side effects that sometimes can result in death. After consuming Karmo, you must pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. The number you choose determines how many <small>ENDURANCE</small> points you lose as a consequence of the side effects (0 = zero).</li>

<p>You draw your Kai Weapon and rush towards Zashnor as it struggles to pluck the Claw off the swaying deck. It grasps it unsteadily between two of its talons and fires off another bolt of energy in your direction. It is hurriedly cast and poorly aimed. The bolt shoots close by your left hip, melting the frost on the satchel containing the Eye as it crackles past and discharges harmlessly in the stormy waters of the estuary. You have avoided being hit directly, but the Eye is activated by the power of the Claw and it drains you of 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>Courageously, you strike the taloned hand of the Ice Dragon and send the Claw skittering away across the deck, beyond Zashnor’s reach. The fell dragon shrieks with rage. You resolve to exploit Zashnor’s unfocused burst of anger and slay this evil adversary where it stands.</p>

Frequent bolts of lightning illuminate the muddy highway as you trudge the final mile to Dwala’s south gate.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the gate, a guard steps from his sentry post and demands you pay the night toll.

<p>You collect your horses from the tavern’s stable and you are pleased to see that Tzu’s son, Jeng, has done a fine job of looking after them. They have been fed, watered, groomed and are both well rested. Anseng tips the boy 20 Ren and he beams with joyful appreciation. He wishes you both a safe journey as you mount up and begin your long ride to the town of Vabou.</p>
<p>The weather is fine and sunny as you make a gradual decent through the hills beyond the village of Zang. But by the time you reach the Huzang Plain, heavy cloud has moved in from the west. It brings with it more rain. Anseng peers out from beneath the dripping rim of his straw hat and casts a sceptical eye across the great expanse of lush grassland to the east of the muddy highway.</p>
<p>‘We’ll be lucky to reach Vabou by nightfall,’ he says, pessimistically. ‘But try we must.’</p>
<p>You ride all morning in the heavy rain. The highway has been reduced to a muddy morass in places, but your horses are sure footed and you make good progress despite the foul weather. Several of the farmsteads that you pass along the way are busily preparing for the coming storms that hit H’lau overnight. Farmers are hurriedly securing loose roof shingles and boarding up their windows. A few have decided to abandon their farms until the storms have passed. They are loading their wagons and preparing to abandon their homes to seek shelter with relatives in Zang and Vabou until it is safe to return.</p>
<p>It is mid-afternoon when you come to a small spire of stone at side of the highway, close to a wooded copse. Its metallic tip gleams dully in the poor light. Anseng says you should stop here for a short while to allow the horses to rest. You may now eat a Meal from your Backpack, or you can use your basic Kai Hunting Discipline to forage enough food for one Meal in the rice fields hereabouts. You are getting ready to remount and continue when a lightning storm breaks directly overhead. A crackling bolt of lightning strikes the tip of the stone spire, followed almost immediately by a deafening crash of thunder. The muddy ground shudders, but it is not the storm that is causing the sodden earth to tremble. From out of the copse comes a stampeding herd of Wild Guanza! These large bipedal lizards are wide-eyed with terror as they come racing towards you. Anseng screams a warning but the crazed Guanza pack are upon you before you can turn your horses about and evade them.</p>

<p>You consider both suggestions and realise it is time you must face the harsh reality of your situation; you have no chance of reaching the rendezvous point in time. It is difficult having to admit this to yourself, and even more difficult having to inform your brave companions that you cannot go any further westwards. The risks of being captured or killed are simply too great.</p>
<p>They accept your decision in silence, their faces taut with frustration and disappointment. Having endured so much hardship and danger since leaving Pensei, they are loath to give up now. Chao is the first to speak.</p>
<p>‘My Lord, though it saddens me to have failed to carry out my duty to escort you to your destination, there may be another way to see you safely home. I propose we turn to the south-east and enter the Tviloi Forest. It will provide us with good cover from the enemy. My home village is Jueng and I know the forest well. We could ride to Jueng and stay there overnight. I can assure you all of a warm welcome there.’</p>
<p>Lieutenant Quang turns his sullen head and stares at Chao.</p>
<p>‘And what then? Do you have a plan that will deliver the Grand Master home safely, or do you simply long to return to your own home and to Naar with the vow you made to our Khea-khan?’</p>
<p>Chao begs the Lieutenant’s forgiveness and asks to be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>‘Sir, with respect, I will never willingly break my vow. We will stay but one night in Jueng before continuing onward to Valus. The town has a ferry that crosses the Tkukoma Estuary twice daily. I propose we catch the ferry to Dwala. My comrade Watchers and I are based in Dwala. Our headquarters are in the Tower of Ishir. We are in regular contact with Lord Rimoah’s envoy. Through him we could get word to the Elder Magi that the Grand Master is with us and they could direct Lord Rimoah to collect him there.’</p>
<p>Lieutenant Quang considers Chao’s proposal and his stern expression softens.</p>
<p>‘My apologies, Chao. I should not have been so sharp with you. It is a good plan. I approve of it. What say you, Bai and Deng?’</p>
<p>The other Watchers are heartened by Chao’s proposal. It offers them the chance to keep the solemn vow they made to Lao Tin. Deng is especially pleased for his home and family are in Valus and it raises his hopes of seeing them again.</p>
<p>‘So be it,’ says Quang. ‘We shall turn towards the Tviloi Forest and make our way to Dwala from there.’</p>
<p>You are relieved that your mission may yet be completed and you agree to Chao’s plan of action. But your sense of relief rapidly evaporates when you look towards the distant enemy. While you have been listening intently to Chao, you have failed to notice that several dark shapes are loping across the open plain towards you. Swiftly you magnify your vision and your heart skips a beat. At once you recognise the approaching creatures and you can hardly believe what you see: doomwolves!</p>

<p>Your return sky voyage to the Kai Monastery of Lorn takes a little over six hours. During your aerial flight, Lord Rimoah asks many questions about your mission and he prepares a detailed account which he will give to Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf. Blazer has already given a similar report about his mission to the Kraknalorg chasm. He is proud to tell you that he, too, was successful.</p>
<p>You arrive at the Monastery in the early evening and watch the descent to the parade ground from the stern deck of the <cite>Comet</cite>. The blessed tranquillity of the Monastery is a welcome relief after the days and nights you have spent in the heavy rains and thunderous storms of Chai. You see <cite>Skyfort</cite> moored on the parade ground below and you hope that Black Hawk, Star Lynx, Steel Hand, and Swift Sword have enjoyed the same success that you and Blazer have achieved.</p>
<p>A Kai honour guard awaits you when you descend the boarding ladder to the gravelled parade ground. With pride, you acknowledge their salutes and accompany Lord Rimoah and Blazer to the Grand Hall at the top of the Tower of the Moon. Upon entering the hall, you see Lone Wolf seated upon his alabaster throne with Star Lynx and Sage Chastan standing quietly on either side.</p>
<p>‘Welcome Grand Masters,’ says Lone Wolf, proudly, ‘I commend you both on achieving your missions with honour. You have each defeated a powerful champion of evil and removed the threat they posed to the peace and stability of the lands around their mustering points. You have done well and you should feel rightly proud to have upheld the highest traditions of the Order.’</p>
<p>Sage Chastan approaches you and requests that you give him the Eye of Agarash. Lone Wolf nods his approval and willingly you hand over the satchel containing the bane that has burdened you all the way from Pensei. Chastan thanks you and bows respectfully to Lone Wolf and the others before leaving the Grand Hall. Lone Wolf gets up and steps away from his throne. He beckons you all to join him at his map table where he picks up the steel pointer and taps it on the Kraknalorg Chasm and the Doomlands of Naaros. He looks at you and Blazer and says:</p>
<p>‘The success of your missions have neutralised these threats.’ He then moves the pointer to Dessi and continues. ‘Grand Master Star Lynx achieved his mission here. He, too, is commended for his bravery and his success.’ Star Lynx bows in acknowledgement of Lone Wolf’s generous praise and tries hard to suppress a smile and maintain his composure.</p>
<p>‘And with the valuable assistance of our ally, Wizard Regent Grey Star, the city of Shadaki has been cleansed of the dark scourge that took control of it 16 years ago and lately threatened to resurrect the former Shadakine Empire in all its evil glory. At last, the death of Bright Star has been avenged. Ulonga and his Kitaezi Shamans are no more.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf taps the location of Shadaki and then he pauses. For several seconds he says nothing and your Sixth Sense tells you that all is not well. Slowly, he moves the pointer and taps the map in three other places: Cragmantle, Ljuk, and the Maakengorge.</p>
<p>‘Alas, I must inform you that not all of the missions have been a success. Black Hawk has not returned from the ruins of Cragmantle. Neither has Swift Sword from Ljuk. I sense that they did not survive the tasks I set them and my heart is heavy with their loss. They were both gifted Grand Masters and our Order is poorer for having lost them.’</p>
<p>A shadow of sadness darkens the Grand Hall and you feel the grief that you all now share upon hearing this regrettable news. Lone Wolf moves the pointer one last time and taps the Maakengorge.</p>
<p>‘This is where I dispatched Steel Hand to carry out his mission. He has not returned but I sense he is still alive. Guildmaster Banedon has gone back to Sommerlund to muster the help of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. They will assist a rescue mission to find and return Grand Master Steel Hand to us.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf puts down the pointer and moves his head in a slow arc around the table, pausing to look each of you in the eyes for a few moments before moving on.</p>
<p>‘Grand Masters, we must discover the fates that befell Black Hawk and Swift Sword. We must rescue Steel Hand, and we must complete the missions that I set them. Your accomplishments have delayed the resurgence of evil from overwhelming the Freelands of Magnamund, but this evil is growing stronger every day, every week, every month that we fail to defeat it. We must strive again to stem this rising flood before it becomes too strong for us to counter.’</p>
<p>Lone Wolf returns to his throne and motions to Lord Rimoah to come forward. They exchange a few quiet words and then Lone Wolf addresses you for the last time this day.</p>
<p>‘Retire to your quarters and rest well, my Lords. I shall summon each of you tomorrow morning. Lord Rimoah and I shall decide the locations you shall be sent to complete the missions that remain unaccomplished.’</p>
<p>You leave the Grand Hall with Blazer and Star Lynx and retire to your private chamber. The loss of your brother Grand Masters is a bitter blow, but you try to put your grief to the back of your mind and concentrate on the mission that awaits you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. You have achieved a great victory over the forces of darkness and saved Chai from certain destruction at the hands of Nadziran Zashnor and his fell minions. Soon your new mission will be revealed. You will discover the nature of the task that awaits you in the next exciting New Order adventure entitled:</p>

<h2><a name="map">Map of the Khea-Khanate of Chai</a></h2>


<p>The Khea-khanate of Chai is a land whose north-east is dominated by flat expanses of grassy plains, while the southern coast consists largely of forests and rolling hills. Two small mountain ranges, the Huzang and the Szuchow, are located slightly west of the country’s centre and are separated by jungles which slowly give way to swamps as one moves further west.</p>
<p>The city of Vabou is located near Chai’s centre, and a traveller leaving Vabou would be able to choose between three of Chai’s principal roadways in order to continue their journey. Choosing the south-west road would take the traveller towards the Chai Sea and the coastal town of H’lau, with a jungle bordering the road to the north and the Huzang Mountains and its foothills to the south.</p>
<p>If, instead, the traveller chose the south-east road, they would find themselves passing between the grasslands of the Chai Plain to their north and the Tviloi Forest to their south, with the road forking at the town of Klatii. One fork bears generally eastwards towards the river town of Hi’joi, while the other turns further southwards through the Tviloi forest, passing through Jueng and ending at the town of Valus, which is separated from the great city of Dwala by the waters of the Tkukoma Estuary.</p>
<p>Finally, the traveller leaving Vabou might choose the road bearing north, and after a journey flanked by the Nagah Forest to the east and Szuchow Mountains to the west, would arrive at Pensei, the capital of Chai and home of the Khea-khan himself. The capital is protected from the incursions of Chai’s often unfriendly Bhanarian neighbours by the Chai Wall, a huge construction located a dozen miles to the west of Pensei, running about 50 miles from north to south, and anchored by several forts, notably Fort Jhung which stands athwart the road running west from Pensei into the nation of Bhanar.</p>

<h4><a name="lic-1-5">1.5</a></h4>

<p>‘Licensee’ shall hereafter refer to any person or electronic agent who receives some portion or all of the Internet Editions. The ‘Licensee’ shall hereinafter be referred to as ‘Licensee’ or ‘you’.</p>

<h4><a name="lic-2-1">2.1</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document. Indeed, you have no right to receive or view a copy or copies without first accepting this License as legally valid and binding and agreeing to the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>
<p>Redistribution includes but is not limited to displaying the Internet Editions within the graphical representation of an Internet site other than the Distribution Point. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the use of HTML ‘frames’.</p>
<p>An exception to the restrictions on redistribution in this section is made in that you may send the Internet Editions or derivative works thereof to the Distribution Point by the consent of the Maintainer.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-4">2.3</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators retain all other rights to their respective portions of the Internet Editions not covered by this License.

<h4><a name="lic-2-5">2.4</a></h4>

<p>If a person is under the legal age to be able to enter into a contractual relationship as defined by the laws of the area in which that person resides, they may have a parent or legal guardian agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License.

That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

<h3><a name="lic-4">4. Jurisdiction</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-4-0">4.0</a></h4>

<p>If, in consequence of court judgement or the laws of a particular area, any portion of the License is held as invalid or unenforceable in any particular circumstance, you are no longer granted any rights under the terms of this License in that circumstance. You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-5">5. Revision of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-5-0">5.0</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and the Illustrators may publish revisions of this License in the future to address new concerns. Any further revisions will be legally binding at the time that you receive notification in any form of the revision.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
