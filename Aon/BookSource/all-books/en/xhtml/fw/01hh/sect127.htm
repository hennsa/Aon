<h3>127</h3>

<p>You pull over in order to check the battle damage and allow the rest of the convoy to catch up with you. Fortunately the vital rear sections of your roadster—the fuel tank, axle, and tyres—are still intact. Most of the damage has been absorbed by the trunk and the fender, but the incident makes you sorely aware of the need for better protection, and you make a mental note to ask Cutter to help you reinforce the bodywork at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the convoy arrives. Having passed the burning remains of your adversaries the others are relieved to find you still in one piece. You inform them that the bikers were Detroit Lions, probably scouts, and that you suspect that the clan is no more than thirty miles away. ‘Well, at least those two you ran into won’t be reporting our position to Mad Dog, or anyone else for that matter,’ says Cutter, wryly.</p>
<p>‘Even so,’ says Uncle Jonas, ‘we daren’t afford t’ stop too long in any one place. We gotta keep ahead o’ that pack all the way to Big Spring.’</p>
<p>The next town on the freeway is Sweetwater. Most of the buildings are still standing, although few have roofs as a result of yesterday’s storm. Except for a few hungry coyote that have come down from the hills looking for jack rabbits, the place is deserted.</p>
<p>Cutter signals for you to stop. The engine of the bus is overheating and, despite the risk of a clan attack, it must be allowed to cool down. The others take the opportunity to search the town for food, and you busy yourself by refuelling your roadster. ‘What do you make of that, Cal?’ says Uncle Jonas, as you finish rewinding the tanker’s fuel pipe. He is standing on the cab of the tanker, pointing at a shimmering ribbon of light to the south of the town. You climb up beside him and immediately you see that it is the sun reflecting off the surface of a small lake. ‘Water!’ you both exclaim, excitedly.</p>
<p>The chance of replenishing the colony’s depleted water supply is too good an opportunity to miss. Uncle Jonas helps you load some empty plastic containers onto your roadster, and Kate volunteers to come with you to help fill and carry them. As soon as she is aboard, you start the engine and drive off towards the distant lake.</p>
