<h3>137</h3>

<p>The journey southwest to Lake Lewisville is a slow and arduous trek across rough terrain, but one that cannot be avoided as you skirt around Denton. When finally you sight the dry lake, it is clear that crossing it will be a dangerous business as the convoy will make an easy target to anyone occupying the surrounding high ground. You must get the convoy across in the shortest time possible.</p>
<p>The bed of the lake is littered with rusted car wrecks and old household machinery. Between these heaps of twisted scrap are avenues covered with slabs of broken earth that jut upwards at all angles, their sharp edges baked hard by months in the furnace-like heat. The bus and the tanker, both heavily laden, are soon reduced to a snail’s pace for fear of shredding their tyres, and you are forced to stay close in case they break down or fall victim to an ambush.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have picked is 0–6, <a href="sect281.htm">turn to 281</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 7–9, <a href="sect160.htm">turn to 160</a>.</p>
