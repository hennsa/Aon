<h3>176</h3>

<p>You spring to your feet and run at the exit. However, the stripy-faced youth, whom you encountered earlier wielding a lasso, suddenly appears in the doorway, blocking your escape. As he reaches for a revolver, which is tucked into his waistband, you lower your shotgun and fire. Only one barrel discharges—the other misfires—but the blast is great enough to lift your adversary off his feet and send him cartwheeling out of the door.</p>
<p>You leap over his body and run along an alley that leads into a side street. You hear the mob yell out when they find the body, and you know that they will press their pursuit, so frantically you search for somewhere safe to hide. An old boarding house on the corner of the street looks like the answer to your prayers. You enter before the mob reaches the end of the alley.</p>
