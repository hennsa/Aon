<h3>177</h3>

<p>‘Let’s go!’ says Cutter, and simultaneously you leap into action. Your sudden appearance draws a volley of shots from a shallow gully situated twenty yards ahead, and a wave of fear knots your stomach as the bullets whistle past your head. Then Kate and the others open fire and force the bikers to duck behind their parapet of earth.</p>
<p>On the far side, Cutter races across the rocky ground as fast as his skinny legs will carry him. A biker pops out of the gully like a jack-in-the-box and fires his pistol at your friend’s lanky form, missing him by inches. Cutter fires back, a snap shot from the hip that hits the biker full in the chest, sending him spinning backwards into the trench. Three more bikers appear, panicked by the death of their confederate. One falls victim to covering fire; the second is felled by Cutter’s second barrel; but the third escapes the crossfire and comes running out of the gully straight at you. He yelps with horror as he sees you, skids to a halt, and levels his pistol at your face.</p>
