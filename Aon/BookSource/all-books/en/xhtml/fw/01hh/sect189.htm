<h3>189</h3>

<p>‘Strawn is held by a gang o’ renegades,’ says Mountain Goat, looking west along the freeway in the direction of the town. ‘There’s ’bout forty of them. They was kicked out o’ San Angelo six months ago after they tried to take over the Angelo clan from Mekong Mike. He sure whomped ’em real good. Those that got away came north an’ settled here. They’re known as “the Skulls” on account o’ their shaved heads, an’ their leader is a real mean dude called Alcatraz. He an’ his gang have got Strawn sewn up like a genuine fortress, just in case Mekong Mike should ever get the idea to come an’ pay ’em a surprise visit.’</p>
<p>Dangerous though it would be, a raid on Strawn must be attempted. Cutter proposes that you and he should be the ones to go: he can identify the part that is needed, and you are by far the fittest member of the colony. You swallow your fear and agree to go with him at first light.</p>
