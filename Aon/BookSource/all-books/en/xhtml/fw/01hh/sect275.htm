<h3>275</h3>

<p>Your enemy’s reactions are lightning fast. He throws himself down behind the window and your gunfire passes harmlessly through the now empty frame. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) An instant later, the unexpected sound of running feet makes you spin on your heel. A leather-clad punk, his skull shaved and sprayed with rings of metallic brown paint, is charging at you from the ruins with a knife held high in his hand. You raise your weapon, but before you can squeeze the trigger, he dives full length and catches you in the chest with the crown of his head. His attack slams you backwards to the ground and, gasping for breath, you struggle to grab hold of his wrist before he can make use of his deadly blade.</p>
<p class="combat">Copperhead: <span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> 14   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 24</p>
<p>Owing to the suddenness of his attack, you must fight the first two rounds of combat unarmed and with your <span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> reduced by 2 points. If you are still alive at the start of the third combat round, you will then be able to draw your Hunting Knife.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the fight, <a href="sect63.htm">turn to 63</a>.</p>
