<h3>295</h3>

<p>As soon as Cutter has the engine running smoothly and everyone is back on board the bus, you return to your roadster and lead them west to Weatherford.</p>
<p>As the afternoon wears on, the rays of the sun cast a blood-red hue on the surrounding landscape. Ahead, the freeway cuts a straight line due west, towards the high peaks of the Edwards Plateau that pierce the horizon like a row of sharpened flints, jagged and blue. You stare into the distance, trying to relax and not think about the dangers you have faced today, or the unknown perils that lie ahead.</p>

<p>An hour later you catch sight of Weatherford and signal the convoy to stop. You are hungry and must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Despite the delays, the convoy is making better time than expected, and with at least an hour of light still remaining, it is decided that it would be best to press on to the next town and make camp there overnight.</p>
<p>You are finishing your food when suddenly Pop Ewell calls to everyone to hurry to the bus. He has located a broadcast on his CB radio set, and he is as excited as a youngster on Christmas morning. ‘Listen to this,’ he says, holding up the earphones. A faint call sign can be heard above the crackle of static, broadcasting the same message repeatedly: ‘Radio KLFM. Mineral Wells … Radio KLFM. Mineral Wells … ’</p>
<p>‘That’s a town about twenty-five miles northwest o’ here,’ says Cutter, scratching his scalp. ‘It’s not where we’re planned on headin’ but it would be worth checking out.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to volunteer to go to Mineral Wells and investigate the source of the radio broadcast, <a href="sect74.htm">turn to 74</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to ignore the broadcast and insist that the convoy continues along its chosen route, <a href="sect93.htm">turn to 93</a>.</p>
