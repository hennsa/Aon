<h3>297</h3>

<p>Carefully, Kate examines a package she has removed from the saddle-bag. It is about the size of a man’s shoe, covered with a shiny black plastic wrapping, and has a keypad and timer attached to its side.</p>
<p>‘Well, it looks like we got ourselves one mighty big fire-cracker here,’ she says, offering it to you for inspection.</p>
<p>‘What is it?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘About seven pounds of military grade Zevatec explosive; enough to make a hole the size of this lake.’</p>
<p>‘That’s some fire-cracker!’ you reply, uneasily.</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry, it’s safe,’ she assures you, taking the explosive from your trembling hands. ‘I saw the Lions use this stuff in Oklahoma. It’s as stable as clay until you prime and time it, then … boom! I think I’ll hang on to it. It could come in useful.’ She slips the Zevatec into her bag and then walks back towards the lake.</p>
<p>‘C’mon Cal,’ she says. ‘We’d better hustle that water. When that scout gets back to the Lions, Mad Dog’s gonna be hot on our heels.’</p>
<p>You fill the containers<sup><a href="#sect297-1-foot" name="sect297-1">13</a></sup> and hurry back to Sweetwater as fast as you can. When you tell Uncle Jonas what has happened at the lake, he cancels the food search and recalls everyone to the bus. As soon as all are safely aboard, you head back onto the freeway and begin the sixty-six mile journey to Big Spring.</p>
