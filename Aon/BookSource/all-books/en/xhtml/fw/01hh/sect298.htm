<h3>298</h3>

<p>Cautiously, you drive through the centre of the town, your nerves like coiled springs as you scour every inch of the ruins for some sign of life. Having reached the far side of Denton and seen nothing untoward, you decide to turn your car around and head back towards the convoy. Then you hear the sound of motorcycle engines being kicked into life, and suddenly three bikes burst out of a wooden building near the centre of the town and come racing towards you, their riders whooping like Red Indians. All three machines are carrying pillion passengers who are armed with an assortment of weapons. As the first bike draws level, its passenger gets ready to leap into the seat beside you.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>, and add to it your current Driving skill total.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0–10, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 11 or more, <a href="sect244.htm">turn to 244</a>.</p>
