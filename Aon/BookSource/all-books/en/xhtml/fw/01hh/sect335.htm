<h3>335</h3>

<p>‘Looks like you got your bath sooner than you expected,’ you say, gently brushing aside a few tangled strands of blonde hair that are hanging down in front of her face.</p>
<p>‘That’s the second time you’ve saved my life,’ she says, sheepishly. ‘It’s getting to be a habit.’ She smiles, holding you with her eyes as she kisses her own hand and touches it to your cheek. You feel drawn towards her and, as your lips meet and you feel the tenderness of her touch, it is as if nothing else in the world exists.</p>
<p>The illusion of peace is shattered by a burst of gunfire. ‘What the … ?’ you cry, as bullets slap the water and punch a line of holes along the muddy shore.</p>
<p>‘Clansmen!’ shouts Kate, pointing across the lake at two figures silhouetted against the cloudless sky. Quickly you grab her by the arm and run towards the cover of some rocks topped with thorny foliage, growing less than twenty yards away. The clansmen snigger as they raise their machine pistols to fire at your fleeing forms.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth skill total.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 7 or less, <a href="sect114.htm">turn to 114</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 8 or more, <a href="sect57.htm">turn to 57</a>.</p>
