<h3>68</h3>

<p>You relay the message to the others and they begin to laugh. ‘I think the heat’s finally got to you, Cal!’ jokes Hammer Harlan. ‘Here, let me listen to those ’phones. Ain’t nothin’ wrong with my hearin’.’ You pass him the headphones, but before he has had a chance to put them on, the insect-like sound of a small engine draws all eyes to the west.</p>
<p>‘Well, I’ll be … !’ mutters Hammer, scarcely able to believe his eyes. High in the azure sky you see a tin flying machine with fragile, bat-shaped wings. Spellbound, the colony watches as the plane circles above the town and comes in to land on the stretch of freeway that approaches the bridge. Slowly the pilot extricates himself from the tiny, motorized hang glider, and gives a friendly wave as he strides towards the group.</p>

<p>‘The name’s Rickenbacker,’ he says, removing his goggles and shaking Uncle Jonas by the hand. ‘I’m from Big Spring. I saw y’all while I was scoutin’ the freeway and thought I’d drop by. Shame about the radio: ’fraid my set’s seen better days.’</p>
<p>Rickenbacker warns the colony that a large group of clansmen is riding towards the town from the east. They are less than five miles distant and closing fast. He also tells you about another gang of bikers, a clan called the ‘Mavericks’, who have been the bane of the Big Spring colony for the last six months. They control the city of Lubbock, 100 miles to the north, and their raiding parties are in the area foraging for food. ‘I know the next thirty miles ain’t gonna be easy for you folks, but there’s a big welcome waitin’ for y’all at Big Spring,’ he says, as he gets ready to take to the air once more. ‘Don’t delay now. We’re countin’ on you to make it through.’</p>
<p>As soon as he is airborne, the colony sets to work on the bridge with renewed vigour. The Lions are closer than anyone dared imagine and everyone is eager to get across the river before they show up. When Cutter announces that the bridge is safe, you drive the roadster across the platform and park it on the freeway ready for a fast getaway. The colony crosses over on foot, and Cutter drives the empty bus across the bridge. The platform creaks and shudders, but Cutter is able to cross safely to the far side. Together with Kate, the three of you return to help guide Uncle Jonas and the tanker across.</p>
<p>Just as the front wheels are about to mount the platform, Kate screams a warning: ‘The Lions are here!’</p>
