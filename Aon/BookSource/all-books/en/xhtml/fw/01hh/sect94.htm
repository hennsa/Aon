<h3>94</h3>

<p>The lake occupies the centre of a saucer-like depression and, as you bring your roadster to a halt at the edge of this rocky rim and stare down at the shimmering water below, you are heartened to see that clumps of vegetation are growing close by: a sure sign that the water is not contaminated.</p>
<p>The sides of the depression are steep and covered with loose shale. Rather than risk a fall, you suggest to Kate that perhaps you should go down to the lake alone. When you reach it, she could throw the containers to you, and then help you with them when you climb back out. The idea does not impress her. ‘It’s been so long, I can’t remember the last time I took a dip in some real water. I’m sick a’ washin’ in sand. If you think I’m gonna hang around up here while you splash about down there, you’ve got another think comin’, buster!’</p>
<p>With that she grabs two of the plastic containers and lowers herself over the edge. Seconds later you hear her scream and you rush forward to see her tumbling head-over-heels towards the lake. She hits the water with a loud splash and disappears from view. Briefly she surfaces, thrashing her arms and shouting: ‘Help, Cal! I can’t swim!’</p>
