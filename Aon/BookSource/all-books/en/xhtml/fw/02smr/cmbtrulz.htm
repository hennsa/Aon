<h3>Rules for Close Combat</h3>

<p>There will be occasions when you will have to fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy’s <span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> level will both be given in the text. Your aim in close combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to zero or below while losing as few of your own <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points as possible.</p>
<p>At the start of a close combat, enter both your own and your enemy’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points in the appropriate boxes on the Close Combat Record section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for close combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through the use of close combat weapons to your current <span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />

         Example<br />
         Cal Phoenix (<span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> 17) is attacked by a Renegade Clansman (<span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> 18). He is not given the opportunity to evade close combat, but must stand and fight his adversary. Cal Phoenix is armed with a Hunting Knife, so he adds 2 points to his <span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span>, giving a total <span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> of 19.<br />
        <br /><br />
He subtracts the Renegade Clansman’s <span class="smallcaps">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</span> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +1 (19 − 18 = +1). He notes this +1 on his <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>After working out your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="crtable.htm">Close Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the number that you have picked (the random numbers appear down the side of the chart). You now have the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost by both Cal Phoenix and his enemy in this round of close combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; CP represents points lost by Cal Phoenix.)<br /><br />

         Example<br />
         The Combat Ratio between Cal Phoenix and the Renegade Clansman has been established as +1. If the number picked from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> is a 4, then the result of the first round of close combat is:<br />
        <br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Cal Phoenix loses 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</li>
<li>Renegade Clansman loses 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to the participants in the close combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, start the next round of close combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from stage 3.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This procedure continues until the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points of either the enemy or Cal Phoenix are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Cal Phoenix is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Cal Phoenix proceeds but with his <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="crsumary.htm">Summary of the Close Combat Rules</a> appears on the page after the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade close combat. If you have already engaged in a round of close combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored; only Cal Phoenix may lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points during that round, but that is the risk of running away! You may evade combat only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
