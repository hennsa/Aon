<h3>115</h3>

<p>You hold your breath and try not to move as the clansman rummages through a tool box less than four feet from where you are crouching. Unfortunately, the dust he is stirring up causes you to sneeze, betraying your presence. Suddenly, one of the gasolene drums is rolled aside and you feel two strong hands grab your jacket and drag you to your feet.</p>
<p>‘What are you up to?’ growls the scar-faced Detroit Lion, his stinking breath making you pull away in disgust. ‘Sabotage, is it?’ he spits, accusingly.</p>
<p>‘Nah … I ain’t no saboteur,’ you reply, stalling for time, as you let your hand drift slowly towards your close combat weapon. ‘I’m an Angelino who jus’ wants t’see the race. I’m supposed to be patrolling the south zone but ain’t nothin’ ever happens down there. Gimme a break, will ya?’</p>
<p>As your fingers close around your weapon, you see something that makes you hesitate. At the rear of the truck you glimpse a large crowd of clansmen who are queueing to enter the stadium. The sight dissuades you from attacking your accuser, and instead you decide to try offering him a bribe.</p>
