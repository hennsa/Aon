<h3>154</h3>

<p>For a moment you are blinded by a deluge of stones and stinking water as you drive through the aftermath of the explosion. Then, as you catch sight of the opposite bank, there is another blast and you feel your steering wheel pulling sharply to the left.</p>
<p>‘We’ve lost a tyre,’ you shout, as you battle to get the car onto dry land. You succeed in reaching the far bank and skid sideways to a halt. You both leap out quickly and take cover behind the engine compartment. The clansmen seem to have exhausted their supply of grenades, but they are all armed with machine pistols and they proceed to empty them in your direction.</p>
<p>Kate draws her pistol and prepares to give covering fire while you inspect the damage. The front left tyre has been shredded by shrapnel and is beyond repair. You will have to replace it with the spare tyre you carry in the trunk. However, in order to retrieve it, you will have to expose yourself to bursts of machine pistol fire.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth skill score. Now add the combined figure to your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score.</p>
<p class="choice">If the resulting total score is 28 or less, <a href="sect144.htm">turn to 144</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the total score is 29 or more, <a href="sect194.htm">turn to 194</a>.</p>
