<h3>160</h3>

<p>‘It’s them!’ cries Knott, as he sights the convoy vehicles trundling along the freeway towards Kent. Led by Pete Tyler’s tow truck, the convoy pulls into the town with all horns blaring and everyone shouting their relief and delight that the rendezvous has been accomplished. It is a joyous reunion, made especially happy by the return of Kate to the colony.</p>
<p>After the excitement has abated you settle down to discuss the more serious matters at hand. From his vantage place in the sky, Rickenbacker has been able to track the movements of Amex Gold and his Maverick clansmen. A large contingent of them have been shadowing the convoy and are now in ambush somewhere in the mountains ahead. Also, Pop Ewell has monitored by radio the movements of a large Mexican clan, who have crossed the border in search of fuel and food. And, to make matters even worse, Mad Dog Michigan has linked up with the ‘Saints’, the clan from New Orleans, and now they too are somewhere in the vicinity.</p>
<p>‘Looks like we’re surrounded by enemies,’ says Cutter, volunteering his opinion. ‘Seems to me we’ve got to keep movin’ if we’re to stand a cat’s chance o’ gettin’ to El Paso in one piece.’</p>
<p>His opinions are shared by the majority, and so it is decided to leave Kent this afternoon and press on to El Paso without delay.</p>
