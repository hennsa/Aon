<h3>172</h3>

<p>You rise at dawn and spend the morning servicing the engine of your roadster, while Sergeant Haskell and Marine Knott take it in turns to act as lookout from the roof of a Baptist church, the tallest building still standing in Kent. It is two hours before noon when you hear a faint buzzing noise, high in the sky towards the northwest. You search the cloudless expanse and your hopes soar as you see Rickenbacker’s motorized hang glider circling above the town. He comes down and makes a low pass, waving his arms excitedly as he flies directly over the roadster. Then he is gone, rising above the surrounding peaks and returning the way he came.</p>
<p>An hour passes before Knott sights a cloud of dust on the eastern horizon. You are all gathered in the town, waiting expectantly for the convoy to arrive, but he cannot be sure that it is the convoy that is coming. At such a distance it could be a gang of marauding clansmen.</p>
