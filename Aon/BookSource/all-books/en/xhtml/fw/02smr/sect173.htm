<h3>173</h3>

<p>With your nerves stretched almost to breaking point, you lower the cover gently into position and whisper to Kate to continue along the tunnel.</p>
<p>By feeling her way along the thick cables that festoon the walls of this service shaft, she is able to make progress in the dark. More than half an hour later you emerge into a wider section where a faint light seeps down from glass bricks embedded in the ceiling around a circular steel hatch. A ladder ascends to the hatch and Kate suggests that this one could be worth investigating. You agree, and when you lift up the heavy steel cover carefully and look out, she is proved right: the sight that greets you is the entrance gate to the Reagan Memorial Stadium.</p>
<p>After waiting until there is little clan activity in the immediate area, you climb out of the shaft and make your way quickly into the ruins of the southern central sector of the San Angelo stronghold.</p>
