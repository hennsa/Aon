<h3>18</h3>

<p>The clansman is no more than ten feet away when you spring up from your hiding place and bring your barrel to bear. Your gunfire catches him in the side and spins him backwards to the slippery floor. For a moment he shudders, and then falls still as his last breath escapes from between his blood-flecked lips. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.)</p>
<p>Kate moves forward to check that he is dead and to search his body. She keeps what she needs: his machine pistol, a quantity of ammunition, and his water canteen, and offers the rest of his possessions to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enough food for one Meal</li>
<li>Enough sulfonamides for one Medi-kit unit</li>
<li>Flick Knife (2)</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Binoculars</li>
</ul>
<p>If you keep any of these items, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>As soon as you are ready, you retrace your way along the defile and return to the surface.</p>
