<h3>194</h3>

<p>Kate places her shots carefully in an effort to conserve ammunition. The effectiveness of her covering fire keeps the clansmen pinned down long enough for you to retrieve the spare tyre, jack, and wheel brace from the trunk of the car.</p>
<p>As you start work on changing the damaged front wheel, you see the clan scout leader riding down the opposite bank towards the river. Believing that you are now out of ammunition, he has decided that he will be the one to enact his clan’s revenge on you for the killing of Mekong Mike. Howling curses, and whirling a heavy motorcycle chain above his shaved head, he rides his bike into the shallow river. He is halfway across when Kate takes aim and silences his screaming with a single shot to the heart. The sight of him crashing into the river stuns the remaining clansmen just long enough for you to complete your wheel change and jump back into the car.</p>
<p>As you reach the top of the bank and speed away towards the distant highway, you glance over your shoulder to see the Angelino scouts retrieving their leader’s body from the fetid waters of the South Concho River.</p>
