<h3>199</h3>

<p>Nervously the clansman glances over his shoulder as you close in for the kill. His red-rimmed eyes stare fearfully from his dusty face as he struggles to coax more power from his failing machine. Then, in desperation, he veers off the highway and takes to the open ground. You are determined not to let the clansman escape, and so you pull the steering wheel hard over to the left and pursue him as he guns his bike cross-country towards Highway 87.</p>
<p>An empty concrete drainage ditch runs parallel to the freeway, wide enough to deter the biker from attempting to ride straight across it. He veers away, and you chase him along its edge for nearly half a mile before finally he plucks up enough courage to try to get across. Ahead, a derelict pump house appears, straddling the ditch, its angular roof offering itself as a ramp that could be used to launch a jump onto the freeway. The clansman takes one last look at you over his shoulder and then, with a scream of fearful exhilaration, he winds back the throttle and points his bike at the pump house roof.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to follow the clansman across the ditch, <a href="sect192.htm">turn to 192</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to steer your roadster away from the pump house, <a href="sect51.htm">turn to 51</a>.</p>
