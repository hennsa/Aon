<h3>217</h3>

<p>You reach down into the passenger foot-well and retrieve your rifle. Fortunately you know that the weapon is loaded and all you have to do is thumb back the safety catch to make it ready to fire. The moment the clansman sees you rest the barrel on the door, he veers across to the left lane of the highway as quickly as he can. You smile as you realize the purpose of this manoeuvre: he is trying to increase his chances of survival by making it as difficult as he can for you to shoot at him with your right hand.</p>
<p>Keeping the roadster in a straight line—and the sheer force of the rushing wind whipping around the end of the rifle’s barrel—make it impossible for you to take aim. You try to get as near to your enemy as you can before squeezing the trigger, but just as you are about to fire, you hit a pot-hole and lose your grip.</p>
<p>Add your Stealth skill score to your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score. Now pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add it to your total.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 32 or less, <a href="sect251.htm">turn to 251</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 33 or more, <a href="sect307.htm">turn to 307</a>.</p>
