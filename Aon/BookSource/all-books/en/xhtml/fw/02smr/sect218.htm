<h3>218</h3>

<p>You try to wake Kate but she is in a deep sleep and does not respond immediately. When at last you succeed in rousing her it is too late to attempt a quick getaway by car.</p>
<p>You watch tensely as the bikers ride into the town. You give a silent prayer that they will pass through Eldorado without stopping, but to no avail. They bring their machines to a halt in the middle of the town and begin a search of the surrounding ruins. ‘They mustn’t find us,’ you whisper, as you look around the workshop for somewhere to hide. ‘If they do we’re as good as dead.’</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps echoes through the building as you help Kate to conceal herself in an old stationery cupboard. Once she is well hidden, you slip inside an adjoining storage room that is filled from floor to ceiling with musty mohair blankets. Minutes later, you hear a clansman walk into the workshop. You hold your breath and listen to his every move, but your concentration is suddenly broken when you feel something crawling up the back of your left hand.</p>
