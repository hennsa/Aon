<h3>219</h3>

<p>The time Sergeant Haskell used to observe the barricade was well spent. He noticed that the Mexican clansmen have positioned an anti-tank weapon behind it, which doubtless they will bring into action if it is needed. Littered around it are several dozen boxes of shells. If one of those boxes were to explode, it would set off the others and destroy most of the central section of the barricade. Haskell has an incendiary grenade which would do the job, but in order to make sure that it landed in the correct place—in one of the boxes of ammunition—one of you would have to go to the barricade and place it there. Neither of you are keen to volunteer for this mission, so you decide to settle it on the toss of a coin. Sergeant Haskell calls and, unfortunately, you lose.</p>
<p>Haskell gives you the incendiary grenade and you hand him your signal flare. Then, when the Mexican clansmen on guard are at their fewest, you leave the cover of the yucca forest and creep towards the barricade. (Erase the Signal Flare from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>Ten yards from the wall of cars you see an opportunity to throw your grenade into an open ammunition chest.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth skill score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 5 or less, <a href="sect198.htm">turn to 198</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 6–7, <a href="sect272.htm">turn to 272</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 8 or more, <a href="sect244.htm">turn to 244</a>.</p>
