<h3>234</h3>

<p>The crash brings the car to an abrupt halt and you are brought back to full consciousness when your chest is slammed by the hub of your steering wheel: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Kate is saved from serious injury by her seat belt harness, which she had fastened before she fell asleep. The bone-breaking jolt of the crash has awoken her and, disorientated and bleary-eyed, she asks why you have stopped.</p>
<p>‘We ran out of road,’ you say, sheepishly, as you stagger out of the driving seat and go to inspect the damage. Your heart sinks when you discover that the front chassis, the frame on which the wheels and engine are mounted, is badly bent out of shape. To repair this damage you will need to cut and re-weld the buckled frame.</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not possess both these items, <a href="sect105.htm">turn to 105</a>.</p>
