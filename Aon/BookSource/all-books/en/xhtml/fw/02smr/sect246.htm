<h3>246</h3>

<p>While he was firing, unbeknown to you, the clansman moved forward and he is now lying flat on his stomach behind the rear wheel of his motorcycle. So when you return fire it is aimed at the wrong place and it rattles harmlessly off the iron bridge support where you first saw him take cover. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Before you realize your error, he opens up once again and sweeps the gully with a long burst of automatic fire. Pain lances your forearm and shoulder as you stop two of his twenty high-velocity bullets.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> (in this instance 0 equals 10) and add 1 point. The total is equivalent to the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points you must lose as a result of your wounds.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have survived the shooting, <a href="sect332.htm">turn to 332</a>.</p>
