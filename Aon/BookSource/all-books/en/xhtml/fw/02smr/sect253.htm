<h3>253</h3>

<p>Desperately you search along the dashboard, the seats, and the foot-wells, but you find nothing that even vaguely resembles an ignition key. However, you do uncover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shotgun (with two rounds of 12-gauge ammunition)</li>
<li>Water Canteen {with sufficient water for two Drinks)</li>
<li>Antiseptic Dressings (enough for one Medi-kit unit)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you are unable to start the jeep, you are forced to abandon it and take cover, once more, amongst the ruins. You perch yourself behind a wrecked car that is balancing on top of the wall and cast your eyes across to the far side of the killing zone.</p>
<p>One building stands out from all the others: it is the ruins of a fire station. There is still no sign of the clansmen, so together you agree to make a dash for that building. You tell Kate that, when she is running, she should focus all her thoughts and efforts on getting inside the place as quickly as possible. If anything happens, on no account should she stop for you.</p>
<p>Add together your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score and your Stealth skill score. (Note: If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> is low and you are heavily encumbered, it may be advisable to discard some of your Backpack Items in order to increase your Stealth skill level.)</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is 10 or less, <a href="sect117.htm">turn to 117</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is 11–16, <a href="sect295.htm">turn to 295</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is 17 or more, <a href="sect334.htm">turn to 334</a>.</p>
