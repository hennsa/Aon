<h3>260</h3>

<p>It comes as a relief to discover that the town of Sierra Blanca is deserted. Here the convoy halts to assess the damage and treat those who were wounded during the run. Cutter is among those who need treatment, having stopped a bullet in his left forearm. However, although you can tell he is in considerable pain, he does his best to hide it.</p>
<p>Kate greets you with a kiss that leaves you in no doubt about how pleased she is to see you alive and in one piece. Together you go to the school bus for some food and water (restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points), and while you are there, you listen to Pop Ewell as he tries to make radio contact with the WDL unit in El Paso. After several attempts, he manages to raise them, but they refuse to acknowledge his call unless he gives a WDL security call sign, a sort of radio password that will prove he is not a clansman trying to trick his way into the city stronghold.</p>
<p>‘Cal, will you go an’ fetch Sergeant Haskell? I think we’ll be needin’ his help to solve this,’ says Pop, and eagerly you oblige.</p>
