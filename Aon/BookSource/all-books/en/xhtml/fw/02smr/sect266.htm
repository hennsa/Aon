<h3>266</h3>

<p>You raise your head and take aim at the bridge, but before you squeeze the trigger you notice that the clansman is no longer there: he has changed his position. He is now lying flat on his stomach behind the rear wheel of his motorcycle. Swiftly you swing around and open fire at the bike. Your gunfire rips into the rear tyre and catches the clansman full in the face, killing him instantly. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.)</p>
<p>Before you bury them you search both bodies and the bikes, and discover the following useful items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pistol (containing four rounds of 9mm ammunition)</li>
<li>Dagger (2)</li>
<li>Water Canteen (containing enough water for three Drinks)</li>
<li>Leather Face Mask</li>
<li>Rope</li>
<li>Machine Pistol (containing twelve rounds of 9mm ammunition)</li>
<li>Cigarette Lighter</li>
<li>HE Grenade</li>
<li>Enough pain killers for one Medi-kit unit</li>
</ul>
<p>There remains no trace of the bikers or their machines when eventually you complete your grisly task of burial. Wearily you return to your roadster and begin the next stage of your journey to San Angelo. Less than a mile beyond the bridge you see a deserted stretch of Highway 87. You join the freeway, heading south, and within a few minutes you catch sight of a town on the road ahead. A glance at your <a href="map.htm">map</a> confirms that you are approaching Sterling City.</p>
