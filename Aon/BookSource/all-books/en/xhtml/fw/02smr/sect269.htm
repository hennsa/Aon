<h3>269</h3>

<p>Your escape from the building goes unnoticed by the few clan patrols that are operating in the area. Mekong Mike has brought most of his men up to the central and northern sectors, partly as a show of strength to Mad Dog Michigan and partly as a precaution in case Mad Dog’s talk of an alliance turns out to be a bluff, and he is really here to try to take over the city.</p>
<p>The further you venture north, the more clan activity you find, and you are forced to stay hidden for longer periods as you snake your way through the ruins towards the centre of the stronghold. You are working on the assumption that Kate is with Mad Dog Michigan, and he is likely to be found where the number of clansmen is greatest.</p>
<p>It is shortly before noon when you catch sight of a building that dominates the centre of San Angelo—the Reagan Memorial Stadium. Scores of motorcycles and their riders are gathered around its entrance where two large, tattered banners are fluttering symbolically in the breeze. One bears the lion’s-head mark of the Detroit Lions clan; the other is emblazoned with the long-horned-steer skull symbol of the Angelinos clan. From your location opposite the entrance you overhear two Angelinos talking. You learn that some sort of motorcycle race is to take place here this afternoon, to celebrate the signing of a pact between the two clans. Now you feel sure that Mad Dog and Kate are here somewhere inside the stadium, and you apply yourself to finding a way in.</p>
<p>After watching the entrance for over an hour, only two options appear open to you. You can try to hide in one of the trucks that are carrying spares for the clansmen’s bikes, in the hope that they will enter the stadium before the race; or you can attempt to scale the stadium wall at one of the many places where it has partially collapsed.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to try to stow away in one of the service trucks, <a href="sect299.htm">turn to 299</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to attempt to climb over the wall, <a href="sect93.htm">turn to 93</a>.</p>
