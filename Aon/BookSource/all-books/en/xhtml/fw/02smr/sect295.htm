<h3>295</h3>

<p>Halfway across the open ground there is a sudden burst of machine gun fire and a line of bullets slams into the rubble near your feet. A ricochet cuts you across the back of your left hand and you cry out in pain as you cradle the wounded limb to your chest: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Kate looks over her shoulder, her face aghast, and begins to slow down to allow you to catch her. But you scream that you are OK, and order her to keep running at all costs.</p>
<p>More shots ring out, but they fall wide of their mark and you are able to reach the fire station ruins. Much of the roof has collapsed, although you can see that one vehicle, a paramedic truck, has survived the devastation virtually unscathed.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the vehicle, <a href="sect232.htm">turn to 232</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to ignore it and press on with your escape, <a href="sect148.htm">turn to 148</a>.</p>
