<h3>313</h3>

<p>In order to prise the dead dog from your arm, you are forced to stand up in your driving seat. Meanwhile, the pack handlers have gathered together the rest of their surviving coyote and now intend to set them on you. They yell an order, and the mountain dogs bound forward, snapping and howling. Kate replies by drawing her pistol and firing, bringing down three of the leading dogs in as many shots. She buys you the few precious seconds you need to free yourself from the dead coyote, but before you can lower yourself behind the wheel, the handlers return fire and you feel something thump you in the back. You feel no pain and, almost fearing to acknowledge that you have been hit at all, you reach for the ignition and bring the roadster back to life. Then, with a cloud of dust and burnt rubber, you say farewell to the coyote and take off along the main street towards the Christoval bridge.</p>
<p>Kate heard the impact made by the bullet and, fearing the worst, she leans over to take a look at your back. You hear her breathe a sigh of relief as she discovers that the bullet has lodged itself in the bottom of your water canteen.</p>
<p>Erase from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> any water that you may have been carrying in your canteen. You need not erase the canteen itself as it can be repaired and is still serviceable.</p>
