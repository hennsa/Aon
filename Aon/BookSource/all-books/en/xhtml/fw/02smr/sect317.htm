<h3>317</h3>

<p>You leave the highway and drive across the stony ground that borders the town of Christoval and the South Concho River. The land here is far too rough for you to be able to drive at speed and, as you glance in your mirror, you are sorely aware that the bikers are closing the gap. Your only chance of escape is to find a way across the river and get back onto the highway.</p>
<p>Kate too senses the danger, and knows what must be done. She keeps her eyes peeled on the river, looking for somewhere suitable to cross, while you negotiate a way through the boulders that lie scattered in your path.</p>
<p>‘Over there, Cal!’ she shouts, pointing to a shallow-sided section of the river bank. Immediately you steer towards it and power your car down the gentle slope towards the foul-smelling water. Here, the tainted river is less than a foot deep and the rocky bed provides a firm grip for your tyres.</p>
<p>You are halfway across when you hear a dull thud. Suddenly there is a flash of orange-red flame and a column of splintered rocks and black water erupts from the river a few feet ahead. The clansmen are firing grenades!</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have picked is 0–3, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have picked is 4–9, <a href="sect154.htm">turn to 154</a>.</p>
