<h3>32</h3>

<p>You stamp on the brake pedal and spin the wheel to the right, causing your car to twist about and slide sideways along the highway. The sudden shriek of your tyres and the sight of your roadster hurtling towards him broadside on makes the clansman panic. He empties his magazine yet not one of the armour-piercing loads hits your roadster. Horrified, he fumbles to reload his weapon, but before he can do so, he is hit by the rear of your car and sent tumbling over the side of the bridge.</p>
<p>His confederate has managed to start his bike and is racing across to the other side. You slam the gear shift into low and give chase, determined to prevent him from warning Mad Dog Michigan that you are coming to pay him a visit. Beyond the bridge you chase the biker up a steep incline to the top of a ridge and, as you crest the top, you see him gunning his machine towards Highway 87, less than half a mile away.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to draw a missile weapon and fire at the biker while you are pursuing him, <a href="sect327.htm">turn to 327</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to try to ram him off the road, <a href="sect199.htm">turn to 199</a>.</p>
