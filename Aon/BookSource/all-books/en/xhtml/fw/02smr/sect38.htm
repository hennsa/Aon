<h3>38</h3>

<p>Reaching over your head, you grasp the rounded handle of your shotgun and unsheathe it from its storage place behind your seat. It is loaded, and a glance at the breech tells you that the safety catch is set to fire. The moment the clansman sees you resting the twelve-gauge barrel on the door, he veers across to the left lane of the highway as quickly as he can. You smile when you realize the purpose of this manoeuvre: he is trying to increase his chances of survival by making it as difficult as he can for you to shoot at him with your right hand.</p>
<p>Add together your Driving and Shooting skill scores. Now decide how many rounds you wish to fire at the clansman (minimum: one round; maximum: four rounds), and add the number of rounds to your skills total.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 5 or less, <a href="sect318.htm">turn to 318</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 6 or more, <a href="sect19.htm">turn to 19</a>.</p>
