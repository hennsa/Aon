<h3>55</h3>

<p>When eventually you regain consciousness, you feel as though you have broken every bone in your body (lose 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points). Fortunately, your bones are still intact and, as your strength returns, you look around for some means of escaping from the shaft.</p>
<p>Eventually you discover a service hatch in the roof of the elevator. The bolts undo with little resistance and you are able to lower yourself into the elevator compartment. Without power, the doors will not respond to the control buttons, but an emergency crank located in the floor allows you to wind them open by hand.</p>
<p>Beyond the doors you discover the remains of a large private restaurant which, along with its kitchen, occupies most of the sub-basement level. A small ‘fire exit’ sign hangs over the double doors leading to the kitchen and you head straight towards them. As you are crossing the restaurant floor, your rumbling stomach reminds you that you have yet to eat anything today. Then the thought occurs to you that there could still be some canned food in the kitchen and you resolve to search it before you leave the building.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Perception skill score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 11 or less, <a href="sect159.htm">turn to 159</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 12 or more, <a href="sect233.htm">turn to 233</a>.</p>
