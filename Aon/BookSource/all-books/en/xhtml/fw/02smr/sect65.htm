<h3>65</h3>

<p>Silently you draw your gun and slip off the safety catch. The clansman is less than six feet away when he sees you crouching on the dry river bed. His eyes widen and he opens his mouth to scream a warning to his partner, but it is a scream of pain that leaves his lips when you open fire at his chest. (Remember to erase the appropriate number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>As the clansman’s body topples into the gully, you catch sight of his partner running head-down towards the bridge. He pauses to grab a machine pistol from his motorcycle before diving for cover behind one of the iron bridge supports. Seconds later he reappears and fires a stream of bullets at your position.</p>
<p>You keep your head low and wait for a lull in the shooting before you break cover and return fire at the clansman.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your current Shooting skill score. For every round of fire that you wish to discharge at your opponent, add 1 point.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 9 or less, <a href="sect246.htm">turn to 246</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 10 or more, <a href="sect266.htm">turn to 266</a>.</p>
