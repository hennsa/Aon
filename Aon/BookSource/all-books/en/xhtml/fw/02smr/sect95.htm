<h3>95</h3>

<p>Simultaneously you step into the corridor and raise your rifle to your shoulder. The guard to the left of the staircase sees you but has no time to shout a warning before your bullet finds its mark. (Remember to deduct a round of 7.62mm ammunition from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) He spins backwards and falls heavily at the foot of the stairs as you work another round into the breach. Then you swing the barrel towards his partner, knowing only too well that you must make your second shot count just as effectively, but by the time you have him in your sights you are shocked to find that you are staring into the muzzle of his machine pistol.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth skill score and your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 19 or less, <a href="sect297.htm">turn to 297</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 20 or more, <a href="sect197.htm">turn to 197</a>.</p>
