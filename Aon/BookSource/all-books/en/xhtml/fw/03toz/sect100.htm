<h3>100</h3>

<p>After considering the situation, Captain Frankland calls the team together in a room at the rear of the derelict café. ‘We’ve got two options, men,’ he says, quietly. ‘Either we ambush the trucks before they reach the race track, or we hit ’em once they’re inside. What d’you think, sergeant?’</p>
<p>Haskell shifts uneasily, his face lined with concentration. ‘I think we’re gonna have t’ blow them once they’re inside, sir. We don’t know for sure which direction they’ll approach from, and, considerin’ what they’ve got on board, I doubt if they’ll stop for anything until they’re safe inside Michigan’s HQ.’ You nod in agreement, as does Marine Knott.</p>
<p>‘Very well then. If we can’t ambush ’em on the outside, we’ll have to get inside the track and destroy ’em there. It’ll make our chances of escape a whole lot shorter, but I agree with you—I reckon we have no choice.’</p>
<p>Having decided on a plan of action, Sergeant Haskell distributes the mines, one to each man. ‘Set the timers to five minutes,’ he says, and demonstrates how to do this using his own charge. ‘They’re magnetic, so try to fix them to the fuel tank if possible. Failing that, place them as near to the explosives as you can get.’</p>
<p>You examine the heavy, saucer-like device and then carefully set its clockwork timer, according to Haskell’s instructions. Finally, you flick across the safety cover so that it protects the detonator button, and slip the mine inside your Backpack.</p>
<p>Record the Contact Mine on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item. If you already possess the maximum quota of Backpack Items, you must discard one article in its favour.</p>
