<h3>117</h3>

<p>Your enemy screams and crumples as you deliver your killing blow. He hits the floor, and, as he rolls towards the tailgate, you notice a Pistol and a Knife (2) tucked into his belt. (If you wish to keep the Pistol, you discover that it contains eight rounds of 9mm ammunition.)</p>
<p>Sergeant Haskell is recovering from his fall as you move towards the cab to try to find out what is going on. To your horror you see a bright yellow bulldozer, with its earth scoop lowered, trundling along the main street on a collision course with the truck. Captain Frankland is screaming at Knott to move the truck out of the way of the oncoming bulldozer, but the engine refuses to start. The situation is looking hopeless when suddenly, with a roar, the engine fires into life. Knott kicks the gas pedal and swerves out of the way as the bulldozer bears down. Miraculously, it misses you, rumbling past with barely inches to spare.</p>
<p>In an attempt to escape from the town, Knott heads towards a narrow side street, but as soon as you enter, you are confronted by another hazard. Several of the houses that back on to the street have collapsed and the debris has formed a huge, uneven mound, which blocks your path. Knott, confident that the truck is capable of scaling this obstacle, shifts the gear selector into all-wheel drive and stamps his foot on the gas pedal. Amid a whine of gears, the truck accelerates towards the mountain of bricks and shattered timbers. You hit the mound at speed and lurch towards the peak, but less than five feet from the top the truck shudders to a halt.</p>
<p>Knott and the captain both leap from the cab, desperate to clear away the debris that has jammed the front wheels. As they begin their work three clansmen come running around the corner, firing their weapons as they sprint towards you. Haskell answers them with a burst of fire that fells the leading two, and sends the survivor scurrying for cover. However, this does little to deter the attack. More clansmen are appearing by the second, and from the sound of their blood-curdling screams they intend to take no prisoners.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a missile weapon and wish to fire at the advancing clansmen, <a href="sect69.htm">turn to 69</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to help the captain and Marine Knott clear away debris from the front wheels, <a href="sect3.htm">turn to 3</a>.</p>
