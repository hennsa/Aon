<h3>124</h3>

<p>As the team prepares to leave, the captain briefs you on the plan of attack. ‘Once we’re on the inside and the convoy arrives, we’ve got to place the mines as quickly as possible in case they decide to off-load the explosives. From now on we stick together. Move quickly on my command and no firing unless it’s absolutely unavoidable. Also, keep your eyes peeled for a suitable escape vehicle. We’ll need to find one before we set the mines. We’ve got only five minutes to make our getaway, and I sure don’t want to be around when those trucks go up. There’ll not be a whole lot left o’ this place once those mines explode.’</p>
<p>After the briefing, you follow the captain in single file as he leads the team through a series of interconnecting alleys that takes you to the race track’s west gate. Most of the clansmen are congregated at the front of the track, around the east gate, making it easy for you to gain access to the track at the rear without being seen.</p>
<p>Once inside, you make your way through the now-empty kennels and administration blocks, to a position opposite the track itself. Here you catch a glimpse of your old enemy—Mad Dog Michigan.</p>
