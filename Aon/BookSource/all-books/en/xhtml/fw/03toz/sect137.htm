<h3>137</h3>

<p>The tracks lead to a drug store at the centre of the town. It looks as if Kate parked your car here and went inside the store, for there are two lines of footprints in the dust, running from the street to the front door.</p>
<p>The others wait in the truck while you enter the store. Following in Kate’s footsteps, you arrive at some empty places on the store’s shelves. She was after medical supplies, although she was selective about what she took. The shelves still hold a few medicines and other medical supplies—enough for two Medi-kit units. (If you wish to keep these, remember to mark them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>Having satisfied your curiosity, you go back to the truck and tell the others what you have found. Captain Frankland is anxious to reach Lordsburg before dark, so he orders Knott to turn the truck around and head back to Interstate 10.</p>
