<h3>14</h3>

<p>In an instant your exhilaration vanishes and a cold, numbing fear returns to chill your spine. You freeze, not daring to move a muscle in case you betray your hiding place. Suddenly you hear the sound of feet moving through the scrub, and you know that the sniper is approaching and that you must act quickly if you are to escape alive.</p>
<p>Frantically you scramble to your feet and run headlong into the forest. You have covered less than twenty yards when you chance a glance over your shoulder to see someone following in your wake. You are moving too swiftly to be able to discern their features, yet you dare not slow your pace to satisfy your curiosity. It could prove to be a fatal mistake.</p>
<p>Soon the timberland begins a steep descent towards the plateau. Although you have difficulty checking your speed, you manage to stop yourself by clinging to a trunk at the edge of the clearing.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to dash across the plateau towards the cover of the pines on the far side, <a href="sect240.htm">turn to 240</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to skirt around the plateau under cover of its perimeter trees, <a href="sect207.htm">turn to 207</a>.</p>
