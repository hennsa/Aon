<h3>168</h3>

<p>At first you are shocked that Captain Frankland and Sergeant Haskell are firing at you. But, as the first wave of bullets kicks up the dust on the highway, your natural instinct for self-preservation takes over.</p>
<p>The only cover is a shallow gully that runs alongside the highway, and immediately you steer towards it. Another burst of fire follows you: this time the bullets strike home, slamming into the front of the motorcycle and destroying the tyre. As you leave the highway you lose control of the machine, and the last thing you are aware of is the bars twisting in your hands: lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>When you regain consciousness, you are lying in the back of the truck with the captain and the sergeant standing over you. Your head aches viciously, but apart from a slight concussion and a massive bruise on the left side of your skull, your body has survived the crash with little injury.</p>
<p>Marine Knott survived the crash without suffering any harm, and has been busy fitting the ignition unit to the truck. Now that the others are sure that you are all right, they check one last time that the engine is running smoothly and then continue north along Highway 81.</p>
