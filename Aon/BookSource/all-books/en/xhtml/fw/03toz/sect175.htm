<h3>175</h3>

<p>The sun has disappeared behind the mountains and dusk is turning to darkness when you reach the small town of Elfrida. It was once the centre of a close rural community, but now it is no more than a sorry collection of wind-damaged stores and cabins straddling the stream. Aching with fatigue, and the pain of the minor injuries which you have sustained during your flight from the assassin, you decide to investigate the little town and rest there awhile.</p>
<p>A derelict diner with a cellar offers the best place for shelter. Attempting to reach Tucson, alone and in the dark, does not strike you as a good idea, so you decide to spend the night here in the cellar and continue tomorrow at first light. Worried that the assassin may still be on your trail, you set about barricading the cellar door. Only when you are sure that he could not possibly enter without waking you, do you settle down for some much needed sleep.</p>
<p>Before you sleep you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect110.htm">turn to 110</a>.</p>
