<h3>179</h3>

<p>You reach for your gun but a gruff voice bellows: ‘Hold it right there!’</p>
<p>The clansman stands silhouetted in the doorway, as his bloodhound comes loping across the desk towards you. Desperately you throw yourself out of the window before he can raise and fire a gun. Your swift action undoubtedly saves your life, for the Angelino has taped his torch to the barrel of his machine pistol, which is already aimed at your chest. As you make your move, he pulls the trigger, spraying the window with a deadly hail of lead. The frame is ripped to pieces yet none of the bullets find their mark.</p>
<p>An iron fire-escape platform breaks your fall, but not without injury. Its surface is littered with glass and you suffer several minor cuts to your hands and knees—lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point. Galvanized by the shock of coming so close to death, you ignore the cuts and stagger down the fire escape as quickly as you can.</p>
