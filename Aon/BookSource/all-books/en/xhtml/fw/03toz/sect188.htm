<h3>188</h3>

<p>Suddenly you hear shouts and sporadic gunfire amid the engine noise, and then there is a dull thud and the floor shudders violently as the truck smashes through the barricade. Haskell loses his grip and is thrown heavily against your legs as the truck bucks and twists like an angry stallion. Haskell’s fall dislodges you and together you tumble across the floor as the vehicle slews sideways across the highway. Then there is a second thud, louder than the first, and the truck comes to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>You are dazed and bruised but still conscious enough to know that something is seriously wrong. Your gun lies by your side and automatically you reach for it as you struggle to your feet. Your hand has just closed around the barrel when you see two Mexican clansmen climbing over the tailgate.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to open fire at these clansmen and are able to do so, <a href="sect267.htm">turn to 267</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to open fire, or if you are unable to do so, <a href="sect312.htm">turn to 312</a>.</p>
