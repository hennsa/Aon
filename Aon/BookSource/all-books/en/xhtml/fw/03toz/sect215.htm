<h3>215</h3>

<p>You aim and fire at the approaching clansman, the rising barrel of your weapon blocking your target for just an instant. As your gun comes down from its recoil you see him staggering on the steps, his eyes bulging and his hands clamped to his chest. Then his legs buckle and he falls from the stairs to land, with a dull, heavy thud, on the dried-up bank of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>‘What the … ?’ hisses the captain, his eyes wild with anger and fear as he turns to face you. Then, in the next instant, all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>Alerted by the sound of your gunfire, the clansmen who are guarding the toll bridge immediately rush to their searchlights and train them on the walkway entrance. Within seconds the whole area is bathed in white light, revealing the team, and the bodies of the two dead clan sentries. Swiftly the area is surrounded by the enemy who open fire mercilessly. Unable to find cover or escape from this deadly ambush, all four of you fall victim to the clansmen’s guns.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your mission end here.</p>
