<h3>22</h3>

<p>With the clansman’s position fixed in your mind, you spring up from behind the tailgate and raise your gun to fire. The truck is bumping along the highway, making it impossible to take accurate aim, but for an instant he fills your sights and immediately you pull the trigger.</p>
<p>Your shooting proves deadly accurate: the bullet hits him in the forehead, killing him before he can transmit his radio message. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Haskell looks at you and grins. He is clearly impressed by your marksmanship. He is about to congratulate you when the truck decelerates. When it stops, Captain Frankland leaves the cab and comes around to the back to check that you are both all right.</p>
<p>‘We’re fine,’ you reply. ‘Bruised, but otherwise just fine.’</p>
<p>You help the captain climb over the tailgate. Then, as soon as he is aboard, Knott restarts the engine and you continue on your journey west along Highway 9.</p>
