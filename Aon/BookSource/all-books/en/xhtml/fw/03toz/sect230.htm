<h3>230</h3>

<p>It is not long before Interstate 10 appears on the horizon, its surface glowing warmly orange in the light of the setting sun. When you reach the junction, Knott drives onto the freeway and brings the truck to a halt to allow Captain Frankland to inspect the surface. The tyre tracks of several heavy vehicles are clearly visible in the dust, indicating that the colony has passed this way some time in the last six hours. The discovery is well received; it confirms that the convoy broke out of El Paso successfully, and it raises your hopes for an early reunion with Kate and the others.</p>
<p>Seven miles west of the junction, the remains of a small New Mexican town stands less than a mile from the freeway. A set of fresh tyre tracks veers away from the freeway and heads towards the town. The tracks are quite distinctive and you recognize them at once: they were made by the tyres that are fitted to your roadster.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ask Captain Frankland to follow the tyre tracks, <a href="sect137.htm">turn to 137</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to say nothing, <a href="sect33.htm">turn to 33</a>.</p>
