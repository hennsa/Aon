<h3>241</h3>

<p>You watch the assassin remove a banana-shaped magazine from his pocket and insert it in a slot in front of the rifle’s trigger guard. Then he shoulders the weapon and takes up a pair of binocular-like field glasses, which hang from a strap around his neck. He places them to his visor and methodically scans the surrounding rooftops. This strikes you as a curious thing to do as the buildings are very close: surely he does not need binoculars to see if anyone is standing on top of them? Then a chill stabs your heart when he scans the first floor windows of the courthouse and you realize that he is not using a regular pair of binoculars: they are sophisticated, high-resolution, image intensifiers.</p>
<p>Immediately you duck back from the window, but you fear that he has already located your position.</p>
<p>Pick a number from <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have picked is 0–3, <a href="sect173.htm">turn to 173</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4–9, <a href="sect327.htm">turn to 327</a>.</p>
