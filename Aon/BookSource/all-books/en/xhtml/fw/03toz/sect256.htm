<h3>256</h3>

<p>You wake shortly after dawn feeling thoroughly refreshed after ten hours’ uninterrupted sleep: restore 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. The barricade is still intact and, once it is dismantled, you arm yourself and investigate the cabin above. Nothing has been touched during the night, prompting you to believe that you may, at least for the time being, have given the assassin the slip.</p>
<p>After eating breakfast, you set about unpacking and constructing the motorcycle. There is sufficient gasolene stored in the cellar to fill its tank, but you can find no engine oil. The motorcycle’s oil level is very low and you can only hope that it will get you as far as Tucson before breaking down.</p>
<p>After studying the <a href="map.htm">map</a>, you mount your new vehicle and set off along the road, heading west through the Swisshelm Mountains. You enjoy the cool breeze whipping through your hair as you ride at speed along the empty highway, and you cover more than twenty miles before you come to a small town with a sign that proclaims:</p>
<div class="signpost">GLEESON WELCOMES CAREFUL DRIVERS</div>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stop at this mountain town, <a href="sect64.htm">turn to 64</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to ride through without stopping, <a href="sect50.htm">turn to 50</a>.</p>
