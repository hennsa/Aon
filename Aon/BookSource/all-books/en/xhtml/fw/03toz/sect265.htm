<h3>265</h3>

<p>The howling grows louder. Then you catch sight of them, two slack-jowled bloodhounds, padding their way across Montana Avenue with two clansmen close behind. One of the men is carrying a machine pistol, the other a long-handled flashlight.</p>
<p>One of the dogs smells the meat and bounds towards it, but the other ignores his brother and continues to lead his torch-wielding handler straight towards you. He sees you, and begins to bark wildly, alerting his handler to your presence.</p>
<p>‘Run for it!’ you hiss. ‘We’ve been seen!’</p>
<p>Knott increases his speed and you follow him, praying that you will reach cover before the clansmen open fire. Your prayers are answered. In his haste, the clansman drops his flashlight, and before he can retrieve it and switch it on, you follow Knott through the open door of a derelict building.</p>
<p>‘We stand a better chance if we split up,’ you say, casting an anxious glance over your shoulder at the yellow light that is streaming through the doorway. ‘But remember—meet up at the bridge as planned.’</p>
<p>The torchlight illuminates the interior sufficiently for you to be able to make out two possible exits: a carpeted staircase leading to the first floor, and another leading down to the basement.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ascend the stairs to the first floor, <a href="sect237.htm">turn to 237</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to descend to the basement, <a href="sect58.htm">turn to 58</a>.</p>
