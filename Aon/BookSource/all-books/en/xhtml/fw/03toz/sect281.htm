<h3>281</h3>

<p>You gun the motorcycle along the wide trench until you find a rocky slope that offers a way back onto the highway. The ascent is difficult, and when you reach the crest of the gully, you fall and become pinned beneath your motorcycle. As you struggle to free yourself you notice that the cloud of dust has stopped less than half a mile distant. The outline of a man’s head and shoulders can be seen leaning across the saddle, which is supporting a rifle.</p>
<p>Chilled by the thought of your murdered companions, you renew your efforts to get free. You are pulling yourself upright when a shot rings out and an agonizing pain explodes in your left temple. The pain fills your head and courses down your spine, bringing you crashing back to the ground. The pain disappears, to be replaced by a numbness that dims your vision and drains the last of your strength from your unfeeling limbs. An overwhelming desire to sleep assails your senses, and, although you fight to stay awake, it is a fight you have no chance of winning.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your mission end here in Arizona.</p>
