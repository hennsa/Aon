<h3>288</h3>

<p>Beyond the freeway, the ground slopes away towards a unit of industrial buildings, all extensively damaged by the post-holocaust storms. Clan patrols, many with dogs, are active in the vicinity but the ruined factories provide enough cover for you to avoid them without too much difficulty.</p>
<p>You make good progress until you reach a wide highway once known as Dyer Street. A clan command station, complete with equipment dumps and a vehicle workshop, has been set up among the stores bordering this main street. It crosses your mind that the stores must contain weapons and provisions that would be useful to the colony, but when you lose count of the number of clansmen that are entering and leaving them, you abandon the idea of a raid and concentrate on the mission in hand.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the clan command station you are forced to follow Dyer Street south, towards the heart of the city. You have covered more than a mile before you reach a place, close to the Municipal Park, where you are able to cross the street without risk of being seen. Once safely across, you enter the park and continue on your way west. As you reach the west side exit, a truck appears, catching you in the glare of its headlights. You both freeze, fearing the worst. It continues to approach, and then, with a screech of brakes, it veers aside and stops nearby. The driver jumps from the cab and, without a word, strides off towards a building directly opposite the park.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take a closer look at the truck, <a href="sect174.htm">turn to 174</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to ignore the truck and hurry away before the driver returns, <a href="sect138.htm">turn to 138</a>.</p>
