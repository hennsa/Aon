<h3>29</h3>

<p>The clansman is halfway down the steps when your warning shout echoes from the bridge. Instantly, Sergeant Haskell reacts by springing forward and pounding up the steps towards the Mexican clansman, his combat blade held before him ready to strike. The Mexican sees Haskell and freezes in mid-step, his eyes widening with fear and shocked surprise. As he fumbles for his pistol, the sergeant tackles and stabs him to the heart, sending him tumbling backwards to land with a heavy thud on the stone-hard bank of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>‘Well done, sergeant. And you, too, Cal,’ says Captain Frankland, as the team gathers at the entrance to the walkway and sets about disposing of the sentries. ‘If the guy on the steps had had the chance to raise the alarm, we’d have had the whole of Mad Dog’s army down on us by now.’</p>
<p>After the clansmen have been consigned to the Rio Grande, you check your equipment and then follow the others as they hurry away from the walkway area.</p>
