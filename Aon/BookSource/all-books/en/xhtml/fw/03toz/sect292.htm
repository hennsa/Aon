<h3>292</h3>

<p>With bated breath you watch as Sergeant Haskell and Captain Frankland stalk towards the jeep. The two Mavericks are oblivious of their presence as they circle around silently and creep up on them from behind. A heavy, belt-fed machine gun, mounted on a column behind the front seats, helps to conceal their approach until they are crouching behind the jeep itself.</p>
<p>For a few seconds there is absolute silence, and then you see them leap forward and grapple the unsuspecting clansmen, striking swiftly and silently. As soon as it is all over, the captain signals to you and Knott to join them. You rush to the jeep and help the sergeant search the Mavericks’ bodies before hiding them in the bus depot.</p>
<p>On your return to the vehicle, Captain Frankland offers you the opportunity to drive.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to drive the jeep, <a href="sect142.htm">turn to 142</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to let the captain drive, <a href="sect30.htm">turn to 30</a>.</p>
