<h3>309</h3>

<p>The growl of motorcycle engines can be heard approaching from the south, yet you can see no sign of their headlights in the near-darkness that blankets the land. Then you spot a glint of chrome reflecting the pale pre-dawn twilight, and suddenly there is a piercing blue-white glare as six black-clad clansmen simultaneously switch on their headlights as they race along Highway 80 towards the intersection. Their machines are drawn up in a perfect wedge formation, giving them the semblance of a giant, fiery arrow-head as they come speeding down the freeway access ramp towards your jeep. Now, as they close in, you see that the riders are wearing black face-protectors, which are fitted with infrared lenses, enabling them to see in the dark without the need for artificial light. They are all heavily armed, and the pennons that flutter from the whiplash aerials fixed to their saddles identify them as scouts for the Detroit Lions clan.</p>

<p>These scouts are part of a group that were based in Ciudad Juarez. You notice that each machine carries a radio and you realize that they must have been directed by Mad Dog Michigan to intercept you. Several of their closest comrades died at the Juarez Race Track and they have sworn to avenge their deaths by wiping you out.</p>
<p>‘Get going, Cal!’ shouts Captain Frankland, as he drops the now empty can and leaps into the jeep. You start the engine and accelerate straight at the oncoming wedge of bikers. They see you and part formation, firing their pistols at point-blank range as they stream past on either side.</p>
