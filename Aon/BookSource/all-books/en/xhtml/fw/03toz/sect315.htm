<h3>315</h3>

<p>With your face to the ground, you peer under a row of cars to see the clansmen’s feet as they reach the base of the ramp. For a few seconds the men remain stationary, and then they split up and begin to search along the rows in your immediate vicinity. Carefully you ease yourself under a pick-up truck and watch with growing fear as one of the clansmen walks slowly towards your hiding place.</p>
<p>He stops beside the pick-up, his boots inches away from your chest. Automatically you tense yourself in readiness to strike should he show the slightest indication that he has found you. He starts to move away, and then hesitates. Slowly he begins to kneel.</p>
<p>At that moment you lash out like a striking cobra and catch him in the leg with the heel of your boot. He screams and falls backwards, clutching his dislocated knee. This allows you the few seconds you need to roll out from under the truck and to gain the upper hand.</p>
