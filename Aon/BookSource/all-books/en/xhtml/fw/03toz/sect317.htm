<h3>317</h3>

<p>You run to the trash can and haul yourself over its thick steel rim just as the first of the bikers reaches the apex of the bridge. Seconds later the captain’s voice bellows the order: ‘Open fire!’ Immediately the others obey, strafing the Angelinos as they speed off the bridge. Two riders are hit and fall from their machines; a third has his front tyre shot out and loses control, crashing into the parapet; but the last rider appears to escape injury and comes screaming over the bridge with his front wheel raised defiantly. As he approaches you he raises his machine pistol one-handedly and looses off a burst of automatic fire.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to remain standing and return fire as the biker speeds past, <a href="sect48.htm">turn to 48</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to avoid his fire by ducking below the rim of the trash can, <a href="sect135.htm">turn to 135</a>.</p>
