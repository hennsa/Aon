<h3>328</h3>

<p>Your gunfire is accurate—it hits the biker in the head—but it does not divert his machine. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) The fact is, the biker is already dead, killed by a ricocheting bullet as he sped over the bridge. He is slumped forward over the handlebars in a racing pose, his right hand locked on the throttle and his weight balanced to keep his machine upright and fixed in a straight line.</p>
<p>In desperation you scramble to your feet to throw yourself out of the path of the bike, but you have left it too late. With a fearful crash, the motorcycle ploughs into the gas pump and explodes in a ball of bright flame. The last thing you see is a blinding yellow flash as you are engulfed by the blazing inferno. Death is instantaneous.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your mission end here in Mexico.</p>
