<h3>345</h3>

<p>The truck slams through the wall of cars with a tremendous crash. The impact sends a violent shudder through the floor but the truck is slowed very little by the collision. Once clear of the barricade, Knott accelerates along the main street and you hear angry voices and the sharp crackle of automatic gunfire amidst the roar of the vehicle’s engine. The air becomes livid with the sound of singing bullets, which pierce the canvas and shatter against the truck’s cage-like frame. An occasional fragment singes your skin but otherwise you and the sergeant escape unharmed.</p>
<p>Haskell is at the tailgate, returning fire at the clansmen who were guarding the barricade, forcing them to quit their shooting and dive for cover. You join him and focus your sights on the doorways of the passing stores, where sleepy-eyed clansmen are stumbling into the street to investigate the commotion. (Erase from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a> ammunition equivalent to one round of fire.)</p>
<p>You are starting to feel confident that you have beaten the clansmen when you feel the truck decelerating. A glance over your shoulder in the direction of the cab window reveals why Knott is slowing down. A bright yellow bulldozer, with its earth scoop lowered, is trundling along the main street towards you. The captain screams an order and Knott obeys. He spins the steering wheel and sends the truck screeching sharply to the left towards a narrow side street. His quick reactions and driving skill have saved you from the bulldozer, but immediately you are confronted by a new hazard.</p>
<p>Several of the houses that back on to this street have collapsed, and the debris has formed a huge, uneven mound that blocks your path. Knott, confident that the truck is capable of scaling this obstacle, shifts the selector into all-wheel drive and stamps his foot on the gas pedal. Amid a whine of gears, the truck accelerates towards the mountain of bricks and shattered timbers. You hit the mound at speed and the truck lurches towards the peak, but, less than five feet from the top, the truck shudders to a halt.</p>
<p>Knott and the captain both leap from the cab desperate to clear away the debris that has jammed the front wheels. As they begin their work, three clansmen come running around the corner, firing their weapons as they sprint towards the truck. Haskell answers them with a burst of fire that fells the leading two and sends the survivor scurrying for cover. This does little to deter the attack: more clansmen are appearing by the second, and, judging by their blood-curdling screams, they do not intend to take prisoners.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a missile weapon and wish to fire at the advancing clansmen, <a href="sect69.htm">turn to 69</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to help the captain and Marine Knott clear away the debris from the front wheels, <a href="sect3.htm">turn to 3</a>.</p>
