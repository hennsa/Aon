<h3>4</h3>

<p>Your target falls to the ground, but you cannot be sure if he has been hit or if he is diving for cover. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) You move away from the window in case he tries to return fire, and with nerves on edge, you wait a full minute before chancing another glance out of the window. The assassin is nowhere to be seen, and you fear that he may have gained access to the courthouse. With gun in hand, you peer into the passage outside, and then through the banisters at the entrance and lobby below: all are empty.</p>
<p>You decide to make your escape from the courthouse while you can. The passage leads to a fire exit. Through a crack in the door, you see that the yard outside is empty, so you push open the locking bar and pass through. You have taken only a few steps from the door when the assassin rushes around the corner of the courthouse with his rifle in his hand.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess sufficient ammunition for one round of fire, <a href="sect181.htm">turn to 181</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="sect270.htm">turn to 270</a>.</p>
