<h3>54</h3>

<p>The man is easy to follow: a trail of freshly broken foliage clearly marks his escape route through the trees. His tracks end at a clearing, where a wide, crater-like hollow has been excavated from the rocky soil. You catch a glimpse of him hurrying into the hollow by way of a flight of steps that has been cut out of the earth. As you approach the crater, you notice that one side is constructed entirely from logs, and resembles the side of a pine cabin. Frantically the man bangs his clenched fists on a heavy door in the centre of the log wall, screaming to be let in. The door opens and he falls through it, slamming it shut behind him with a heavy thud.</p>

<p>Cautiously the two of you move towards the steps, your weapons ready and your eyes fixed on the closed door. ‘He must be a survivor. He’s got himself some sort of underground shelter here,’ says Knott, having realized by now that you are not tracking the man who is responsible for the murder of your two companions. ‘I think you’re right,’ you reply, ‘and I guess he’s not alone. Someone opened the door.’</p>
<p>A few yards to the right of the door you notice an oblong-shaped air vent. You are about to descend the steps and investigate it further when a single gunshot rings out and you feel something hit you sharply in the back. A bullet has clipped your Backpack. The force of its impact takes your breath away and sends you tumbling to the floor of the crater: lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point and erase one Backpack Item from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. You curse your would-be assassin but you are thankful that your equipment has saved you from sustaining a more serious wound.</p>
<p>‘Dammit!’ growls Knott, as he leaps from the steps and lands at your side. ‘He’s found us.’ Together you rise and run towards the door, seeking shelter. Knott bangs his fists on its rough timbers and pleads to be allowed in, but to no avail. The door does not open.</p>
<p>‘We’ve gotta get inside,’ you say, as you scan the trees beyond the edge of the crater. ‘We’re sitting ducks out here.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess an HE Grenade and wish to use it to attempt to gain entry, <a href="sect114.htm">turn to 114</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Tenon Saw and wish to use it, <a href="sect343.htm">turn to 343</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess neither of these items, or if you choose not to use them, <a href="sect38.htm">turn to 38</a>.</p>
