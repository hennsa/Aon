<h3>6</h3>

<p>‘It could be the sniper,’ whispers Knott, wide-eyed with fear. Immediately the two of you step off the trail and crouch behind the nearest tree. Without daring to breathe, you stare fixedly at the forest ahead, glimpsing movements among the foliage. Then you catch sight of a man’s bearded face and Knott, his nerves stretched to breaking point, draws his pistol and looses off three rounds in quick succession.</p>
<p>The bullets rip open the bark of a pine tree less than a foot from where the man is standing. Startled, he freezes with shock, and then he takes to his heels and crashes noisily through the foliage in his desperation to get away.</p>
<p>‘Ha! That’s seen him off,’ says Knott.</p>
<p>‘Yeah,’ you reply, but your voice is tinged with doubt. You are not convinced that a crack HAVOC assassin would have allowed himself to have been seen so easily, or have behaved in such a way when coming under fire. ‘Let’s make sure he doesn’t come back,’ you say, and beckon Knott to follow as you give chase.</p>
