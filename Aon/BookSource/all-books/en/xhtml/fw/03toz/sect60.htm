<h3>60</h3>

<p>The moment you realize that the sergeant and captain have mistaken you for clansmen, you take evasive action. The only cover is a shallow gully that runs alongside the highway, and immediately you steer towards it. Bullets are kicking up the dust in a line that follows you all the way off the road, but your skill and the speed of your reactions save you from being hit and enable you to bring the bike to a controlled halt.</p>
<p>It takes several minutes of shouting before you are able to convince Frankland and Haskell that you are not the enemy. When at last they realize their mistake, they throw down their guns and run towards you with looks of abject horror on their faces. Both men are clearly shocked at how near they came to killing you.</p>
<p>Once you have all got over the shock, you busy yourselves by helping Knott replace the damaged ignition unit. The new unit works perfectly, and within half an hour of your return the engine is running smoothly and you are able to continue.</p>
