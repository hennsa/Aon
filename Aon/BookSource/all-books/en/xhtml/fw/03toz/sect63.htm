<h3>63</h3>

<p>The clansman slumps lifelessly across the bodies of his two dead dogs, his hand still grasping his crowbar in a vice-like grip. You try to prise it loose but soon abandon the attempt in favour of searching his pockets instead. You discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enough food for one Meal</li>
<li>Pistol (containing three rounds of 9mm ammunition)</li>
<li>Knife (2)</li>
<li>Whistle</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to keep any of these items, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>Rather than wait for his confederates to find his body, you leave the archway and attempt to find your partner. Knott is crouched in hiding beneath an archway further south. He sees you as you pass and attracts your attention by whispering your name. The discovery of the handler and his dead dogs sends the clansmen into a frenzy of activity and immediately they launch a manhunt. Fortunately, they start by searching some distance away, enabling the two of you to slip away unseen.</p>
