<h3>71</h3>

<p>You race up the stairs and find an office that overlooks the main street. From the window you watch the clan rider bring his motorcycle to a halt at the edge of town. He is wearing a close-fitting black leather riding suit, a full-face black crash helmet, and is sporting a rig of combat equipment that makes him look like a futuristic space warrior.</p>
<p>Slowly he climbs off his machine, pausing briefly to adjust the controls of his air-conditioned riding suit. Then he unsheathes a scoped rifle from his saddle holster and advances along the main street, using the shadowy doorways of the stores and offices to cover his approach. He is thirty yards away, on the opposite side of the street, when he stops to select an orange-tipped bullet from a pouch at his hip. You watch with fearful anticipation as he presses the round into the breech of his rifle, raises the weapon to his shoulder, and takes aim at your motorcycle. There is a sharp crack, followed by a roaring boom as the incendiary round ignites and explodes the fuel tank.</p>
<p>With pounding heart, you watch as coolly he lowers his rifle and proceeds to reload it.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to shoot the assassin while he is busy reloading his rifle, <a href="sect111.htm">turn to 111</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have insufficient ammunition, or if you choose not to fire at the assassin, <a href="sect241.htm">turn to 241</a>.</p>
