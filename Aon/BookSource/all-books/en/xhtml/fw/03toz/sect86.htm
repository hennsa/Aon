<h3>86</h3>

<p>Comfort is hard to find as the truck speeds along the pot-holed Mexican highway that heads west out of Ciudad Juarez. You brace your feet against the bench seat opposite and hang on to the tailgate with your free hand in an effort to keep the bruising to a minimum, but to little avail. Outside, the mountains rush past on either side, lit by the moon yet softened by the clouds of dust billowing in the truck’s wake. Both the captain and the sergeant are searching the truck while you keep a watchful eye open for the clansmen. Your thoughts wander, and you find yourself thinking of the perils that must be facing Kate and the rest of the colony at this moment as they stage their vital break-out from Fort Bliss. You can only hope and pray that the destruction of Mad Dog’s headquarters has secured their escape.</p>
<p>A flickering pin-prick of light alerts you to danger. It grows brighter, and then divides into two, three, and then five. The lights grow larger until you can make out the silhouettes of five clan bikers speeding along the highway in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>‘We’ve got visitors!’ you shout, steadying your gun. But Haskell and Frankland do not respond: they are examining something on the floor near the cab and do not hear your warning.</p>
<p>The leading biker is now less than ten yards away from the tailgate, his headlight shining full in your face. Gunshots crack and bullets ricochet off the rear as his pillion rider attempts to shoot you dead.</p>
