<h3>87</h3>

<p>You scream as Mad Dog opens fire with his machine pistol, and slam your foot on the brake pedal. Your swift action saves you from death but you do not escape unscathed. One bullet clips your forearm and another grazes your neck: lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Knowing that your enemy has only one hand on the wheel of his speeding car, you nudge the side of his speedster, tempting him to retaliate, and then, when he rises to your challenge, you brake heavily. Because he is still holding his machine pistol, he fails to react in time to prevent his car from crossing in front of you and hitting the central barrier. Metal twists and sparks fly from his fender as he scrapes along the crash barrier at nearly 100 miles an hour. You put your foot down and overtake him on the right, powering your roadster away as he fights to extricate himself from the barrier’s magnet-like grip.</p>
