<h3>121</h3>

<p>Quietly you inform your fellow judges of your decision and, after a brief consultation, Pop Ewell announces the verdict.</p>
<p>‘By the majority decision of this tribunal, we find Paul Avenal guilty of the murder of Michael Gorgas in the first degree. This crime is a capital offence punishable by death by firing squad. The sentence is to be carried out immediately.’</p>
<p>Upon hearing the verdict, the surrounding colonists utter a sound that is full of shocked disbelief. Avenal’s face turns white and limply he staggers back into the arms of the Tucson escorts. A lone voice in the crowd demands a re-trial, but it is ignored. Then another voice rings out, but this time it captures everyone’s attention. It is Macy, the convoy’s lookout, and he is screaming words that make your blood run cold.</p>
<p>‘The Outlaws are attacking!’</p>
<p>Without further warning, two grenades explode simultaneously in the town square and the chatter of machine gun fire echoes along the empty side streets. Screams of panic mingle with the dull booms of more explosions as the colonists rush to the vehicles to try to retrieve their weapons before it is too late. A burst of gunfire from a rooftop stitches a line of holes across the table and sends you, and the other judges, diving for cover. Suddenly everything is chaos; it’s every man for himself. You grab your gun and scurry towards a garbage cart that lies overturned on the plaza. As you skid to a halt behind the cart, you find yourself face to face with Avenal, the man you have just sentenced to death. The confrontation is shocking, but it is the sight of the pistol that he is holding in his hand that really strikes terror in your heart.</p>
<p>With a determined look in his eyes he raises the gun towards your head.</p>
<p>‘No … !’ you scream, and you close your eyes as his finger snatches repeatedly at the trigger.</p>
