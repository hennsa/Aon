<h3>144</h3>

<p>You wish Macy and Langdon good luck, and then you watch as they drive off the freeway and make a wide detour around Red Rock. As soon as they are in position on the far side, you and Rickenbacker climb back into your roadster and drive slowly towards the town. You stop fifty yards short of the suspect clan car, check your weapons, and then creep forward on foot to take a closer look.</p>
<p>While Rickenbacker acts as lookout, you search the interior of the abandoned vehicle. Apart from some discarded food wrappers, a damaged water canteen and a few items of clothing, the car is empty. You are walking to the rear of the car, intent on searching the trunk, when suddenly Rickenbacker shouts out in alarm: ‘Look out! Over there … ’</p>
<p>His warning is lost in the sound of gunfire. The staccato hammering of a machine pistol splits the air and, in the brief moment in which you throw yourself to the ground instinctively, you catch sight of a shadowy figure firing at you from the doorway of a store across the street.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Perception and Stealth skill scores.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 13 or less, <a href="sect298.htm">turn to 298</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 14 or more, <a href="sect176.htm">turn to 176</a>.</p>
