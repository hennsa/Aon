<h3>151</h3>

<p>Nobody is very keen on the idea of having a clansman aboard, especially after the murder of Mike Gorgas and the clan attack at Sentinel, but most agree that having someone with a thorough knowledge of the area with you would raise your chances of survival considerably. Finally it is agreed to let Cookie stay with the colony, but on the condition that his hands remain tied and he is treated as a prisoner, not as a colonist.</p>
<p>The night is spent at Wellton, during which time you must take a Drink or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Early next morning, after you have fixed your front tyre, you and Rickenbacker set off in the roadster to scout the land around Yuma. What you discover there confirms Jaeger’s story—the city is held in force. The Pumas have looted the ruins of the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station, and they possess some heavy ordnance, among which are several pieces of light artillery. Cookie says that they have the shells for these guns, and that they have all approach roads zeroed-in. To take the convoy anywhere within a three-mile radius of the city would be suicidal. However, you must get across the Colorado River if you are to reach your goal.</p>
<p>Eager to prove his worth, Cookie offers to show you a way to avoid Yuma and cross the Colorado without getting your feet wet. Reluctantly the colony agrees to give him a chance, and allows him to be untied.</p>
