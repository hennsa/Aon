<h3>152</h3>

<p>You wave farewell to Macy and Langdon as you accelerate away from Dateland and follow the weathered asphalt of Interstate 8 west towards the town of Mohawk. Nine miles have been clocked on your odometer when a bridge appears in the distance, and you slow down in order to check it on your <a href="map.htm">map</a>.</p>
<p>‘That bridge must cross over the San Cristobal Wash. Perhaps we’ll get lucky and find there’s some water still flowin’ beneath it, eh?’ you say, optimistically.</p>
<p>‘I wouldn’t get your hopes up too high, Cal,’ replies Rickenbacker, squinting against the glare of the sun. ‘A dried-up salt bed is all we’re likely to find.’</p>
<p>As the bridge gradually looms larger, you see something that neither of you expected. A small, makeshift tent, consisting of little more than two groundsheets roped together, has been pitched against the side of the bridge to make a shelter from the sun, and a lean, bearded man is moving about nearby.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stop and observe the man, <a href="sect115.htm">turn to 115</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to slow down and approach the bridge with caution, <a href="sect301.htm">turn to 301</a>.</p>
