<h3>156</h3>

<p>The clansman’s bullets chase you as you dive to the ground, and punch a line of holes along the side of the truck. Several of the slugs penetrate a metal container full of industrial blasting powder, which is standing in the back. A spark, caused by a steel-jacketed bullet, ignites the powder with devastating effect. Suddenly there is a brilliant flash, and a deafening roar fills your ears as the truck and its contents are blown sky high.</p>
<p>When the dust and debris have finally settled, you drag yourself to your feet and survey the destruction. The clansman did not survive the blast: his body lies a few yards away, stiff and lifeless. Across the river you can see Rickenbacker and Cookie running towards the bridge after completing their part of the plan successfully. They are relieved to see you alive. You join them in the middle of the bridge and together you return to the pick-up to report that the way across the Gila River is now clear.</p>
