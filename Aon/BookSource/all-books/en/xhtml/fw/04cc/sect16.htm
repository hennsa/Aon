<h3>16</h3>

<p>Avidly you keep your eyes on the clansman, praying that he will fail to see your roadster parked among the wrecks. He stops and takes shelter in the lee of a panel truck. After foraging around in his pockets for a cigarette lighter, he attempts to light the handmade cigarette which hangs as if glued to his bottom lip. Once it is alight, he continues his walk, this time in a direction that takes him away from your roadster.</p>
<p>The dust storm is still raging fiercely as you climb into your roadster and head back onto Highway 84. Your return to the intersection with Interstate 8 passes without incident and soon you are driving west once more towards Gila Bend. It is a difficult and frustrating drive, for you cannot shake the fear that Kate will have lapsed into a coma before you return with the Atropine, and you dare not increase your speed for fear of crashing off the freeway. The strain takes its toll—lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>During your return drive you must take a Drink or lose a further 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect160.htm">turn to 160</a>.</p>
