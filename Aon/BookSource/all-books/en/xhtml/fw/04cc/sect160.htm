<h3>160</h3>

<p>As you approach Gila Bend you are greeted by a volley of shots that brings you skidding to a halt. Two men, both of whom you know to be Tucson colonists, emerge from the dust-choked darkness and come running towards you with machine pistols clenched in their hands. They stop in front of your roadster and are about to take aim at the windshield when one of them recognizes you.</p>
<p>‘What in God’s name you doin’, boy?’ shouts Frazer, the older of the two lookouts. ‘You could o’ got y’self killed.’</p>
<p>‘Nobody told us you was out of the camp tonight,’ says Avenal, his young sidekick. ‘Where you been?’</p>
<p>Taking the tub of Atropine tablets from your jacket pocket you reply impatiently, ‘One of the DC1 colonists is sick, and if she don’t get this medicine soon she’ll die. Now please let me through.’</p>
<p>Frazer lowers his gun and moves aside but Avenal remains where he is, his gun still levelled at your car.</p>
<p>‘Ain’t she that clan-girl—Kate Norton? I heard she an’ Mad Dog Michigan were an item before you wasted his brother?’ he says.</p>
<p>‘You’d better watch that mouth o’ yours, Avenal,’ you retort, angered by his sneering comments. ‘Now get outta my way. I’m in a hurry.’</p>
<p>‘They say them clan-girls are really hot ’n’ wild. Now I bet you’d know all ’bout that wouldn’t you, Phoenix?’ he leers.</p>
<p>You try to restrain yourself but Avenal’s ugly remarks are making your blood boil.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to get out of your roadster and teach him some manners, <a href="sect237.htm">turn to 237</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to put your foot down and drive straight at him, <a href="sect35.htm">turn to 35</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to suppress your temper and ask him once more to get out of your way, <a href="sect260.htm">turn to 260</a>.</p>
