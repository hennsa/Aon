<h3>173</h3>

<p>As the three Crazies approach the pick-up, you notice that their emaciated bodies are decorated with spidery tattoos and scars left by self-inflicted cuts. Like inquisitive children they gather around the truck, pulling and prodding at its rusty trim.</p>
<p>‘What d’ you guys want?’ you say, firmly.</p>
<p>‘Hey, we jus’ wanna be friendly. Be friendly, guy … be friendly,’ drools one of the men, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>The woman laughs hysterically, and then she sidles towards your door and smiles, revealing a row of broken teeth. ‘Pretty … pretty … ’ she says, and reaches out to stroke your face. Rickenbacker is getting nervous, and out of the corner of your eye you see him fingering the grip of his machine pistol.</p>
<p>‘Let’s get outta here, Cal. These creeps are makin’ my skin crawl.’</p>
<p>‘OK,’ you reply, and reach for the ignition. The woman watches your hand move, and then she notices the Medi-kit pouch fixed to your belt and suddenly her mood changes.</p>
<p>‘This guy’s got candy!’ she squeals, and at once the two men come rushing towards your door. Like beggars they hold out their hands, and in their faces you see a desperate and hungry expression.</p>
<p>‘Give us some candy, guy,’ they plead, pitifully.</p>
<p>‘Candy’ll ease our pain, guy. Give us some candy.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to give these Crazies some of your Medi-kit units, <a href="sect265.htm">turn to 265</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to restart the truck and get away from them as fast as you can, <a href="sect29.htm">turn to 29</a>.</p>
