<h3>184</h3>

<p>Rickenbacker returns to the campsite, and, as soon as Icarus has been taken apart and packed away, the convoy sets off towards the mountains. Guided by Rickenbacker’s aerial notes, the two of you lead the line of colony vehicles through the sun-bleached mountains. It is a hot, dry, and dusty journey, during which you must take a Drink or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>It is early evening when you emerge from the final gully and see the shimmering surface of Highway 78 in the distance. Blistered road signs point to Glamis and effortlessly you follow the dust-blown highway west towards this little town, which lies at the southern edge of the Chocolate Mountains.</p>
<p>Cookie warns that you are entering territory controlled by a clan called the Chargers, who are based in the city of El Centro. Forewarned, the convoy halts on the highway, while you and Rickenbacker venture ahead to check that Glamis is safe to enter.</p>
<p>On a ridge overlooking the town, you stop to appraise the town’s safety. It looks empty and deserted, but the gathering darkness makes it difficult to be absolutely sure.</p>
