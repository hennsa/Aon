<h3>222</h3>

<p>Your shot misses the running clansman, but it passes near enough to frighten him into increasing his pace. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Rickenbacker, having now reloaded a fresh magazine, gets up and begins to weave his way through the barbecue ranges towards the fleeing enemy.</p>
<p>‘You too, Cal,’ he shouts, and you obey, your gun held ready as you follow in his tracks.</p>
<p>The clansman reaches the restaurant cabin as you and Rickenbacker emerge on the far side of the barbecue area. A burst of gunfire from the cabin doorway makes you dive for cover; then, moments later, you see something round and black fly from the doorway and land on the beaten earth path just a few yards away to your right.</p>
<p>‘Grenade!’ shouts Rickenbacker, and covers his head with his hands.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have picked is even (2,4,6,8,0), <a href="sect73.htm">turn to 73</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have picked is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), <a href="sect197.htm">turn to 197</a>.</p>
