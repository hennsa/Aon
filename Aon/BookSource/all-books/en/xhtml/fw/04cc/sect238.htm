<h3>238</h3>

<p>The route Jaeger took yesterday, when he hiked from the well in the mountains to Interstate 8, followed the dry watercourse of the San Cristobal Wash. For him it was a difficult trail to follow on foot, and you soon discover that it is even harder to negotiate in a pick-up truck. The broken ground is deeply rutted and littered with boulders, and progress is painfully slow.</p>
<p>Rather than continue in this direction, you decide to try a more indirect route that takes you west, away from the Wash, across an expanse of desert. By chance you happen upon the remains of a dirt road that winds southwards into the mountains. You stay with this track and, although its surface is far from perfect, you make good time.</p>
<p>At length you reach a ridge that overlooks the well. The site itself is located at the bottom of a bowl-shaped gully, shaded from the sun by two of the Mohawk’s highest peaks. A pump house stands beside the bore-hole, to which is affixed a sign that reads:</p>
<div class="signpost">Luke Air Force Range<br />Garcia Well<br />US. Govt. Property—<em>Keep Out!</em></div>
<p>Carefully you descend, following the dirt road as it zigzags towards the site. You are within a few hundred yards of your destination when you are faced by an unexpected hazard. You take a sharp right bend to find that a section of the road beyond has collapsed. You brake, but the wheels skid on the loose stones and the rear of the truck starts to slide out towards the edge. Frantically you fight to correct the skid as the truck slides nearer and nearer to the edge of the steep ravine.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Driving skill score. Add to this total your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 27 or less, <a href="sect87.htm">turn to 87</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 28 or more, <a href="sect174.htm">turn to 174</a>.</p>
