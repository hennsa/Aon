<h3>244</h3>

<p>In response to your cry, Cutter leaps down from the school bus and throws you a folded blanket as you run towards the blazing Landcruiser. Desperately you shake it open and use it to beat at the flames, which are by now pouring out of a hole in the luggage compartment door. Despite your brave efforts, the flames grow steadily fiercer and you suffer first-degree burns to your hands and forearms. Soon you can tolerate the stinging pain no more and you are forced to retreat: lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Uncle Jonas appears on the scene armed with a fire extinguisher, which he trains on the side of the blazing bus. A thick stream of foam gushes into the hole and arrests the flames just long enough to allow Cutter and a handful of the Tucson colonists to arm themselves with other fire-fighting equipment and put out the fire.</p>
<p>Although you were injured, your bravery and swift response prevented the fire from igniting the vehicle’s fuel tanks. However, there was nothing that could be done to save the contents of the compartment, which included all the colony’s food and the bulk of its water supply.</p>
