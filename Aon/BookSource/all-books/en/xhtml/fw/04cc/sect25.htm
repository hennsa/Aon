<h3>25</h3>

<p>You raise your gun and squeeze the trigger just as the clansman looses off a second burst of fire. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Bullets thud into the side of the car, dangerously close, but you fight the urge to dive for cover. The firing stops, and your adversary clutches at his chest and crumples in a heap in the doorway. Rickenbacker, having finally lost his patience, slams his gun angrily against the front of the car. To his surprise, the sudden impact is just what is needed to dislodge the faulty shell.</p>
<p>Then you hear running footsteps somewhere above and behind you. You turn in time to see two clansmen rushing to take up firing positions on the roof of a nearby bank. You shout a warning and immediately Rickenbacker spins around to face the threat. With no time to take proper aim, the two of you trust to your luck as you spray the parapet of the roof with gunfire (remember to erase an additional round of fire from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>). Your swift action is rewarded: the clansmen are caught in your crossfire before they have you fixed in their sights. With gurgling screams they tumble from the roof of the bank and crash onto the street below.</p>
<p>‘You OK?’ asks Rickenbacker.</p>
<p>‘Sure, jus’ fine,’ you reply, confidently. ‘I guess we’d better check out the bodies, ’n’ make sure they’re Outlaws.’</p>
<p>He nods in agreement and follows as you walk across the street towards the fallen clansmen.</p>
