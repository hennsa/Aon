<h3>253</h3>

<p>You wake late the following morning and open your eyes to the unexpected sight of sunlight streaming in through the window of your room. During the night the dust storm has abated steadily, and now, two hours before noon, the sun once again reigns supreme in the azure skies above Gila Bend. Your first thoughts are of Kate and immediately they spur you into action. Hurriedly you gather up your equipment and run all the way to the school bus.</p>
<p>You enter to find Kate sipping soup from a spoon that Aunt Betty-Ann is holding to her lips. She still looks pale, but at least she is no longer at death’s door. When she sees you she smiles and holds out her hand.</p>
<p>‘How ya doin’, kiddo?’ you say, light-heartedly, and squeeze her fingers, which are cold to the touch.</p>
<p>‘Better … thanks to you,’ she replies. You talk to her while she drinks the last of the soup. Then your aunt goes to the front of the bus and returns with another bowl.</p>
<p>‘Here you go, Cal,’ she says. ‘Have some brunch.’</p>
<p>‘Not mushrooms, I hope,’ you comment, which makes Kate smile.</p>
<p>As you are finishing your meal, Rickenbacker climbs aboard and informs you that the convoy will be leaving in an hour. ‘We’d better get ready, Cal,’ he says. ‘Mike Gorgas wants us to cover point. Macy and Langdon will be the convoy’s rear guard.’</p>
<p>‘OK,’ you reply, as you get ready to leave. You thank your aunt for the food (restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points), and then kiss Kate goodbye before returning with Rickenbacker to your roadster.</p>
