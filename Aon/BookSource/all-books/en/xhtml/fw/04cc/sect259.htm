<h3>259</h3>

<p>You cross the centre of the campsite and follow a paved path that leads to a barbecue area. Several brick-built ranges are dotted around this enclosure, beyond which you can see another log cabin. It is larger than any of the others, and, judging by the faded sign that hangs from its roof, it once served as a restaurant for the site.</p>
<p>As you approach the barbecue area, you see Rickenbacker crouched behind one of the ranges. He is involved in a firefight with the clansman, who is hiding behind another brick range over on the other side, near the restaurant. Rickenbacker fires a long burst, which pulverizes the clansman’s position. His clip finally runs out of ammunition and the clansman leaps away from his bullet-ridden range and sprints towards the restaurant. He is hoping to get there before your partner can reload his gun.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a missile weapon and wish to fire at the clansman, <a href="sect177.htm">turn to 177</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to chase after him, <a href="sect86.htm">turn to 86</a>.</p>
