<h3>285</h3>

<p>Your shot catches one of the clansmen in the side. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) He screams and falls against his partner, who is forced to drop his rifle in order to catch his wounded companion. Rather than fire a second shot, you jump onto the roof and run towards the group. The clansman who is sitting with his back to the parapet sees you approaching, and a wave of fear knots your stomach as you wait expectantly for his shout of alarm. But curiously he does nothing to alert his companions.</p>
<p>Instinct prompts you to act quickly in case he has a change of heart. You rush forward and attack the two riflemen before they can disentangle themselves. Your first blow sends the wounded clansman tumbling over the parapet. Then, before his companion recovers his senses, you jump forward and attack.</p>
