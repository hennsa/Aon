<h3>286</h3>

<p>‘What we need is a diversion,’ says Langdon, ‘something to draw them Outlaws away from their camp. The intersection is in the suburbs of Arizona City, and we figure that if we were to start a fire there, a real big fire mind, then it might jus’ keep ’em interested long enough for the convoy to high-tail it through to I-8.’</p>
<p>‘It’s risky,’ you reply, thoughtfully, ‘but I reckon’ it might jus’ work. Let’s put it to the convoy an’ see what they say.’</p>
<p>Using the Trans-sol’s transceiver, you radio through to Pop Ewell and inform him of the situation. He says he’ll have to consult the others for a decision, but in the meantime, he advises you and the other scouts to head for Eloy and wait there until the convoy arrives.</p>
<p>It takes less than fifteen minutes to reach Eloy. The town is derelict and its once-prosperous stores bear obvious signs of having been looted many times over in the past few months. You park near the centre of town and consider the idea of searching some of the nearby buildings. Although the chance of finding anything of practical use is remote, you have some time to kill: the convoy is not due to arrive here for another two hours.</p>
<p>Looking around at the ruined stores, you note only two that look in any way interesting: an auto repair workshop and a gun store.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the workshop, <a href="sect47.htm">turn to 47</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to search the gun store, <a href="sect99.htm">turn to 99</a>.</p>
