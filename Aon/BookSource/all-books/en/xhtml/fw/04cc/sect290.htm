<h3>290</h3>

<p>Cutter sets fire to a rag and tosses it onto the flat bed of a pick-up truck at the end of the line. There is a loud rush of air—<i>Whumph!</i>—and a brilliant flash of yellow light: the whole line of vehicles is engulfed by a wall of flame.</p>
<p>Through the shimmering heat haze you see the first vehicle in the clan convoy roll to a halt about 200 yards from the blazing barricade. The others stop in line behind it and a swarm of leather-clad clansmen disembark and scurry for cover among the rocks on either side of the freeway. You glance at Kate and force a smile as you slip off your gun’s safety catch and prepare to meet their advance.</p>
<p>‘I’m scared,’ she whispers, her soft voice wavering with fear.</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry,’ you say, reassuringly. ‘We’re gonna make it.’</p>
<p>Then you hear the distant popping of gunfire, and bullets start to whistle and buzz above your head like angry insects. To your right, a group of fellow defenders open fire at a pair of clansmen who have broken cover less than 100 yards away. They are trying to descend the embankment to the railroad track. Bullets kick up the dust all around them but, miraculously, neither is hit.</p>

<p>They reach the rails and run beneath the bridge, disappearing quickly from view. You have turned your attention back to the freeway, and are getting ready to fire your first shot, when suddenly the two clansmen reappear barely ten yards in front of the hollow. Covered by the gradient and the wire-hard scrub, they have approached close enough for you to be able to see the whites of their eyes. The leader steadies himself on the steep slope and draws his pistol. He is staring fixedly at you, leaving you in no doubt that you are his intended target.</p>

<p class="choice">If it is a Rifle, <a href="sect101.htm">turn to 101</a>.</p>
