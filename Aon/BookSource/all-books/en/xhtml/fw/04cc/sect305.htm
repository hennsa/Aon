<h3>305</h3>

<p>You join with Rickenbacker in searching the clansman’s body and deduce, from the tattoos of a big cat found on both his wrists, that he is a Puma clan member.</p>
<p>‘I wonder what he was doing here on his own?’ muses Rickenbacker.</p>
<p>‘I’ve no idea,’ you reply, letting your eyes scan the surrounding campsite for a possible answer. You see nothing unusual, and it is not until you search inside the restaurant cabin that your question finds an answer. There you discover a store of foodstuffs, a secret hoard that the clansman had been keeping from his fellow clan members.</p>
<p>‘The colony sure is gonna appreciate this,’ says Rickenbacker, as he reaches for his radio transceiver. The colony is delighted to hear about your discovery and, while you wait for them to arrive, you take the opportunity to search the rest of the cabin for useful items. Your search uncovers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine Pistol (containing twelve rounds of 9mm ammunition)</li>
<li>Solar Torch</li>
<li>Binoculars</li>
<li>HE Grenade</li>
<li>Enough food for five Meals (separate from hoard)</li>
<li>Rope</li>
<li>Knife (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to keep any of these items, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="sect150.htm">Turn to 150</a>.</p>
