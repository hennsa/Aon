<h3>311</h3>

<p>Rickenbacker pulls the dead clansman off you and helps you up. When you are back on your feet, you look towards the bridge and see the bodies of the other clansmen lying in a tangled heap on the dirt road. They were all dispatched by your partner before they came within ten yards of the ditch.</p>
<p>Together you walk back across the bridge to Cookie and the pick-up truck. The ex-clansman praises your bravery. In his estimation, taking on and defeating six angry Yuma Pumas is nothing short of heroic. Rickenbacker shrugs: ‘All in a day’s work, kid,’ he says, and reaches nonchalantly for his radio transceiver.</p>
<p>Within seconds he is in touch with the convoy and, almost casually, he reports that the bridge across the Gila River is now clear.</p>
