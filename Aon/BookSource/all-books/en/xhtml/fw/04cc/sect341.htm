<h3>341</h3>

<p>Hurriedly the remaining colonists return to the convoy vehicles and begin to leave. Meanwhile, Cutter gathers about him all those who have volunteered to stay and fight. Using a map, and with minutes to spare before Mad Dog’s clansmen are expected to show up, he sketches his plan of action.</p>
<p>Cutter decides that the best place to delay the enemy is at a railroad bridge, located six miles west along Interstate 8 at a place called Round Mountain. Using the DC1 tanker, which is still laden with over 2,000 gallons of gasolene, and a handful of smaller vehicles, Cutter plans to block both freeway lanes and then set fire to the tanker, turning the road block into a blazing barricade.</p>
<p>With the rear-guard volunteers in position on either side of the freeway, some on the slopes of Round Mountain and a few holding the high ground directly opposite, overlooking the bridge, he is confident that you will be able to hold back Mad Dog’s clan long enough for the convoy to reach the safety of Pine Valley.</p>
<p>Once everyone has been briefed, and is aware of the part they are expected to play in this desperate action, the last of the spare weapons and ammunition are distributed among you. You may choose to replenish your supply from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pistol</li>
<li>Rifle</li>
<li>Five rounds of 7.62mm ammunition</li>
<li>Eighteen rounds of 9mm ammunition</li>
<li>Three rounds of 12-gauge ammunition</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Weapons List</a> and/or Ammo Pouch accordingly.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect220.htm">turn to 220</a>.</p>
