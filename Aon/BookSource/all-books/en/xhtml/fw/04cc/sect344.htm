<h3>344</h3>

<p>You stop near the service bay and leave your engine running while you investigate the office of the gas station. A wire rack full of age-yellowed maps looks promising, but all it contains are Arizona road maps and tourist route planners. You rifle the drawers of the office cabinets and, although you find no town map, you do discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar Torch</li>
<li>Tool Kit</li>
<li>Bolt Cutters</li>
</ul>
<p>As you turn to leave, you notice a town map pasted to the back of the door by which you entered. Your spirits rise when you see that the hospital is just one block east along Highway 84.</p>
<p>At last your luck seems to have changed for the better. You climb back into your car and drive for less than a minute before the entrance of the Casa Grande General Hospital appears on your right. Expectantly you enter the grounds and park your car among the rows of derelict autos that fill the front lot. The main entrance lobby is lit by fluorescent light, so you decide to enter by a side door in case the hospital is occupied by clansmen.</p>
<p>Cautiously you follow a dimly lit corridor that echoes with the mesmeric hum of a generator running somewhere on a lower level of the building. The corridor is well signposted but none indicates the location of the medicine storage facility. At length you reach a junction and are faced with a choice of turning left towards the X-ray department, or turning right towards the administration offices.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to follow the corridor to the left, <a href="sect324.htm">turn to 324</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to follow the corridor to the right, <a href="sect198.htm">turn to 198</a>.</p>
