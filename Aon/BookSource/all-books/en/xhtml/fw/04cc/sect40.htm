<h3>40</h3>

<p>Cookie informs you that the convoy could make a successful crossing at the Imperial Reservoir, located on the Colorado River ten miles to the northwest of Dome. Your <a href="map.htm">map</a> confirms its location, but no highways are shown and you doubt that the convoy’s heavy vehicles would be able to cross there safely, if at all.</p>
<p>Cookie is insistent that it is possible, and, after much deliberation, the colony leaders agree to try. The convoy sets off immediately for Ligurta, a town on Interstate 8 that you checked thoroughly on your return from Yuma earlier this morning. The town is still empty, so the convoy halts here. Driving the clan pick-up truck that you discovered parked behind the cinema last night, Rickenbacker, Cookie, and yourself leave Ligurta to scout the tiny town of Dome. It is empty, but two miles beyond it you find that the bridge across the Gila River is guarded by a Puma patrol.</p>
