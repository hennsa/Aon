<h3>45</h3>

<p>You resume your position at the head of the convoy, scouting two miles ahead of the column as it trundles west along Interstate 8. The sun is low on the horizon and the temperature is cooling to a comfortable 70 degrees as you approach the small town of Tacna. You slow down and check for evidence of clan activity but, like all the towns you have passed through since Gila Bend, this one is derelict and deserted.</p>
<p>You continue and, a short while later, you see the outline of Wellton in the distance, its buildings dark against the orange glow of the setting sun. The town looks empty and you approach without slowing. Fatigue, coupled with the ease with which you have passed through the previous towns, has filled you with a false sense of security. Unfortunately, your carelessness is punished when, within seconds of entering the town’s main street, your roadster comes under fire from someone positioned on the roof of a large building to your right.</p>
<p>Bullets ricochet off the hood and strike sparks in a line along the armoured plating that protects your door. Then there is a sharp <i>bang</i> and the steering suddenly feels heavy, warning you at once that one of your front tyres has been shot out.</p>
<p>Add together your Driving skill score and your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is 24 or less, <a href="sect187.htm">turn to 187</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 25–30, <a href="sect165.htm">turn to 165</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 31 or more, <a href="sect274.htm">turn to 274</a>.</p>
