<h3>5</h3>

<p>Snatching the front of your T-shirt to your mouth, you manage to control the dizziness long enough to stagger away from the edge of the platform and escape from the cloud of tear gas. As your vision clears you see that you are not the only one who has been affected by the gas. On the other side of the roof, the clansmen are doubled up on the ground, coughing and retching violently. You draw a close combat weapon and move stealthily towards the group, hoping to reach the clansmen before the effects of the gas wear off. The clansman who was seated sees you approaching but, curiously, does nothing to alert his companions.</p>
<p>You act quickly in case he has a change of heart. Rushing forward, you get your forearm around the throat of the nearest clansman and pull him up from the ground. He drops his rifle over the edge of the parapet and, as you pull him towards you, his partner picks up his gun and fires in panic. The burst of fire kills the clansman instantly, but you survive, shielded by his body. Shocked by what he has done, the clansman freezes, his watery eyes wide with disbelief as his companion slumps dead at your feet. Before he recovers his senses, you jump forward and kick the assault rifle out of his hands, sending it sailing over the parapet to join the other gun. Before it hits the ground you press home your advantage and attack.</p>
