<h3>61</h3>

<p>As you drive nearer, Rickenbacker takes up his machine pistol in expectation of trouble. The clansman appears to be alone, and you notice that there is only one motorcycle parked beside the cabin from which he emerged. This cabin stands at the entrance to what was once a state-run campsite.</p>
<p>After only a few seconds, the clansman’s smile wears thin, to be replaced by a look of horror the moment he realizes that you are not what you seem. With a cry of anguish he turns and runs through the campsite entrance.</p>
<p>‘He’s seen us,’ hisses Rickenbacker. ‘Quick Cal, let’s get him before he gets away!’ Hurriedly you put your foot down and drive through the entrance way. Beyond lies a cluster of log cabins, grouped in a horseshoe formation around a central parking area. As you squeal to a halt, the clansman is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>‘We’ve gotta find him … and quick!’ says Rickenbacker, leaping from the passenger door. ‘You search one side of the camp and I’ll search the other.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the cabins on the south side of the campsite, <a href="sect120.htm">turn to 120</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the cabins on the north side of the campsite, <a href="sect323.htm">turn to 323</a>.</p>
