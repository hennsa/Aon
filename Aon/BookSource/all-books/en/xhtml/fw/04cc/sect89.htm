<h3>89</h3>

<p>You draw a close combat weapon and steel yourself to cross the roof. It is a daring attack, but at least you have the benefit of darkness and surprise.</p>
<p>As you move stealthily towards the group, the clansman who is sitting with his back to the parapet sees you approaching. A wave of fear knots your stomach as expectantly you wait for him to shout out in alarm, but he does nothing to alert his companions.</p>
<p>Instinct prompts you to act quickly in case he has a change of heart. Rushing forward, you get your forearm around the throat of the nearest shooter, and then wrench him away from the parapet. He drops his rifle over the edge and, as you pull him towards you, his partner turns and fires in panic. The burst of fire kills the clansman instantly, but you survive, shielded by his body. Shocked by what he has done, the clansman freezes, his eyes wide with disbelief, as his companion slumps dead at your feet. Before he recovers his senses, you jump forward and kick the assault rifle out of his hands, sending it sailing over the parapet. Before it hits the ground, you press home your advantage and attack.</p>

<p>Owing to the surprise of the attack, ignore any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point losses that you sustain in the first two rounds of combat.</p>
