<h3>9</h3>

<p>Despite the threat of pursuit by the Outlaws, the convoy covers just fourteen miles before it grinds to a halt at the outskirts of a town called Aztec. Two of the seventeen colony vehicles have broken down due to shrapnel damage sustained during the clan attack, and a further three are on the verge of doing likewise. With night closing in, and the road ahead yet to be scouted, the colony can do little more than draw itself up in a tight, protective circle and wait for dawn to arrive. You must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>At first light, you, Rickenbacker, Macy, and Langdon are sent to scout the freeway and search for food and water. Meanwhile, Cutter oversees the repair of the vehicles. He is aided by Avenal and Rex Tyler, who have both been completely exonerated of Mike Gorgas’ murder. Cutter estimates that the repairs will take four hours, giving you enough time to check and search Aztec, Dateland, and Mohawk, the next three towns along Interstate 8.</p>
<p>Aztec has been so badly ravaged by the post-holocaust storms that you decide not to bother searching its ruins, and instead you press on to Dateland. This town has fared little better, although you do chance across a shopping precinct on the east side of the town that looks promising. You decide between you that one team should stay here and search these stores while the other one continues along the freeway and scouts Mohawk, fourteen miles to the west.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish stay here at Dateland and search for supplies for the colony, <a href="sect246.htm">turn to 246</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to continue along the freeway to Mohawk and search there, <a href="sect152.htm">turn to 152</a>.</p>
