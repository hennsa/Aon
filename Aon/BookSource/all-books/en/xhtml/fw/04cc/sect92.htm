<h3>92</h3>

<p>The grenade passes over the truck and explodes, throwing little but dust and shrapnel into the air. The dull boom alerts the other clansmen and suddenly all hell breaks loose. They leap to their feet and come running across the bridge, cursing and fumbling for their weapons as they do so. You hobble to the truck and take cover as Rickenbacker, hoping to buy you the precious seconds you need in order to destroy the radio transceiver, opens fire at the approaching clansmen.</p>
<p>As you move along the side of the truck, you notice a keg of blasting powder resting in the back with a self-lighting fuse attached to its top. Rather than attempting to batter the radio to pieces, you decide to blow it up instead. A sharp tug is all that is required to set off the fuse; then you run towards Rickenbacker as fast as your aching foot will allow. As you jump into the ditch, there is a jarring boom and a brilliant flash of bright orange flame as the truck explodes.</p>
<p>‘What the heck … !’ gasps Rickenbacker, stunned by the unexpected force of the second explosion.</p>
<p>‘They had a keg of blasting powder in the back,’ you cry, shouting to make yourself heard above the rumbling echo of the explosion. ‘So I pulled the fuse!’</p>
<p>As the dust clears, the clansmen struggle to their feet and run towards the blazing remains of their truck. As they get nearer, you take up your gun and prepare to open fire.<sup><a href="#sect92-1-foot" name="sect92-1">5</a></sup></p>
