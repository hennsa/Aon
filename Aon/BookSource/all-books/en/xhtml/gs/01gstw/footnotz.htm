<h2>Footnotes</h2>


<div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-2">1</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/sect175.htm">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, then you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point you lack (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point). If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score.</p>
</div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-1">2</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="powers.htm#powers-1">3</a>]  (<a href="powers.htm">Magical Powers</a>) If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero.

The Jewelled Dagger’s bonus to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> should only be applied when the Jewelled Dagger is used in combat. You should not use your Wizard’s Staff at the same time. This would incur the normal −6 penalty to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for not using your Wizard’s Staff.</p><p>Alternatively, you may decide that the Jewelled Dagger may be wielded together with your Wizard’s Staff, and thus confers its bonus in all close combats. This makes the Jewelled Dagger a much more useful item.</p>
