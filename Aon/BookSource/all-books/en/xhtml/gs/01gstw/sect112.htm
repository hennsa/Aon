<h3>112</h3>

<p>You steer for the harbour and, as you near the stone quayside, you stand to furl the sail. You cut a dramatic figure: hair flowing in the wind; the reddening glow of the setting sun at your back, casting your shadow upon the shallow waters of the Sea of Dreams.</p>
<p>The harbour is very busy; crowds of people rush to and fro. Sailors and fishermen line the harbour wall, busily unloading their crafts in an effort to finish before nightfall. You notice a flurry of activity further along the quayside; by the time you reach it, a small crowd has gathered, and you can hear the murmur of excited conversation. You throw up a rope and eager hands reach out to clutch the line, mooring the boat for you.</p>
<p>The crowd has grown and it is now obvious that you are the focus of their attention. You hear snatches of conversation: ‘An Ancient One, an Ancient One from beyond the Sea of Dreams … ’; ‘See you there? Surely a Shianti walks amongst us?’; ‘Saw him myself. Came right out of the east, calm as you please!’; ‘God of legend, saviour of our people, hail, hail!’</p>
<p>Hands stretch out in greeting while others try desperately to touch your robe, pushing and pulling, as more and more people struggle for a glimpse of your face. ‘Who but a god could cross the Sea of Dreams. Save us, Lord!’ the crowd begins to shout. ‘Destroy the evil Shadakine. Throw down the Wytch-king!’</p>
<p>You can feel the growing hysteria, and to your dismay, you are lifted up on the shoulders of some of the crowd and carried in the direction of two armed soldiers, who are rushing towards you with their swords drawn.</p>
<p>‘Destroy the Shadakine warriors, Lord!’ someone shouts.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to do as the crowd suggests, <a href="sect84.htm">turn to 84</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to escape the crowd and the Shadakine warriors and possess the Magical Power of Enchantment, <a href="sect56.htm">turn to 56</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather try to escape without the aid of magic, <a href="sect28.htm">turn to 28</a>.</p>
