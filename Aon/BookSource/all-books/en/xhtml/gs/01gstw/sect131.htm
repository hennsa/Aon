<h3>131</h3>

<p>You strike up a conversation with the red-faced merchant. His name is Shan Li, a trader familiar with all parts of the Shadakine Empire and many strange lands beyond. Carefully, you steer the conversation to the subject of the Lost Tribe of Lara.</p>
<p>‘Ah now,’ begins the drunken merchant with some relish, ‘the legend, eh? Well, there are many stories, and in my travels I have heard most of them. No word of the Laranese have I ever heard in the far north, the free kingdoms of the Lastlands, nor here in the Shadakine Empire. No indeed, the only story I ever heard that seemed authentic came to me in the city of Elzian where I was trading with the Magicians of Dessi. There I heard a story of the exile of the Lost Tribe to the cloud forests of the far south, that perilous place named the Azanam. Others, though, speak of the forested Shuri Mountains.’</p>
<p>In a very loud voice, the merchant begins relating one of the many stories he has heard about the Laranese. You notice that many people are turning to stare, muttering and whispering. Before you can attempt to quieten him, a hand grabs your shoulder. You and the merchant have been arrested by four burly Shadakine guards.</p>
