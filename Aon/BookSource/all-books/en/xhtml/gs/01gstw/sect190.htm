<h3>190</h3>

<p>‘We go south,’ you say to Shan.</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ he replies. ‘I only pray that I am not leading you on a fool’s errand.’</p>
<p>‘With you leading, what else could it be?’ says Tanith under her breath, smiling sweetly at Shan. Within minutes, the two are trading curses and insults.</p>
<p>‘We have no time for this,’ you admonish them. ‘Shan, lead the way.’ Abashed, he obeys.</p>
<p>‘At the heart of this forest,’ he says, ‘the Suhni River is joined by the Azan River. The Azan River will lead us all the way to this Azanam. We have a choice of two routes to the Azan. North of here is the Suhni River, which leads west, finally merging with the Azan. South lies the Great Suhn Road, which we left last night; it crosses the Azan further south. Which way, Grey Star?’</p>
<p>Consult the <a href="map.htm">map</a> before making your decision.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to find the Azan River by travelling first north and then west, following the Suhni River, <a href="sect38.htm">turn to 38</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather travel first south and then west along the Great Suhn Road, <a href="sect21.htm">turn to 21</a>.</p>
