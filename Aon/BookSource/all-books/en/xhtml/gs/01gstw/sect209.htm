<h3>209</h3>

<p>You speak to the man shrouded in shadow, noting the wooden, fish-shaped amulet hung around his neck. This is the symbol of the silent order of ‘Redeemers’, a religious sect persecuted throughout the Shadakine Empire, though their purposes remain a mystery.</p>
<p>Instead of replying, the black-robed pilgrim puts a finger to his lips and hands you two items: a vial, containing a Pink Liquid, and a Medallion, inscribed with a rune. If you wish to keep these items, mark the Vial of Pink Liquid as a Backpack Item and the Medallion as a Special Item (worn around your neck) on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Before you can examine these items more closely, four Shadakine warriors burst into the inn. They seem to be looking for someone. Without a word, the ‘Redeemer’ leaves.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a mug of ale is placed in front of you. The affable merchant sitting opposite has bought you a drink; he is shouting a happy greeting to you and asking your name.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accept the drink, <a href="sect131.htm">turn to 131</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather leave the inn, <a href="sect157.htm">turn to 157</a>.</p>
