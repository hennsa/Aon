<h3>250</h3>

<p>Since the corpse of the Shianti priest is still in the dungeon with you, you decide to summon his departed spirit and ask for its aid. With a wedge of rock, you scratch out a ragged pentacle in the dirt of the dungeon floor. Taking a deep breath, you slowly and carefully fall into a trance state. You focus on the body of the dead priest, sending out an echoing call to the spiritual plane. Your mind fills with the groaning cries of disembodied spirits and visions of phantoms with strange, pale faces.</p>
<p>Shan the merchant backs away in terror as the translucent Shade of the old priest materializes above its discarded, earthly body, shimmering with a silvery light that illuminates the darkness of the cell. ‘I have come, Grey Star,’ the Shade says in a hollow voice. ‘My aid I give thee, but you must pay the price of the dead if I am to free you. Wilt thou pay this price?’</p>
<p>Your heart is full of fear as you realize that you must agree to the dead man’s price without knowing what it will be.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accept the dead priest’s bargain, <a href="sect326.htm">turn to 326</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you feel that you must refuse, <a href="sect305.htm">turn to 305</a>.</p>
