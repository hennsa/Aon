<h3>251</h3>

<p>Just as the two soldiers break through the wall of injured and fleeing people, the illusion takes effect.</p>
<p>‘Let me down. Let me down!’ an old woman croaks angrily. The approaching warriors and those who carry you on their shoulders stare at you in disbelief. You have transformed yourself into an old woman carrying a walking stick, or at least that is what the others see.</p>
<p>‘Torment a poor old woman would you?’ you screech, thumping those nearby on the back, slapping a few heads and tweaking an ear or two before prodding a Shadakine warrior with your Staff. ‘And as for you,’ you cry indignantly, ‘have you no shame? Order this rabble to let me down and show some respect for a woman of my years.’ With this, you begin another shower of slaps and thumps to the great amusement of the Shadakine.</p>
<p>Slowly, you are lowered to the ground. Grumbling, you hobble away while puzzled and suspicious eyes look on. However, the Shadakine Warriors are completely fooled, slapping their thighs and roaring with laughter as the stunned crowd disperses in angry silence. A sense of unrest emanates from those who remain behind, and you know that you must leave the harbour area quickly, before your illusion is challenged. An illusion is easily dispelled by one who disbelieves in the image or picture that Enchantment places in the mind, and a visual illusion is hard to maintain for long periods, as details tend to fade and waver after a time, losing their consistency and revealing flaws to the cynical observer.</p>
<p class="choice">If you want to leave by the main entrance to the harbour, <a href="sect50.htm">turn to 50</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would prefer to turn into a dark, narrow street leading from the harbour area, <a href="sect40.htm">turn to 40</a>.</p>
