<h3>297</h3>

<p>Using the straw of the dungeon floor to make a small fire which Shan lights by striking two stones together, you heat the mixture until the crystals have completely dissolved. You plug the stopper into the vial and shake it vigorously. When you are satisfied that the yellow potion is well mixed, you walk over to the door and sprinkle a little of the contents on the lock. A small cloud of yellow gas forms.</p>
<p>Shan looks on, impressed, as the metal of the lock begins to bubble and melt. You have used only half of the potion, and the lock is already eaten away. You may keep the remainder of the potion in your Herb Pouch for future use. (Mark this on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as Ezeran Acid in the appropriate section.) However, you have used all your Sulphur and Saltpetre to make the potion. (Remember to erase these from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, although you may keep the two empty Vials, which still count as items, in your Herb Pouch.<sup><a href="#sect297-1-foot" name="sect297-1">35</a></sup>)</p>
<p>The remnants of the lock fall away, and you push the door open. You and Shan step quietly into a corridor leading to the left and the right.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go right, <a href="sect23.htm">turn to 23</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go left, <a href="sect333.htm">turn to 333</a>.</p>
