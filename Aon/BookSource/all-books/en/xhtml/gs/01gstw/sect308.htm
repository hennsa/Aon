<h3>308</h3>

<p>Taking a deep breath, you plunge into the seething mass and attempt to confront the Shadakine before more people are hurt. Buffeted and crushed by the confused and frightened Suhnese, rushing in all directions, you fight your way to the heart of the chaos.</p>
<p>Through a gap in the crowd you sight the two soldiers, blindly slashing at the terrified crowd. You are standing directly behind them, but the Shadakine are too close to other members of the crowd for you to risk launching an energy bolt from your Staff. Without hesitation, you charge into the fray, Staff whirling above your head. You catch the two warriors completely unawares as you attack them from behind, spurred on by a rousing cheer from the crowd. Owing to the surprise of your attack, add 4 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of this combat, remembering to deduct them again as soon as the fight is over.</p>
<p>The Shadakine swing at you with their deadly, gleaming scimitars. You must fight them as one enemy.</p>
<p class="combat">Shadakine Warriors: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 20   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 19</p>
<p class="choice">If you win, <a href="sect127.htm">turn to 127</a>.</p>
