<h3>347</h3>

<p>Head bent low, you hurl yourself into the narrow tunnel. It slopes upwards, becoming narrower as it winds and curls like a snake. Ahead you see a lone worker Mantiz coming towards you, holding a large leaf in its pincers. Without hesitation, you dive over the Cave Mantiz, scraping your back against the walls and ceiling of the converging tunnels. A gout of acid misses your body by inches as you tumble to the ground on the other side of the insect. You roll over twice before leaping to your feet once more.</p>
<p>Countless numbers of snapping, malicious insects pursue you, but far ahead you see a dim light which fills you with hope. A faint gust of air blows against your cheek, making you certain that this tunnel connects with the surface. You focus on the dim light and force your aching legs to propel you onwards.</p>
<p>As you draw nearer the flood of light, you see that the tunnel ends at a blank wall. Your spirits sink: are you trapped after all?</p>
