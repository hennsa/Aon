<h3>38</h3>

<p>For three days you trace a path along the Suhni River as it winds through the heart of the forest. You carry no provisions, but Tanith is able to provide food for you all. She displays an uncanny control over animals, calling to the mesmerized creatures in a strange language and then coolly wringing their necks.</p>
<p>On your journey, you manage to avoid the frequent Shadakine patrols that dog your path, and as you are not required to use any magic, you may restore 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> and 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your current totals.</p>
<p>You discover clumps of the Laumspur herb growing along the river and decide to pick some of it. If you have the Magical Power of Alchemy, you may store it in your Herb Pouch. Remember to mark the Laumspur on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. Swallowing it will regain 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If you do not have the Power of Alchemy, you must swallow the Laumspur while it is fresh to regain 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points and may not store it.</p>
<p>As you are picking the Laumspur, three Shadakine warriors burst out of the forest. You have been ambushed.</p>
