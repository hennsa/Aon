<h3>52</h3>

<p>You wake the following morning, drained and depressed. Your traumatic experience has caused you to lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point during your sleep.</p>
<p>‘We must go on,’ insists Shan, ‘to make her sacrifice worthwhile.’</p>
<p>You know he is right, and wearily, you get to your feet and pull on your Backpack to continue your journey. ‘We will reach the Azagad Gorge this afternoon if we set a good pace,’ says Shan.</p>
<p>As the sun reaches its zenith, you notice how hot and humid the atmosphere has become. The plains of the Wilderwastes are now barren: a dry desert of ugly rocks and boulders stretches before you. You have many more days of travelling ahead of you and your food supplies are running low. The Azan River begins to narrow as you draw nearer to Lake Shenwu, the source of the river, lying beneath the Wall of Azakawa and the Shenwu Falls. Beyond that, lies the Azanam, home of the Lost Tribe of Lara.</p>
<p>Shan draws your attention to a wooden shack to the east. It is a strange sight so far from civilization.</p>

<p class="choice">If you would rather continue your journey, <a href="sect227.htm">turn to 227</a>.</p>
