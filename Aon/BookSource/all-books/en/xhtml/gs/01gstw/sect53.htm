<h3>53</h3>

<p>You do not wish to arouse the fisherman’s suspicions any further. For this reason, you are unable to bring about the necessary state of meditation that enables you to see into the future. Instead, you reach out with your senses in an effort to determine the fisherman’s true nature. Totally unaware of your intentions, he continues to haggle over the price of the boat as you probe the invisible aura that surrounds him.</p>
<p>You sense that the one-eyed man means you no harm. He is the harbour watchman, a petty con-man who prowls round the harbour, spying on the illegal actions of smugglers and shady traders whom he then forces to buy his silence. He is offering you half the true value of your boat. However, your Power of Prophecy tells you that you might be glad of some money in the near future, and this may be your only chance of gaining some. You allow the watchman to cheat you.</p>
<p>The use of this Magical Power has cost you 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point.</p>
