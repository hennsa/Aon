<h3>66</h3>

<p>Even before you can lift your Staff, a crossbow bolt flies past your head and plunges into the neck of the Shadakine warrior, who falls with a surprised look on his brutal face. The officer and his men hoot with laughter at the plight of their own comrade.</p>
<p>While the first crossbowman reloads, the other looses a bolt at you. The arrow burrows painfully into your shoulder and you lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. At the expense of 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point you fire a blast at the bowman; he falls dead. The first crossbowman has now reloaded and you know that the odds on your surviving another bolt are very slim. Even if you manage to kill the crossbowman, you will have to fight the officer, and already your shoulder is beginning to stiffen. You are unlikely to be able to fight well in your present state.</p>
<p>You surrender to the Shadakine, throwing yourself at their mercy: a quality they seem rather short of.</p>
