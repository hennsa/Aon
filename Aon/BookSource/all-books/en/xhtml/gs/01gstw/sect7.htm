<h3>7</h3>

<p>You learn that the girl’s name is Tanith. She is a novice in the ways of witchcraft and is in the service of Mother Magri, her protector and guardian. She is very beautiful and has long, dark, unkempt hair and wild green eyes. ‘They say that you are a wizard and that you challenged the truthsay of the Kazim Stone,’ she says, curiously.</p>
<p>‘Of course,’ you reply, a little boastfully, wishing to impress this ragged but winsome creature.</p>
<p>‘That is very bad,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘Mother Magri will have you tortured. The ways of the Shadaki are very cruel. Tonight, you will be taken to the Darkling Room and you will experience great pain and terror.’</p>
<p>‘Then I must escape this place,’ you say, fearfully. ‘Can you help me?’</p>
<p>Tanith gazes at you, a frightened expression on her face. ‘No … No … The danger … I cannot … I dare not!’ She takes a dried flower from the pocket of her dress, and sprinkles its powdered petals into your food. ‘This will help fortify you before your ordeal,’ she explains, her voice trembling. ‘I can do no more.’</p>
<p>She jumps to her feet. ‘I’m sorry … ’ She falters, a longing note in her voice, and then she disappears.</p>
