<h3>88</h3>

<p>The bolt of force that arcs through the air into the ranks of Shadakine warriors kills one of them at a cost to you of 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. The knights gain ground at their opponents’ expense due to the confusion of the Shadakine, who are now being attacked from the front and rear.</p>
<p>The distance over which you are fighting necessitates the use of a great deal of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, and you realize that you can only increase your effectiveness by moving closer to the Shadakine. An attack from the rear at this time would almost certainly turn the battle in your favour. With this in mind, you burst out of the undergrowth and charge into the battle with a fearsome yell. Shan, puffing and panting behind you, swings his sword feebly. The knights on the bridge give a rousing cheer as you appear, and the Shadakine are pushed back as their resistance begins to falter. And then you are upon them: you rain blows in all directions, throwing them into disorder and wounding a warrior at the cost of 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point.<sup><a href="#sect88-1-foot" name="sect88-1">13</a></sup></p>

<p>[<a name="sect88-1-foot" href="#sect88-1">13</a>] If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative. Alternatively, you may choose the method used in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/sect175.htm">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a> for resolving this problem: For the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you lack, you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point).</p></div>
