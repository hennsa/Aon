<h3>91</h3>

<p>You bring your Staff down on the creature’s unprotected rump. Its legs curl and crumple beneath it. At the cost of 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point, you kill the insect.</p>
<p>Close inspection reveals the insect to be a Cave Mantiz. The Cave Mantiz live in colonies below ground in much the same way as their cousins the ants. They burrow their nests from the stone by dissolving it with a potent acid that they store in their bodies. You have entered a Mantiz nest, and despite the perils therein, you are greatly encouraged. If you can find your way through the maze of Mantiz tunnels, you should be able to reach the surface above the Wall of Azakawa and enter the Azanam.</p>
<p>Your excitement is tinged with apprehension as you continue along a tunnel that is growing darker and darker. If you wish to expend 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point on lighting your Staff, you may: this light will last until you extinguish it without the use of any further <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. If you have a Torch and Tinderbox, you may wish to use the Torch for light.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to proceed in darkness, <a href="sect122.htm">turn to 122</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you prefer to light your way, <a href="sect141.htm">turn to 141</a>.</p>
