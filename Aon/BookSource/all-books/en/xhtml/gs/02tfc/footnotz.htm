<h2>Footnotes</h2>


<div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-1">1</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) If you have completed <cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite>, your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score will be zero before you begin this book. It doesn’t seem fair to start this book with only 10 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, so you may choose to create a new <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score by choosing a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and adding 20. You may also choose to add the 10 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point bonus to this new score.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use your original <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score from the beginning of <cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite>, and add 10 bonus points to this.</p>
</div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-2">2</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) If you choose Alchemy as your new Magical Power, you also receive a Herb Pouch with contents, as detailed in the <a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a> section.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-4">3</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/sect175.htm">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, then you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point you lack (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point). If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score.</p>
</div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-3">4</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="powers.htm#powers-1">5</a>]  (<a href="powers.htm">Magical Powers</a>) If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-1">6</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) If you have mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy and therefore have a Herb Pouch, you may choose to keep potions, vials, or ingredients in either the Herb Pouch or your Backpack. All other Backpack Items must be kept in your Backpack.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-2">7</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) The Collector’s Editions of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books clarify that ‘You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.’</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect45.htm#sect45-1">8</a>]  (<a href="sect45.htm">Section 45</a>) After taking the Karmo potion and fighting your opponent, halve your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> and <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> scores. It is at your discretion whether you should apply the penalty to your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> before or after halving your score. The former option is the most beneficial.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect91.htm#sect91-1">9</a>]  (<a href="sect91.htm">Section 91</a>) You are forced to choose to use a Magical Power, even though all the Powers that are available to you may require you to use more <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points than you currently possess. If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose to simply subtract the number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points required to use the Power you select. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative. Alternatively, you may choose the method used in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/sect175.htm">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a> for resolving this problem: For the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you lack, you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point).</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect112.htm#sect112-1">10</a>]  (<a href="sect112.htm">Section 112</a>) Remember to deduct the total from your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score before continuing your adventure.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect133.htm#sect133-1">11</a>]  (<a href="sect133.htm">Section 133</a>) If you wish to take the Sheath, record it as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect136.htm#sect136-1">12</a>]  (<a href="sect136.htm">Section 136</a>) Remember to deduct the total from your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score before continuing your adventure.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect148.htm#sect148-1">13</a>]  (<a href="sect148.htm">Section 148</a>) If you have not already done so, mark the Black Rod as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect162.htm#sect162-1">14</a>]  (<a href="sect162.htm">Section 162</a>) As you have used your Power of Evocation against the Deathgaunts, you should deduct 3 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points (cf. <a href="sect120.htm">Section 120</a>).</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect206.htm#sect206-1">15</a>]  (<a href="sect206.htm">Section 206</a>) If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points.
