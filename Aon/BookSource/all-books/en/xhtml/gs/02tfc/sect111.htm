<h3>111</h3>

<p>‘The land beyond the Mountains of Morn, the region that is called Desolation Valley, was once the heart of a great kingdom, a nation called Taklakot. One day, a mighty wizard came amongst them, and he bore a great gift—so they thought. It was a magical stone which harnessed the fire of the sun. The people of Taklakot grew in knowledge but it was a power gained without wisdom and a great calamity befell them. Somehow, the fire of the Sun stone was released and in a single day an entire race was wiped from the face of the world. The barren land you see around you is the result of that fateful day; its curse still lingers.’</p>
<p>‘But what of the Forbidden City? Why does it still stand?’ asks Samu.</p>
<p>‘The mountains that surround the valley held the blast. The Forbidden City, or Gyanima as it was called, stands beyond those mountains. It was built to guard the pass through the mountains and is the only remnant of a dead civilization.’ A greedy light gleams in Hugi’s eyes. ‘The value of its treasures is immeasurable,’ he breathes.</p>
<p>Your Shianti training and lifestyle have taught you to place no value on material wealth and you soon lose interest in Hugi’s tales of hidden gold. Once more, you ponder the incredible bleakness of the place. You gaze across the Belzar River, and to the hills beyond, and an involuntary shiver runs down your spine. Drifting down from the hills, you see an eerie, chilling sight. A ghostly, pallid form floats across the river, its hands outstretched towards you; it whispers with a voice like grating stone.</p>
