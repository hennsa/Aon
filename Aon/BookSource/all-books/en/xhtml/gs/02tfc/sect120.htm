<h3>120</h3>

<p>‘Old Kundi have idea,’ says Urik, suddenly. He produces a small hollow sphere of metal, which is attached to a short metal chain. ‘Give me Azawood leaf!’ he demands. He places the Azawood leaf inside the hollow sphere and asks you to light it with your Staff. As the smoke of the slow-burning leaf begins to drift up from holes in the sphere, he whirls the ball above his head. You see his plan, recalling that, with a similar device, the Kundi men saved you from certain death when the Cave Mantiz attacked you in the cloud forest of the Azanam.</p>
<p>Urik steps outside the circle of protection and begins to advance on the Deathgaunts. Immediately, they step back in fear of the cloud of smoke that Urik is carrying towards them. As they retreat, Urik breaks into a shambling run and plunges into their midst. With a fearful moan, the Deathgaunts fade and Urik shouts in triumph.</p>
<p>You have used 3 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points through the use of Evocation, and one Azawood leaf. Adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
