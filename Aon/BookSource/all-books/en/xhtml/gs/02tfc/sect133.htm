<h3>133</h3>

<p>That night, the streets of Karnali are filled with joyous celebration. The surviving Shadakine are flushed out from their bolt-holes and imprisoned in the dungeons beneath their own fortress. It is a great victory for the brave fighters of the Freedom Guild, for at last, after many years of oppression, the people in this small corner of the Shadakine Empire are free.</p>
<p>In a chamber in the Shadakine fortress, you sit with Urik and Sado of the Long Knife, who toasts you with a huge goblet of wine. ‘To you, Grey Star,’ he says, ‘I give my thanks and good wishes. Long may you endure.’</p>
<p>But Urik sits in the corner and grumbles: ‘Much celebration. Small victory. Shadakine Empire,’ and he stretches his arms wide apart, ‘<em>big</em>!’ Then placing his thumb and forefinger together, ‘City of Karnali, small.’</p>
<p>‘Urik is right,’ you say, ‘but at least this is a beginning.’ And you smile warmly at Sado.</p>
<p>‘Where will you go now, Grey Star?’ he asks.</p>
<p>‘West, to the Mountains of Morn—and beyond.’</p>
<p>Sado gapes. ‘To “the dead lands”!’ he exclaims. ‘But this is folly. None return from there. There is a sickness on the land that kills all, and the Mountains of Morn are impassable.’</p>
<p>‘There must be some way through them,’ you say, ‘and I will find it.’</p>
<p>‘There is only one known pass,’ Sado continues, ‘but it holds the greatest peril of all—Gyanima, the Forbidden City … the City of the Dead!’ He shakes his head solemnly. ‘Will you not turn away from this reckless course?’</p>
<p>You shrug. ‘There is no other way. Urik’s vision leads to Desolation Valley and my quest takes me there.’</p>
<p>Sado falls silent and an uncomfortable quiet follows. Finally, you rise and bid Sado goodnight, for you intend to leave Karnali the following morning. ‘I had hoped you would remain, Grey Star,’ he says. ‘You are a powerful ally and I have great need of strength. Soon, the Wytch-king will seek to destroy our freedom. Without your help, our liberty may prove short-lived. Moreover, you choose a path of doom, heedless of my words of warning.’</p>
<p>‘Fear not, Sado of the Long Knife,’ you reply. ‘If I achieve my goal, there will be freedom for all ensnared by the cruel grasp of the Wytch-king. I do not intend to fail.’</p>
<p>You leave the chamber, and close the door behind you. Despite your courageous words, a creeping uncertainty is stirring in your heart. ‘Hmph!’ snorts Urik. ‘Him brave man … but have small mind.’ He places a finger to his nose. ‘Him see only this far. Young Wizard learn quickly … carry blessing of wise Shianti. You will not fail.’ You pray that the old Kundi man is right.</p>
<p>You rise the following morning and prepare to leave. Your sleep has restored to you 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point and 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point. Sado enters your chamber to bid you farewell. ‘I have come to apologize for my harsh words last night,’ he says. ‘It is not for me to question the way of Wizards. I am but a simple soldier. I have brought gifts by way of recompense.’ He lays before you the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enough food for 5 Meals</li>
<li>Short Sword and Sheath (hung on a belt)<sup><a href="#sect133-1-foot" name="sect133-1">11</a></sup></li>
<li>Backpack</li>
<li>2 Potions of Laumspur (swallowing one potion restores 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points)</li>
<li>Coil of Rope</li>
</ul>
