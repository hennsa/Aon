<h3>164</h3>

<p>You remove the long sturdy Rope from your Backpack and tie it around your waist. ‘If I should fall, haul me up,’ you say. Samu nods. ‘We’ll do the same for you on the other side.’</p>
<p>With your heart in your mouth, you run across the bridge; you feel a slight tremor through the stone. ‘It doesn’t look too good!’ you shout across to Samu. He ties his end of the Rope around his waist and, gingerly, begins his crossing. He has reached the middle of the bridge when it starts to crumble. Large slabs of stone fall away and Samu is forced to run. But he is too late—the bridge collapses at the centre and Samu disappears. Although Hugi and Urik have a tight hold of the Rope, Samu’s great bulk, plus the downward pull of his fall, snatches it from their hands. You are dragged forward: the Rope is still tied around your waist!</p>
