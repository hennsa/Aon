<h3>186</h3>

<p>Hugi examines the bridge closely. After a short spell of deliberation, he turns and says, ‘It will bear our weight, but it would be best if we cross one at a time. Who wants to go first?’ He steps away, indicating that he has no intention of crossing first.</p>
<p>Urik gives him a disapproving look and steps forward. ‘I am Kundi, an old man, but do not fear to cross.’ After scowling at Hugi, he runs across the bridge as fast as his old bones will allow. A cloud of dust falls from the bridge and a couple of loose stones tumble and fall into the black water below.</p>
<p>‘Me next,’ says Hugi, running across the bridge with nimble feet before anyone can try to take his place. His light passage makes no impression on the bridge and he calls across to you and Samu. ‘It’s perfectly safe,’ he says, unhelpfully.</p>
<p>Samu turns to you: ‘I am the heaviest. You should go next.’</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not have a Rope, <a href="sect294.htm">turn to 294</a>.</p>
