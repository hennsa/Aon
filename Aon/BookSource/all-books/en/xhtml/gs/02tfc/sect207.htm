<h3>207</h3>

<p>Sado prepares his men to charge. A familiar yellow light attracts your attention, shining from the highest turret of the fortress. It can only be the light of the Kazim Stone, a powerful instrument of pain in the hands of a Shadakine Wytch.</p>
<p>The yellow glow expands and then envelopes the flagging soldiers who stand before the fortress. You see their resolve tighten as the Kazim Stone robs them of their fear. ‘Sorcery!’ breathes Sado in a desperate voice. You feel the gaze of Sado and his men burning into you like an accusation. Slowly, the Shadakine advance, tightening the ragged line of their defence in preparation for a counterattack; they move like automatons as the Kazim Stone burns into their minds.<sup><a href="#sect207-1-foot" name="sect207-1">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Sorcery and wish to use it against the Kazim Stone, <a href="sect6.htm">turn to 6</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Enchantment and wish to use it against the Shadakine, <a href="sect146.htm">turn to 146</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to challenge the power of the Kazim Stone with your Staff, <a href="sect234.htm">turn to 234</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect207-1-foot" href="#sect207-1">16</a>] You are forced to choose to use a Magical Power, even though all the Powers that are available to you may require you to use more <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points than you currently possess. If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose to simply subtract the number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points required to use the Power you select. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative. Alternatively, you may choose the method used in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/sect175.htm">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a> for resolving this problem: For the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you lack, you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point).</p></div>
