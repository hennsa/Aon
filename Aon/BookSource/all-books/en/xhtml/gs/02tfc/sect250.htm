<h3>250</h3>

<p>A patch of brush and foliage is pulled aside to reveal a concealed entrance. Following Sado, you enter a wide tunnel lit with torches. ‘This tunnel leads all the way to our secret headquarters beneath the city of Karnali,’ he says.</p>
<p>The tunnel twists and turns for many miles before opening into a large cavern. You and Urik are given food and wine, and while you eat, he tells you of his army—the Freedom Guild, a rebel band resisting the rule of the Shadakine Empire.</p>
<p>‘Karnali was the last city to fall to Shasarak,’ Sado explains. ‘The spirit of unrest was never truly crushed, and so we fight on in our small way, striking blows against the Wytch-king whenever we may. Our attacks are based in the marshes, for we hope to avoid the retribution of the Warward, Kiro, against our people by making him believe that we come from outside the city. The Shadakine waste much effort patrolling the marsh, seeking to flush us out, and attention is drawn away from the city. Only our fear that the citizens of Karnali would be punished for our actions prevents us from rising up within the city walls. And,’ he shrugs, ‘our numbers are small while the Shadakine maintain a heavy garrison. But what of you?’</p>
<p>A thin man comes and begins to clear away your plates and empty wine goblets. He brushes past you and, to your amazement, attempts to pick your pocket. ‘You, man!’ shouts Sado, ‘What do you think you’re doing? Guards, arrest this man.’</p>
<p>He turns and apologizes to you, explaining that the bulk of his army is recruited from the criminal ranks of the city. You explain your quest and the land that you seek. Sado’s eyes widen with astonishment. ‘Then the legends are true?’ he gapes. ‘The Shianti still exist!’</p>
<p>You nod. ‘If my quest should finally succeed and I retrieve the Moonstone, the full might of their wisdom and magic will be turned against Shasarak,’ you tell him.</p>
<p>‘How the people would rejoice to know that a Shianti walked among us once more,’ says Sado, ‘though I understand the need for secrecy. Nevertheless,’ he continues, his eyes lighting up, ‘I would ask a boon of you. Tonight, we attempt our most daring stratagem against the corrupt rule of the Shadakine. Stand with us in battle tonight; aid us if you will. With the might of a Shianti Wizard in our ranks, who knows what we could achieve! Help the Freedom Guild, Grey Star, in our struggle to free the people of Karnali.’</p>
<p>He looks, a searching gaze on his face, with an intensity that almost crackles with energy.</p>
