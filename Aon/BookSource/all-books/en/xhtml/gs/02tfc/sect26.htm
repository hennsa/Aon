<h3>26</h3>

<p>Samu throws the door shut and Hugi, with his vast knowledge of locks, triggers the door lock with one of the many strange tools he carries for that purpose. The passage winds on for many miles and soon you have lost all sense of direction, and can no longer tell whether you are travelling towards the Mountains of Morn or away from them. Finally, the passage ends and a secret hatch opens on to the balcony of an ornate building. The balcony overlooks a vast hall where you witness a strange sight.</p>
<p>An old man in tattered ermine robes sits upon a broken throne, surrounded by a bizarre gathering of people. Two guards in rusty armour stand either side of him as the ragged assembly of mad courtiers dances a stately pavane without music. Two stairways lead from either side of the balcony into the hall and these are the only exits; it is impossible to walk down these stairs without being seen.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to walk down the stairs, <a href="sect284.htm">turn to 284</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to charge through the strange court and try to fight your way out, <a href="sect87.htm">turn to 87</a>.</p>
