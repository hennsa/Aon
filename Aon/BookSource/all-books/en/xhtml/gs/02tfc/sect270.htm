<h3>270</h3>

<p>He throws open the door and you slip inside. Panting, Urik slams the door shut behind him. Within moments it seems that the whole of the mad court of the king is hammering on the door. You survey the interior of the room with dismay for there is no other exit. Samu is trying to keep the baying crowd from forcing the door but even his great strength cannot hold it shut for long.</p>
<p>‘There must be another way out,’ says Hugi, calmly, as if he has all the time in the world. He begins to run his hands along the walls of the small room, knocking with his knuckle against the smooth stone. Then he hears a hollow tone. ‘Here!’ he exclaims.</p>
<p>A wooden panel falls away in Hugi’s hand to reveal the latch of a hidden door. It is locked but Hugi produces a wallet full of small knives and pieces of wire and selects a length of fine copper with which to pick the lock. ‘Hurry!’ says Samu. ‘This door will not hold.’</p>
<p>Skilfully, Hugi opens the door to reveal a passage leading downwards. You run down into its darkness, little knowing what lies ahead.</p>
