<h3>287</h3>

<p>‘Sado, I am sorry but I must refuse. My quest demands it.’</p>
<p>A look of fury passes momentarily over Sado’s face. ‘Very well,’ he answers sadly. ‘Then I will ensure your safe conduct from the city to aid you on your quest.’</p>
<p>A small escort of soldiers in disguise leads you and Urik through the city streets. Suddenly, you notice that you are passing the stone fortress of the Shadakine—you have been duped by Sado; he has gone ahead with his plan. A huge mob of Karnalese civilians armed with sticks and stones charges towards the fortress, and you are trapped between the enraged mob and the Shadakine who are leaving the fortress to counterattack. Urik curses as you turn to face the Shadakine.<sup><a href="#sect287-1-foot" name="sect287-1">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Chaksu Pipes and wish to use them, <a href="sect3.htm">turn to 3</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Power of Enchantment and wish to conceal your appearance, <a href="sect203.htm">turn to 203</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Elementalism and wish to use it, <a href="sect21.htm">turn to 21</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to release a long-range attack at the advancing Shadakine, <a href="sect303.htm">turn to 303</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect287-1-foot" href="#sect287-1">18</a>] You may be forced to choose to use a Magical Power, even though all the Powers that are available to you may require you to use more <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points than you currently possess. If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose to simply subtract the number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points required to use the Power you select. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative. Alternatively, you may choose the method used in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/sect175.htm">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a> for resolving this problem: For the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you lack, you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point).</p></div>
