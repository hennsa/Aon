<h3>298</h3>

<p>It is a sleep that gives you no rest. Through a dark haze, the ghastly figure of Shasarak appears. ‘And still you persist—fool!’ he spits. ‘I see that my friends were unable to make you see the error of your ways,’ he says, scornfully. ‘Perhaps this will better persuade you.’</p>

<p>With a gesture of his ruined hand, he shows you the vision of a young girl, sobbing, surrounded by a pool of darkness. With a dull ache in your heart you recognize the girl. It is Tanith, the Wytch girl who helped you escape from a Shadakine prison in the Port of Suhn and finally leapt to her death to save you. Now, trapped upon another plane, she weeps alone, her eyes wild with fear. ‘Tanith!’ you call into the void of your dream.</p>
<p>Shasarak laughs, savagely. ‘She cannot hear you, Wizard. No one can hear her now. She is mine to torment as and when I wish. And my imagination knows no limit in the matter of torment—in that field I rule supreme.’ The Wytch-king begins to laugh with malicious glee, relishing Tanith’s plight and your misery at witnessing it. ‘Turn aside, Grey Star, or she is lost.’ With the howl of Shasarak’s mocking laughter ringing in your ears, you wake with a start. You have lost 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point and 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point during the night.</p>
<p>In the grey light of dawn you trudge towards the Forbidden City, your companions walking silently by your side. Soon, you are able to see the outline of the city in the distance. A few more hours and you will be standing before its gates. There is only one solution to the sinking of your heart and the mounting ache that racks your mind: you must complete your quest.</p>
