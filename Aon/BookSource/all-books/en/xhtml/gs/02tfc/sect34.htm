<h3>34</h3>

<p>Within the vision in your mind, you point towards the Element of Fire and, crackling with energy, it moves forwards. The use of this Magical Power has cost you 3 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points.</p>
<p>You open your eyes to see the Shadakine moving into position at the edge of the lake. The Shadakine who leads them is shouting instructions as they load their crossbows and prepare to attack. Unsuspecting, they take aim, failing to notice the smoke that is rising behind them.</p>
<p>Then before a single bolt has been released, a startled Shadakine breaks cover, leaping to his feet and slapping maniacally at his clothes. Within seconds he is wreathed in flames and the uniforms of his comrades have begun to smoulder. Desperately, one of the Shadakine hurls himself into the lake, and immediately the Eijalfish speeds towards him. Urik does not wait to see the outcome of this encounter and dives into the waters of the lake, splashing out towards the farther shore. Without hesitation you follow his example, the sound of the screaming Shadakine ringing in your ears.</p>
<p>You reach dry land and scramble out of the water. A fearful howl crosses the lake and your blood runs cold. Urik cocks his head to one side. ‘They have fierce Magdi hounds, their hunting dogs,’ he says. He points to a shallow waterway that winds its way through the tall grass. ‘We move now. Keep to water. Hide scent. Come!’ You both move off, stepping cautiously along the channel.</p>
