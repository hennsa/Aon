<h3>115</h3>

<p><i>This was once the realm of the Demon, Steth-Amon, a master of sound,</i> the Guardian recounts. <i>We, the Elessin, were created his slave singers, a choir of the damned. His was the music of dissonance; it could drive men insane or lure them and possess their minds. Long we laboured in his service. However, we sought the beauty of harmonious music, the melody of accord and we conceived of a plan to overthrow our lord. We created the Threnogem, a tool of silence, for without silence music has no meaning. Then, while he slumbered, we dropped the Threnogem into his open mouth and silenced him, robbing him of his power over us. He froze in the position you see him now, for the statue is Steth-Amon, mastered by the silence of the Threnogem. That you seek to take the statue from our realm is pleasing to us, for all our power has been devoted to giving life to the Threnogem and keeping Steth-Amon silent. If the Threnogem is removed from his mouth the demon will be released. All we ask is that you do not remove the Threnogem while you are in our domain. If you wish, we will help you carry the statue to your flying machine.</i></p>
<p>You agree to the Guardian’s offer.</p>
