<h3>19</h3>

<p>Pulling back the steering lever, you draw more power and coax the flying machine to climb. Soon, the Crystal Tower is nothing but a speck on a barren grey landscape. Taking out the Gyronome, you discover that you are travelling in the right direction. Presumably, there is more than one route that leads from the Neverness. The sound of the Gyronome grows louder as you climb higher into the featureless sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the craft lurches forwards and you are pitched to the floor. You feel a tingling sensation throughout your body and, as you stagger to your feet, you gaze upon a wondrous sight. You are flying through a clear, sunlit sky. The wind is rushing past your face and, below, the land is fresh and green.</p>
<p>You have passed through an invisible barrier or Gate that connects the Neverness with this realm. In the distance you can see a city, gleaming brightly beneath the sun: it is the Singing City of the Elessin.</p>
<p>You sway as the wind buffets the ship. You struggle to regain control as the Ethetron violently bucks and reels. You are disoriented by the sudden change and, clumsily, you try to make a landing.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess the Talisman of the Shianti, add 2 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0–3, <a href="sect13.htm">turn to 13</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 4–11, <a href="sect77.htm">turn to 77</a>.</p>
