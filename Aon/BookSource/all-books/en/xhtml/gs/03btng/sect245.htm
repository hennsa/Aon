<h3>245</h3>

<p><i>This was once the realm of the Demon, Steth-Amon, Master of Sound. We, the Elessin, were created his slave singers, a choir of the damned, and long did we labour in his service. His was the music of dissonance, designed to drive his victims insane or to lure them with its enticements. Steth-Amon would sow seeds of discord and clamour in the realms of mortals so that they would join him and then be doomed to lives of misery under his dominion. But we, the Elessin, conceived of a plan to overthrow him, for we desire the beauty of music: harmony and the melody of accord. We created the Threnogem, a tool of silence, for without silence there can be no true music. While he slumbered we dropped the Threnogem into his open mouth and silenced him. Robbed of his power, the power of his mighty voice, he froze as you see him now.</i></p>
<p>He gestures towards the statue beneath the swirling pillar of light. <i>We built this place to contain him and called it the Palace of the Screaming God. Each day we sing our song, giving force to the Threnogem so that the Screaming God should remain forever silent. All our power is dedicated to this single act, for his was a great evil. If the Threnogem is removed, the Screaming God will be released. Those who have sent you upon this quest know not of this, or else they do not care. Perhaps they desire to free the Screaming God, or wish your death. However, there is a way for you to fulfil your bargain and do us a great service, too.</i></p>
<p>Yet another bargain! ‘What is it you wish me to do?’ you ask.</p>
<p><i>Take the statue with you,</i> the Guardian replies. <i>Take it in your flying machine and remove it from this realm. Give the statue, with the Threnogem inside it, to the Academicians. Let them guard it as we have done. It would be just.</i></p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to agree to the Guardian’s request, <a href="sect182.htm">turn to 182</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not trust the Guardian and wish to try to overpower him and steal the Threnogem, <a href="sect322.htm">turn to 322</a>.</p>
