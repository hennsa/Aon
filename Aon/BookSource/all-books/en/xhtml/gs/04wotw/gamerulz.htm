<h2>The Game Rules</h2>

<p>To keep a record of your adventure, use the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Before you set off on your adventure, you must discover how well your Shianti masters have prepared you for your quest by determining your fighting prowess—<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>—your state of mind—<span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>—and your physical stamina—<span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. To do this take a pencil and, with eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of 14). When you fight, your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The second number that you need is one to represent your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>. Do not use the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. You begin this adventure with a <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> total of 50, as your first touch of the Moonstone of the Shianti regenerates your Magical Powers immediately. If you possess unused <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points from earlier <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures, add them to the 50 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points which possession of the Moonstone grants you.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> Write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. If you decide to use a spell or the power of your Wizard’s Staff, then you will lose <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero, or below, you may not use any spells<sup><a href="#gamerulz-5-foot" name="gamerulz-5">3</a></sup> or any additional <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points in combat to increase the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> loss of an opponent.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-3-foot" name="gamerulz-3">4</a></sup> Lost <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure and it is possible for your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p>The third attribute is your power of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. You start with a total of 30 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points when your first touch of the Moonstone fills your body with energy and power. Add any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points gained from playing previous <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures to your initial score of 30 and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-4-foot" name="gamerulz-4">5</a></sup> If you are wounded in combat, you will lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure but can never rise above the number with which you began the adventure.</p>

<div id="footnotes">
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-1-foot" href="#gamerulz-1">1</a>] It is implied that you must pick a new <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> even if have already completed previous one or more <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures. This conflicts with the rules for the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books where you carry over your score from a previous successfully completed adventure. For the sake of consistency, players may wish to carry over their existing score from the last <cite>Grey Star</cite> book they completed.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-2-foot" href="#gamerulz-2">2</a>] The original intent of the author was most likely that the player should add 50 to their final <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score from the end of their last successfully completed <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-5-foot" href="#gamerulz-5">3</a>] There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="sect175.htm">Section 175</a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, then you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point you lack (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point). If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score.</p>
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-3-foot" href="#gamerulz-3">4</a>] It is possible for your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-4-foot" href="#gamerulz-4">5</a>] The original intent of the author was most likely that the player should add 30 to their final <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score from the end of their last successfully completed <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure. In the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, it is standard practice to restore one’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to their original total when carrying them over from one adventure to the next, but the power of the Moonstone seems to change those rules in this case.</p></div>
