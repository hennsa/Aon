<h3>1</h3>

<p>At last you hold the fabled Moonstone in your hand. It pulses and glows with a strange milky light. Tanith’s eyes shine wildly, and your heart pounds with excitement. The Moonstone; ancient vessel of all Shianti wisdom. What secrets, what powers, does this magical artefact hold in its glowing heart? The stone exudes a comforting warmth as it nestles in the palm of your hand and you feel a presence in your mind. You hear a familiar voice and your heart lifts to ever greater heights, for it is Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, speaking to you.</p>

<p>‘Hail Wizard, son of man. You have succeeded. We, the Shianti, rejoice and praise you. That which you hold in your hand contains the power that will enable you to defeat the evil Wytch-king, Shasarak.’</p>
<p>A crowd of excited voices fills your mind as each of the Shianti sends words of congratulations and admiration. The last of these voices is Maiteya, your old friend, the Shianti master who taught you all you know. ‘And so, “little one”,’ he says, affectionately ‘now you possess the Moonstone, Shasarak’s bane. While you hold it, we, the Shianti, are able to speak with you but this communication cannot be maintained much longer. Because you have the Moonstone, we have sufficient power to return you to the world, but there is much you should know before we do so. Listen well, Grey Star, for I know not when we will speak again.</p>
<p>‘Though it seems to you but a short time since you arrived at the Daziarn, seven years have passed here in the material world. During your search for the Shadow Gate, you visited the city of Karnali. Your arrival there inspired a revolution, led by Sado of the Long Knife and his Army of the Freedom Guild. After your departure, the Freedom Guild withstood a great siege by Shadakine warriors, who eventually withdrew defeated, much to Shasarak’s displeasure. Word spread of this victory and the strength of the Army of the Freedom Guild grew. Strategically, Karnali was too isolated to make a great impact against the Shadakine Empire, but, due to the surrounding Gurlu Marshes, it remained self sufficient. Soon, many were travelling to Karnali to escape the tyranny of Shasarak’s rule. Pockets of resistance broke out in the townships of Wenat, Zhanis, Sena, and the city of Forlu, and the Freedom Guild soon dominated the hills and the plains of the south. They raided Shadakine supply trains and succeeded in depriving the empire of much of its wealth, cutting off all land routes to the Port of Suhn, the wealthiest and most important trade centre of the empire. An army is now formed in Karnali and, in three days, it will march against the Shadakine Empire, hoping to take Port Suhn in the first of many conquests. But, unknown to Sado and the Army of the Freedom Guild, a vast Shadakine force has been mustered in the Sadi desert. Soon, it will march against them. The Army of the Freedom Guild number ten thousand to the Shadakine’s thirty thousand. The Freedom Guild cannot hope to succeed against such overwhelming odds. You must save them. Take them to the Forest of Fernmost. It is most important that you go there. There is little time and much to do Grey Star … ’</p>
<p>The voice grows faint and you realize that the Shianti will be unable to maintain contact for much longer. ‘And now, Grey Star, the contact breaks and we must return you to the world to begin the last of your great labours. Are there any last words of advice we can offer you?’</p>
<p>Your mind races as you think of all that you might need to know.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to know where the Shianti intend sending you and where in the Shadakine Empire your quest will begin, <a href="sect348.htm">turn to 348</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to hear the Shianti’s own advice, <a href="sect6.htm">turn to 6</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to see Shasarak himself and perhaps discover something of his plans, <a href="sect340.htm">turn to 340</a>.</p>
