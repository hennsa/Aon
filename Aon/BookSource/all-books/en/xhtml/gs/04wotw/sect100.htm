<h3>100</h3>

<p>Like his comrades, the Masbaté warrior stands well over seven feet tall. Clad in a corselet of worn, padded leather, his body ripples with taut muscle beneath skin as black as ebony. His hair is long and his eyes still burn with the raging fire of battle. He stares at you curiously. ‘Who are you?’ he asks.</p>
<p>‘Greetings men of the Masbaté,’ you reply. ‘I am Grey Star, Wizard of the Shianti, bound upon a quest in their service, and sworn to the destruction of the Wytch-king, Shasarak.’</p>
<p>‘Can this be?’ the warrior gasps, shaking his head in amazement. ‘We will talk of this later in a safer place. My name is Dioka, chief of this warrior band. Come with us to the mountain lair of the Masbaté in the Kashima Mountains. The demons may return in greater numbers. The King must hear of your return.’</p>
<p>You agree to his request and soon you are struggling to keep pace with the rapid march of the Masbaté warrior as he heads towards the mountains and the secret lair of the last of a proud and mighty race.</p>
