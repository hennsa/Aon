<h3>104</h3>

<p>You are surrounded by hundreds of creatures. They close in with evil expressions on their ruined faces and a giant, wingless bat slashes out at you with its claws. However, you are able to hold your ground unflinchingly, for you feel nothing. Soon a great crowd of demons is slashing and gouging at you but still you remain unharmed and slowly you beat a path toward the portal. As you progress, the light of invulnerability that once enfolded you begins to fade and you begin to feel some pain at fresh blows. You field a brilliant defence, however, taking full advantage of being mounted. More and more demons back away in fear of this indestructible warrior who wields a Staff of burning death.</p>
<p>You use 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points<sup><a href="#sect104-1-foot" name="sect104-1">14</a></sup> and lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point in your fight to reach the portal. Now, at last, it is at hand. There is a lull in the fighting. The demon pack forms a large circle around you and they stand contemplating another charge. You pray that they do not, for your magical invulnerability has faded. You must act swiftly. You draw out the Moonstone and focus your energy upon it. The demon horde wavers.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect104-1-foot" href="#sect104-1">14</a>] If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative. Alternatively, you may choose the method used in <a href="sect175.htm">Section 175</a> for resolving this problem: For the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you lack, you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point).</p></div>
