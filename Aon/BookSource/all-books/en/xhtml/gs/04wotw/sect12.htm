<h3>12</h3>

<p>You smash the fabric that binds the skeleton’s body but you are fighting the creature with magic. Your fellow soldiers do not have the same advantage and the air is filled with their terrified cries. Many are being slain and, as they die, Shasarak’s spell takes them, and they rise to fight once more as soldiers of the undead. Those that survive find themselves fighting their friends and comrades. The powers you possess protect only you from attack. You can save the Freedom Guild only by destroying Shasarak. The time has come: you must go to him.</p>
<p class="choice">If you are versed in the Higher Magick of Thaumaturgy, you may deduct 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points from your total to cast a teleportation spell and <a href="sect39.htm">turn to 39</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a Temeris Potion, you may use it to teleport without using any <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points; <a href="sect39.htm">turn to 39</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you are using the power of the Dimension Door locked in the Moonstone, you may deduct 4 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points from your total to teleport and <a href="sect39.htm">turn to 39</a>.</p>
<p class="deadend">If you are unable to teleport by any of these means, you have failed in your quest and your adventure is over.</p>
