<h3>213</h3>

<p>You continue on your easterly course, constantly on the lookout for danger. More than an hour of tense silence passes as you and Tanith hurry along. The tension is broken by Tanith’s sudden cry. ‘Look!’ she says, pointing. ‘There’s a river up ahead.’</p>
<p>Less than a mile away, a river gleams and sparkles. You and Tanith break into a trot. When you reach the river bank you both drop to your knees, bending to scoop up great handfuls of cool water. You drink long and deeply before your raging thirst is quenched.</p>
<p>You have reached the banks of the Dolani River. It leads south and fills Lake Dolani, which lies at least thirty miles away, according to Tanith. To the northeast lie the Kashima Mountains, where the river begins; the mountains look to be at least fifty miles away. The river is too wide and too deep to cross at this point; you will have to travel further upstream where it is likely to be narrower and shallower.</p>
<p>You are just bending to take another drink of the refreshing water when Tanith touches you lightly on the shoulder. ‘Grey Star,’ she murmurs. ‘Ready yourself. We are about to be attacked.’</p>
