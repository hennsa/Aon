<h3>23</h3>

<p>Bathed in the radiant aura of the Moonstone’s protection, you continue the journey east. You top a rise and look down its gentle slope. Ahead, you can see a sparkling river. With a cry of joy, you and Tanith run towards it. At the water’s edge you both drop to your knees to drink. Scooping up great mouthfuls of the cool water, you quench your raging thirst. You are on the banks of the Dolani River. Tanith tells you that its source is to the northeast, in the Kashima Mountains. Its southerly course leads to Lake Dolani, which she guesses to be at least thirty miles away. The river is too wide and deep to be crossed here, although it is likely to be narrower and shallower further upstream. At this point the light of the Moonstone, which you laid on the ground beside you before beginning to drink, starts to flicker as the power of your incantation fades. Suddenly Tanith cries out.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star!’ she screams. ‘We are attacked!’</p>

<p>You snatch up the Moonstone and spin round. Four fearsome creatures have mounted the rise behind you. As you watch, they rush towards you, coming to a cowering halt within twenty paces of you both. Afraid of the fading aura of the Moonstone as the light decreases, each takes another shambling step towards you. They are ghastly, malformed creatures, each with a different misshapen form. These are demons summoned long ago by the Wytch-king Shasarak to conquer the people who once inhabited the Lissan Plain. Having fulfilled their purpose, they were left to roam the plain by Shasarak. The leading demon—the largest—takes another step forward, its glistening green skin and toad-like features reflected in the dull light of the setting sun.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue the necromantic incantation of protection that has almost faded from the Moonstone, <a href="sect35.htm">turn to 35</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you prefer to launch a long-range attack at the leading demon with your Wizard’s Staff, <a href="sect65.htm">turn to 65</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to wait to see what the demons will do, <a href="sect93.htm">turn to 93</a>.</p>
