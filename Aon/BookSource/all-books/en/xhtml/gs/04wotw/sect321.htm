<h3>321</h3>

<p>The night passes without incident and the following morning you and the Masbaté break camp and continue south. You cross a flat land of farms and small villages, the inhabitants of which come out of their homes and look upon you with wonder.</p>
<p>You warn the people of the vast Shadakine Army that follows and that may have already crossed the River Dosar. Though you are glad to see that your presence has heartened so many, you realize with regret that word of your passing is sure to reach the city of Andui to the northeast, where there is sure to be a Shadakine garrison. Perhaps it will be sent against you, ahead of the large army trapped north of the River Dosar or perhaps the Shadakine Wytch of that city, Mother Chowloon, sister of Mother Magri of Suhn, will come against you.</p>
<p>Thoughts of Shadakine Wytches remind you of Tanith’s plight. You wonder how she fares and whether Mother Magri has successfully drawn Tanith back to the Port of Suhn in the east.</p>
<p class="choice">If you are versed in the Higher Magick of a Visionary and wish to exert 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points to discover how Tanith is, <a href="sect305.htm">turn to 305</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If not, <a href="sect282.htm">turn to 282</a>.</p>
