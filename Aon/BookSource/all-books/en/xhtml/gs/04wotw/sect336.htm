<h3>336</h3>

<p>Your Alchemist’s eye tells you that many unusual plants grow in the forest, some of which are of great use. You borrow some empty vials from a healer in the army’s employ. While Sado and his men watch for the approach of the Shadakine Army, you pass the day searching for various herbs and plants and preparing potions. It is evening by the time you have finished. You have the choice of making and keeping any of the following items for future use. Remember that your Herb Pouch can hold up to eight items, and any other potions may be stored in your Backpack.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Potions of Laumspur (Each Potion restores up to 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points when swallowed before or after combat. One potion equals one dose.)</li>
<li>1 Potion of Alether (Increases <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 2 points when swallowed before an attack.)</li>
<li>2 Tarama Seeds (Swallowing one seed enables a wizard to use his Wizard’s Staff or Magical Power without losing any <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. They take up no room in your Herb Pouch or Backpack.)<sup><a href="#sect336-1-foot" name="sect336-1">21</a></sup></li>
<li>1 Calacena Potion (A useful aid to the casting of spells of Enchantment.)</li>
<li>1 Potion of Mustow (Creates a foul, choking gas.)</li>
<li>1 Potion of Ezeran Acid (A metal-eating acid.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="choice">If you have some Phinomel Pods, <a href="sect355.htm">turn to 355</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If not, <a href="sect359.htm">turn to 359</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect336-1-foot" href="#sect336-1">21</a>] Tarama Seeds may be recorded as Special Items since they don’t take up space in your Herb Pouch or Backpack. Each Tarama Seed can be used to cast exactly one spell or to use your Wizard’s Staff outside of close combat (e.g. to fire a bolt of energy at a distant enemy) without using the normally required <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. Tarama Seeds cannot be used to maintain the effect of a spell or in place of other drains on your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, like mental attacks. It also seems inappropriate to use a Tarama Seed in close combat where you could then decide to expend an infinite amount of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> to automatically win a fight.</p></div>
