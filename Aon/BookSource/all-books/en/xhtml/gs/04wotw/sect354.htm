<h3>354</h3>

<p>Dawn is breaking when the alarm is raised and you are alerted to an attack on the camp. Swiftly you rise, taking up your Staff and rushing outside. There is great clamour everywhere. Men are rushing in all directions, still donning their armour. You rush towards Sado’s tent. He is not there but an attendant tells you that a group of Shadakine has attempted an attack. Sado is already at the scene of the battle with a unit of soldiers, hand picked to fight a rearguard action, while the remainder of the army retreats to the Forest of Fernmost. This unit was chosen by Sado himself last night in readiness for just such an eventuality. You are sure that the Shadakine attack cannot be from the large army you trapped on the other side of the River Dosar; it can only be the garrison from Andui.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go to the scene of the battle, where Sado fights a rearguard action, <a href="sect337.htm">turn to 337</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to lead the bulk of the army into the Forest of Fernmost, <a href="sect343.htm">turn to 343</a>.</p>
