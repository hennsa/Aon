<h3>6</h3>

<p>‘We will advise you as best we can,’ he replies. ‘Although it is your own wisdom that has brought you, this far, you should not be afraid to trust your own judgement. In the matter of the inevitable challenge of Shasarak, we advise you not to stand against him immediately. He embarks now on a war that will be costly to his strength and demanding of his powers. Wait for him to weaken himself with some great deed of sorcery before journeying into his dark halls for the final duel. First ensure the safety of the Army of the Freedom Guild. Without your help, they will perish. Be on the constant lookout for allies, for the Wytch-king has many enemies, and look to the Forest of Fernmost—a mighty power dwells there and it will do well in your service.’</p>
<p>His voice grows faint.</p>
