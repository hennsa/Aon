<h3>91</h3>

<p>The power of invulnerability is an immense feat, requiring great effort. You concentrate your will upon strengthening the fabric of your body, immersing it in waves of Sorcery. Your body begins to glow with an eerie blue light. You stand back and look with disdain on the first of the demons, the toad beast, as it hurls itself at you. Its initial blow has no effect on you. Instead the creature howls in pain and clutches at its clawed hand, hurt from the impact of your iron flesh. The remaining demons make similar attempts to harm you, all with the same result. When all their efforts have proved futile they begin to back away, cowering with fear beneath the intensity of your unflinching gaze. Impressive as this power is, it has cost you 4 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. You raise your Staff, ready to strike at the nearest of the demons, a vile, hunched figure with snapping, crab-like pincers and a shiny, purple body like a huge beetle. However before you can strike, all four vanish. They do not return.</p>
