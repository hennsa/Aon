<h2>Errata</h2>


<h3><a name="errintro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>We have taken our unique opportunity to correct errors and to enforce a standard of English usage. We list our changes here. If you see anything that needs correction, please <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Contact">contact</a> the Project Aon Staff.</p>
<h3><a name="errerr">Errata List</a></h3>

<p>(<a href="title.htm">Blurb</a>) Replaced ‘<cite>FLIGHT FROM THE DARK</cite>’ with ‘<strong><cite>Flight from the Dark</cite></strong>,’.</p>
<p><a href="tssf.htm">The Story so Far</a>) Replaced ‘Darklord armies’ with ‘Darkland armies’. Replaced ‘in the poor light are’ with ‘in the poor light is’.</p>

Replaced ‘points.)’ with ‘points).’.</p>
<p>(<a href="discplnz.htm">Kai Disciplines</a>) Replaced ‘Kai Discipline section’ with ‘Kai Disciplines section’. Removed ‘ on the last page of the book’. Capitalized all occurrences of ‘discipline’. Replaced ‘fully in <a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment section</a>’ with ‘fully in the <a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment section</a>’. Replaced ‘Lone Wolf’ with ‘<cite>Lone Wolf</cite>’ when referring to the series. Replaced ‘Kai monastery’ with ‘Kai Monastery’. Replaced ‘will be of use’ with ‘may be of use’. Replaced ‘Explained fully’ with ‘This will be explained fully’.</p>
<p>(<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) Added periods to the sentences describing the Helmet and Chainmail Waistcoat.</p>
<p>(<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment: How to use your equipment</a>) Added a period to the second from last sentence in the Weapons subsection. Replaced ‘food or’ with ‘food, or’. Replaced ‘two weapons’ with ‘two Weapons’. Added ‘You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.’ in harmony with the Collector’s Edition. Added ‘It cannot be used to increase <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points immediately prior to a combat.’ in harmony with the Collector’s Edition.</p>
<p>(<a href="cmbtrulz.htm">Rules for Combat</a>) Removed a superfluous period in the second paragraph of the first example. Removed ‘ on the inside back cover of the book’.

<p>(<a href="levels.htm">Levels of Kai Training</a>) The Levels of Kai Training section did not originally appear in this book, but has been added for the reader’s information.</p>
<p>(<a href="kaiwisdm.htm">Kai Wisdom</a>) Removed ‘on the back cover of the book ’. Replaced ‘Lone Wolf’ with ‘<cite>Lone Wolf</cite>’ when referring to the series.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect1.htm">1</a>) Replaced ‘Sommerlund’ with ‘Sommlending’. Made the last choice (about using Sixth Sense) the first.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect4.htm">4</a>) Moved the last choice (about the Tracking Discipline) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect7.htm">7</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption. Replaced ‘skipped and’ with ‘skipped, and’. Replaced ‘If the number if’ with ‘If the number is’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect17.htm">17</a>) Changed the last choice that led to <a href="sect331.htm">Section 331</a> to lead to <a href="sect316.htm">Section 316</a> instead in order to parallel <a href="sect89.htm">Section 89</a>. It doesn’t make sense to skip the section describing the tumble downhill.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect18.htm">18</a>) Moved the choice about the Camouflage Discipline into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect19.htm">19</a>) Moved the choice about the Tracking Discipline into the first position. Replaced ‘Gallowbrush’ with ‘gallowbrush’: you can’t pick it up.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect20.htm">20</a>) Replaced ‘Jala’ with ‘jala’. Replaced ‘dagger’ with ‘Dagger’. The original versions of this book had this section lead to <a href="sect272.htm">Section 272</a>, which is incorrect. We are using the correct section, <a href="sect273.htm">273</a>, as used in more recent editions.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect21.htm">21</a>) The text is unchanged but we have concatenated some of the paragraphs for the dice rolls for clarification. Replaced ‘on to’ with ‘onto’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect22.htm">22</a>) Added a comma after ‘0–4’ in the first choice. Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect23.htm">23</a>) Reordered the choices. The choice that was originally first (about removing the pin) is now last. The choice about the Golden Key was originally last and is now first. Also added ‘and wish to use it’ after ‘Golden Key’. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect32.htm">32</a>) Replaced ‘unmistakeable’ with ‘unmistakable’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect33.htm">33</a>) Replaced ‘fur and’ with ‘fur, and’.</p>

<p>(<a href="sect36.htm">36</a>) Added a comma after ‘4 or lower’ in the first choice.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect37.htm">37</a>) Added a blank line before the decisions and reversed their order.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect38.htm">38</a>) Replaced both occurrences of ‘woodsmoke’ with ‘wood smoke’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect41.htm">41</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect46.htm">46</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect51.htm">51</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect54.htm">54</a>) Replaced ‘the last thing you remember are’ with ‘the last thing you remember is’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect57.htm">57</a>) Replaced ‘liquids and’ with ‘liquids, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect58.htm">58</a>) Made the choice that led to <a href="sect286.htm">Section 286</a> to lead to <a href="sect251.htm">Section 251</a> instead. Many readers have realized that there was an error here but assumed that the original numbers for the choices should simply be reversed, giving Lone Wolf a chance at survival for hiding and certain death for riding on. Actually, there is no certain death possibility here. Hiding is supposed to grant you certain survival. The proof of this correction is that there is no other path to <a href="sect251.htm">Section 251</a>, and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect61.htm">61</a>) Replaced ‘blood-smeared and’ with ‘blood-smeared, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect62.htm">62</a>) Replaced ‘crossbow had’ with ‘crossbow has’. Replaced ‘west and’ with ‘west, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect63.htm">63</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect67.htm">67</a>) Made the choice that led to <a href="sect140.htm">Section 140</a> to lead to <a href="sect252.htm">Section 252</a> instead. If you read <a href="sect222.htm">Section 222</a>, you’ll notice that the choice leading to <a href="sect252.htm">Section 252</a> is the east track. Indeed, only <a href="sect140.htm">Section 140</a> may lead you to the bear of which Tracking is supposed to warn you in this section.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect69.htm">69</a>) Replaced ‘Gallowbrush’ with ‘gallowbrush’: you can’t pick it up.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect70.htm">70</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect71.htm">71</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect73.htm">73</a>) Replaced ‘the Darklords cruellest troops’ with ‘the Darklords’ cruellest troops’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect75.htm">75</a>) Replaced ‘border rangers’ with ‘Border Rangers’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect76.htm">76</a>) Replaced ‘slip it into the pocket of your jacket’ with ‘slip this Vordak Gem into your Backpack’. Replaced ‘horse and’ with ‘horse, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect82.htm">82</a>) Replaced ‘steed and’ with ‘steed, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect83.htm">83</a>) Added another ‘s’ after ‘posses’ in the last choice and moved that choice into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect87.htm">87</a>) Replaced ‘Graveweed’ with ‘graveweed’. Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect88.htm">88</a>) Replaced ‘or do’ with ‘or if you do’. Replaced ‘my Lord’ with ‘my lord’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect91.htm">91</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect97.htm">97</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect105.htm">105</a>) Replaced ‘jet black’ with ‘jet-black’. Replaced ‘skill,’ with ‘skill, or if you do not wish to use it,’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect112.htm">112</a>) Replaced ‘cavemouth’ with ‘cave mouth’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect119.htm">119</a>) Replaced ‘Gallowbrush’ with ‘gallowbrush’: you can’t pick it up.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect120.htm">120</a>) Replaced ‘strike, then’ with ‘strike and then’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect121.htm">121</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect122.htm">122</a>) Split the first sentence which was actually two independent clauses into two sentences to fix it.</p>

<p>(<a href="sect128.htm">128</a>) Replaced ‘border ranger’ with ‘Border Ranger’. Replaced ‘Durncrag mountains’ with ‘Durncrag Mountains’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect131.htm">131</a>) Replaced ‘Magicians Guild of Toran’ with ‘Magicians’ Guild of Toran’. Replaced ‘area, and’ with ‘area and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect132.htm">132</a>) Replaced ‘sumptuous Meal’ with ‘sumptuous meal’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect137.htm">137</a>) Replaced ‘20 Gems’ with ‘20 Tomb Guardian Gems’ and ‘mark these on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>’ with ‘mark these on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a single Backpack Item’ based on changes made to the Collector’s Edition.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect142.htm">142</a>) Replaced ‘Durncrag range’ with ‘Durncrag Range’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect144.htm">144</a>) Added ‘ or if you have no Backpack Items’ to the second paragraph. Replaced ‘one Item is stolen’ with ‘one item is stolen’. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect151.htm">151</a>) Added ‘If you wish to remove the pin, turn to 337.’ This is the only other possible choice for what is a strangely one-sided option in the original text. More flavourful language might make more sense, such as ‘If you still wish to remove the pin with your hands,’ but to best preserve the integrity of the text, we simply copied the choice from <a href="sect23.htm">Section 23</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect152.htm">152</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect153.htm">153</a>) Replaced ‘Durncrag range’ with ‘Durncrag Range’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect154.htm">154</a>) Replaced ‘head first’ with ‘head-first’. Replaced ‘last thing you feel are the black shafts’ with ‘last thing you feel is the black shafts’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect163.htm">163</a>) Replaced ‘nearly an half’ with ‘nearly half’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect166.htm">166</a>) Replaced ‘tortuous’ with ‘torturous’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect167.htm">167</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect170.htm">170</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect172.htm">172</a>) Moved the second choice (about the Camouflage Discipline) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect175.htm">175</a>) Moved the last choice (about the Camouflage Discipline) into the first position. Replaced ‘border rangers’ with ‘Border Rangers’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect181.htm">181</a>) Removed ‘You have lost your Weapons and Equipment, but not your life.’ from the end of the second paragraph because it is possible to reach this section of the book without having lost your equipment.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect184.htm">184</a>) Replaced ‘Sword and’ with ‘Sword, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect192.htm">192</a>) Replaced ‘Kraan, and’ with ‘Kraan and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect197.htm">197</a>) Removed a superfluous space after the word ‘wish’ at the very end of the second sentence.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect196.htm">196</a>) Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect200.htm">200</a>) Reversed the order of the choices. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect201.htm">201</a>) Changed the choice that led to <a href="sect215.htm">Section 215</a> to lead to <a href="sect15.htm">Section 15</a> instead. The original choice appears to make sense, but does not work out in a map. The indication that the correct section is really <a href="sect15.htm">15</a> is the fact that it is not otherwise accessible (though <a href="sect215.htm">Section 215</a> is) and <a href="sect15.htm">15</a> leads back to <a href="sect201.htm">Section 201</a> when taking the opposite direction.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect205.htm">205</a>) Added ‘(You must now erase all Weapons and Backpack Items from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)’ in harmony with the Collector’s Edition. Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect211.htm">211</a>) Moved the second choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>

<p>(<a href="sect226.htm">226</a>) Replaced ‘head first’ with ‘head-first’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect228.htm">228</a>) Replaced ‘axe’ with ‘weapon’ because another weapon is available in <a href="sect305.htm">Section 305</a>. Replaced ‘dense, and’ with ‘dense and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect235.htm">235</a>) Moved the last choice (about Tracking) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect236.htm">236</a>) Added ‘(Remember to erase the Vordak Gem from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. If you had two Gems, you need erase only one.)’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect246.htm">246</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect252.htm">252</a>) Replaced ‘men and’ with ‘men, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect254.htm">254</a>) Replaced ‘Durncrag mountains’ with ‘Durncrag Mountains’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect260.htm">260</a>) Replaced ‘spreadeagled’ with ‘spread-eagled’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect267.htm">267</a>) Capitalized ‘message’ in the second sentence of the second paragraph, since that is how retrievable items are supposed to be represented, and to be consistent with the first time the item is mentioned in this section. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect268.htm">268</a>) Replaced ‘wary’ with ‘weary’. We hardly think Lone Wolf would be wary among the King’s soldiers.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect272.htm">272</a>) Replaced ‘wood-smoke’ with ‘wood smoke’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect275.htm">275</a>) Replaced ‘tortuous’ with ‘torturous’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect276.htm">276</a>) Replaced ‘your Axe’ with ‘your weapon’ because another weapon is available in <a href="sect305.htm">Section 305</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect277.htm">277</a>) Replaced ‘<a href="sect113.htm">Turn 113</a>’ to ‘<a href="sect113.htm">Turn to 113</a>.’</p>
<p>(<a href="sect284.htm">284</a>) Replaced both occurrences of ‘Graveweed’ with ‘graveweed’. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption and separated its clauses with a dash instead of a comma.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect291.htm">291</a>) Replaced ‘Spears and’ with ‘Spears, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect295.htm">295</a>) Replaced ‘to try and’ with ‘to try to’.</p>

<p>(<a href="sect304.htm">304</a>) Replaced ‘slip it’ with ‘slip this Vordak Gem’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect307.htm">307</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect311.htm">311</a>) Moved the last choice (about Camouflage) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect315.htm">315</a>) Replaced ‘Items’ with ‘items’.</p>

<p>(<a href="sect323.htm">323</a>) Replaced ‘jet black’ with ‘jet-black’. Replaced ‘ladder, and’ with ‘ladder and’.</p>

<p>(<a href="sect336.htm">336</a>) Replaced ‘unsheath’ with ‘unsheathe’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect341.htm">341</a>) Moved the last choice (about Tracking) into the first position. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>

<p>(<a href="sect343.htm">343</a>) Replaced ‘your Axe and’ with ‘your weapon, and’ because another weapon is available in <a href="sect305.htm">Section 305</a> (and to add a comma).</p>
<p>(<a href="sect347.htm">347</a>) Replaced ‘is a Short Sword and’ with ‘are a Short Sword and’. Replaced ‘One end of the bundle’ with ‘One end of each bundle’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect349.htm">349</a>) ‘Vonatar,’ from the seventh paragraph, is spelled ‘Vonotar’ in later Lone Wolf books. Replaced ‘magician’s guild of Toran’ with ‘Magicians’ Guild of Toran’. Replaced ‘Durncrag range’ with ‘Durncrag Range’. Replaced ‘neck and’ with ‘neck, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="sect350.htm">350</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
