<h3><a name="errintro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>(<a href="sect299.htm">Section 299</a>) The original edition of this book reads: ‘If you wish to give him your Magic Spear, so that he can defend the tunnel entrance, <a href="sect102.htm">turn to 102</a>. If you do not possess a Magic Spear, or do not wish to give it to Rhygar, <a href="sect118.htm">turn to 118</a>.’ Later editions came out reversing these two choices (i.e. the first choice leads to <a href="sect118.htm">Section 118</a>, the second choice to <a href="sect102.htm">Section 102</a>). Both of these versions are very problematic to game flow and inspired a controversy among the members of Project Aon. The version that you see in our text is a mixed scenario intended to most closely match the author’s surmised original intention, even though it does not appear in either previously published version.</p>
<p>If you wish to use either of the previously published versions, then refer to the appropriate choice as listed here. Discussion of the different versions follows:</p>
<p>Original version: The choices appear to serve no other purpose other than punishing Lone Wolf with certain death for mercifully handing Rhygar the Spear. The fact that this version was revised and the path that Lone Wolf is given in the <cite>Legends of Lone Wolf</cite> series also both appear to refute the correctness of this version.</p>
<p>Revised version: Under this version, it is impossible for Lone Wolf to succeed without taking the left path back at the beginning of the Durenor Forest (<a href="sect150.htm">Section 150</a>), ignoring the warning of the Szalls, and fighting the Helghast. This directly contradicts the statement in <a href="kaiwisdm.htm">Kai Wisdom</a> that a wise choice of Disciplines enables you to succeed regardless of your starting <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> scores.</p>
