<h3>53</h3>

<p>You hear whispering among the crew and catch the words ‘ghost-ships’ and ‘cursed voyage’, but the whispering stops when the captain’s voice calls for all hands on deck. A silence descends on the <cite>Green Sceptre</cite> as Captain Kelman addresses the crew in a loud voice.</p>
<p>‘Men, we are three days’ sail from Port Bax, but with a strong wind and a stout heart we’ll drop anchor and feast there in two. The fire has claimed many of our provisions and rations are hereby cut to one meal a day. A guard shall be placed upon the freshwater cask. But we are strong. We shall endure. Any man found thieving will receive a hundred lashes. That is all.’ The crew seem unhappy at the captain’s decision, but none of them dares to challenge his authority.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, you are invited by both the crew and by the captain to take your evening meal with them.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to eat with the captain, <a href="sect321.htm">turn to 321</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to eat with the crew, <a href="sect154.htm">turn to 154</a>.</p>
