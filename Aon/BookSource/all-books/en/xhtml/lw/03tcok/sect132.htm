<h3>132</h3>

<p>Unless you have just eaten, you lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points from hunger.<sup><a href="#sect132-1-foot" name="sect132-1">3</a></sup> You continue along the tunnel for over a mile, but you soon become tired and stop to sleep. You awake feeling refreshed, but have no idea just how long you have been sleeping—the light of these caverns never changes, be it day or night.</p>
<p>You continue onwards, mile after mile, passing through a series of huge ice halls containing towering pillars of crystal. In one vast chamber, you are mesmerized by the beautiful sight of a shimmering crystal ceiling. But beyond this chamber lies an even greater spectacle. A narrow passage leads on to a ledge running around the brink of a huge chasm, over half a mile wide. As you edge your way around this awesome void, you try not to look down into its windswept depths, many miles below.</p>
<p>You have been on the ledge for only a few minutes when a noise behind you makes you glance back. To your horror, you see you are being followed by a monstrous, two-headed serpent.</p>
