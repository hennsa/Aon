<h3>328</h3>

<p>In spite of his frail physique, the man climbs with surprising speed and dexterity. You pull him through the portal and retrieve your Rope. ‘The stairs,’ he says, pointing into the darkness. ‘Our escape lies that way, but you had best take the lead; my eyes ail me. I have suffered the snow-blindness and my vision is just a blur.’</p>
<p>You pack your Rope and lead the way along the passage. You are about to descend the stairs when a pair of skeletal hands close around your throat from behind. A hideous cry betrays the ‘merchant’s’ true identity. He is a Helghast, a deadly shape-changing servant of the Darklords, and he has tricked you into releasing him from his cell. He is intent on murdering you.</p>
<p>You desperately gasp for air as the skeletal fingers tear and burn at your throat. You lose 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If you are still alive, you can break free from his steely grip. You must now fight this creature to the death. Due to the surprise of the Helghast’s attack and the injury it has inflicted on your throat, you are unable to swallow any potions prior to the combat.</p>
