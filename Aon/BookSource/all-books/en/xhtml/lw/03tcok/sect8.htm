<h3>8</h3>

<p>The smell is revolting, and you try desperately to hold your breath as you smear handfuls of the slimy grease inside your jacket. As the oil penetrates your skin, you feel a warm glow as if you were near a fire: the more grease you apply, the warmer you become. You also notice that the awful smell is gradually fading. (Note the fact that you have applied Baknar oil on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> although it does not take up any space and only applies for the duration of this adventure.)</p>
<p>‘When it soaks into your skin, you lose your sense of smell,’ says Fenor.</p>
<p>‘Just as well,’ replies Dyce. ‘I don’t think I could stand living with myself otherwise!’</p>
<p>Baknar oil gives excellent insulation from the bitter cold of Kalte, and it may save you valuable <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points in the near future.</p>
<p>Irian regains consciousness and is soon scooping out the Baknar carcass for himself. Light is now fading fast and you decide to pitch camp in this narrow pass. You prepare a meal, and then you each take it in turns to sit watch, just in case the Baknar decide to return.</p>
