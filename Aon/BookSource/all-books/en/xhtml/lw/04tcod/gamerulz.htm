<h2>The Game Rules</h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and physical stamina—<span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of 14). When you fight, your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points, and Kai Disciplines which you can now carry over with you to Book 4. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You may choose one bonus <a href="discplnz.htm">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure you have successfully completed; then read the <a href="equipmnt.htm">section on equipment</a> for Book 4 carefully.</p>
