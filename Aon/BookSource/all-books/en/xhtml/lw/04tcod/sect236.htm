<h3>236</h3>

<p>You are approaching a large outbuilding when you hear a muffled voice. Suddenly the door bursts open to reveal two bandit warriors, their bows raised; arrows fly and rangers fall from their horses. Drawing your weapon, you charge your attackers, but the other bandits appear from every side, and your men are caught in a murderous crossfire.</p>
<p>However, the speed of your attack panics the bowmen. They turn to run but you cut them down before they have taken a few steps. Then a dark-skinned warrior with black oily hair appears at a window opposite. He flicks his hand, and a knife thuds into your arm. You lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Gritting your teeth, you wrench the blade free and hurl it back. The bandit dies instantly. Clutching your wounded arm, you stagger through the building and escape through a rear door. The land that faces you now is steep and heavily forested.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to run straight into the forest, <a href="sect123.htm">turn to 123</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you want to change direction as soon as you are hidden from sight, <a href="sect169.htm">turn to 169</a>.</p>
