<h3>311</h3>

<p>Three Sommlending soldiers come to your aid. Their swords slice into the evil Warhounds until both dogs stiffen and die, and you thankfully stagger to your feet and try to assess the situation as the battle rages all around. Sommlending soldiers still man the barricade, forming in groups that hold firm where the wall does not. Spears and arrows arc through the sky piercing metal, wood, and flesh. Men fall from their horses, horses scream and bolt, and the dead and the wounded lie everywhere.</p>
<p>The Warhounds have been driven back upon the spears of their masters, who now advance behind a wall of shields. To your right, a bandit warrior is trying to jump his horse across the barricade, but the animal is wounded and near to death. It cannot make the jump; the rider is hurled forwards over the wall, falling close behind you.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the bandit warrior, <a href="sect90.htm">turn to 90</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to rally the Sommlending soldiers to repel the advancing spearmen, <a href="sect3.htm">turn to 3</a>.</p>
