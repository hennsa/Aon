<h3>70</h3>

<p>Your passage through the trees is lit by the flickering glow of the campfires that line the highway. Bandit warriors huddle round drawing warmth and comfort from the flames. They take little interest in their guard duties, and you find it easy to avoid their patrols.</p>
<p>By morning, you have reached the edge of the forest. You stare out across the fields of crops towards a small village that lies at the base of a shallow valley. The fields are only separated by narrow tracks, and these are alive with flying insects, hovering in swarms. You are walking along one of these tracks when suddenly you spot bandits ahead. They are wandering idly up the track towards you, their spears slung over their shoulders.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess an Onyx Medallion, <a href="sect305.htm">turn to 305</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Kai Discipline of Camouflage and have reached the Kai Rank of Guardian or higher, <a href="sect49.htm">turn to 49</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not have this Special Item or this Discipline and Kai Rank, dive into the tall crops and hide by <a href="sect159.htm">turning to 159</a>.</p>
