<h3>145</h3>

<p>You wade into the water, thick with scum, and try not to breathe through your nose. The glutinous mire is clotted with green and black filth, and with your every movement the surface cracks, releasing a vile gas. You cover your mouth with your Kai cloak, but the appalling stench makes you retch and choke. A loud splash behind you warns that Maouk’s men are not far away, and you quicken your step. At regular intervals, circular chutes disappear into the ceiling. Many are stained bright yellow, white, or reddish-brown. This section of the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i> passes beneath the Linen Quarter of Barrakeesh, where the Guild of Linen-weavers operate their fuller’s shops. The chutes dump waste dyes straight into the sewer, making the oily water even more garish in colour.</p>
<p>You spot a ripple in the water ahead. It moves nearer, the wake of a submerged sewer creature. Instinctively, you flatten yourself against the dye-stained wall as you feel the movement of water against your waist, and watch in fear and fascination as the ripple of water disappears into the tunnel. Suddenly, a fearful scream bursts out of the darkness; Maouk has lost one of his men. The terrible cries of the Sharnazim warrior chill your spine, but your instincts tell you to press on while you have the advantage. The channel soon reaches a junction where another tunnel heads off to the west.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter the new tunnel, <a href="sect108.htm">turn to 108</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue northwards, <a href="sect70.htm">turn to 70</a>.</p>
