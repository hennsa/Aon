<h3>244</h3>

<p>You can clearly see the main highway that links Chula to the capital. It crosses the desolate salt plain of Lake Inrahim by means of a causeway thirty feet high and is a useful landmark by which you can steer. Little stone houses with beaten earth roofs are grouped in small clusters along the highway, their numbers increasing as you draw nearer to the town.</p>
<p>You are five miles from Chula, when you notice a dark cloud hovering several hundred feet above one of the small villages. It is a cloud of Kraan; they are moving to intercept you.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Itikar squeals in pain, and a splash of feathers billows out from its wing. A Kraan has closed in from behind; it is less than a hundred yards distant. The Drakkarim rider holsters an empty bronze crossbow and draws his black sword. His bolt has passed through the wing of your mount, and he prepares to strike as the Itikar loses height and speed.</p>
<p class="combat">Drakkarim Kraan-rider: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 20   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 28</p>
<p>The Kraan and its rider are swooping on you from behind. You will only be able to fight for one round of combat before they are carried past by the momentum of their attack.</p>
<p class="choice">If you lose more <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points than the enemy in this one round combat, <a href="sect347.htm">turn to 347</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the enemy loses more <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points than you, <a href="sect327.htm">turn to 327</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you both lose exactly the same number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points, <a href="sect271.htm">turn to 271</a>.</p>
