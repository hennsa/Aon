<h3>291</h3>

<p>You learn that the dwarves were once the crew of a more conventional vessel, a merchantman that sailed the Tentarias of southern Magnamund. The Tentarias is a vast expanse of lakes and land-locked seas, which connect to form a continuous canal stretching nearly three thousand miles. They were created, as was the Rymerift of Durenor, by a massive landslide. Three years ago, the dwarves’ former captain, a dwarf named Quan, lost his ship, cargo, and crew whilst gambling at cards; it seems the unfortunate captain was unaware of Banedon’s true profession until it was far too late. As a result, Banedon became the dwarves’ captain, and ever since they have adventured with him across the lands and skies of Southern Magnamund. The <cite>Skyrider</cite> itself was given to Banedon by the Magicians of Dessi, in return for his help in defeating the Gagadoth—a monstrous creature that terrorized their land, over which their own sorcery could not prevail.</p>
<p>The <cite>Skyrider</cite> was travelling from Dessi on its way to Barrakeesh when you appeared. The dwarves have overheard your talk with Banedon and are excited by the prospects of a new adventure. They seem undaunted by the deadly dangers that it will certainly involve.</p>
