<h3>371</h3>

<p>The axe howls through the dark; you sidestep, guided only by instinct, for you cannot see the lethal axe-blade, which hurtles towards you. Black steel bites into your side, the sudden pain making you gasp in shocked surprise. You clutch at your wounded ribs to feel warm blood oozing through your fingers. Lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>A deafening <i>bang</i> rings out and the Drakkar is flung backwards, his breastplate torn open by dwarf shot. He screams a long, agonizing death-cry as he disappears from sight, tumbling into the darkness, which surrounds the speeding skyship. From Barrakeesh, a roll of thunder rumbles across the dark plain, full of brooding menace, as if the city itself were cursing your escape.</p>
<p>Banedon appears at your side, his face lined with concern. As he offers a shaky hand to help you to your feet, you notice that the makeshift bandage which binds his wound is soaked with blood. He is weak and pale, and close to collapse.</p>
