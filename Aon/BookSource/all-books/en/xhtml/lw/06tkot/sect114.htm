<h3>114</h3>

<p>You silence the robber’s whispered threats, slamming your clenched fist into his throat and at the same time grabbing hold of his tunic with your other hand. He tries to scream but his larynx has been crushed by your blow. He gurgles pitifully as you twist him around to shield yourself as his accomplice lunges with his dagger. It sinks deeply into the robber’s heart, and as he slumps to his knees, you draw your own weapon and attack his startled killer. Due to the surprise of your attack, you may add 2 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the first round of combat.</p>
<p class="combat">Backstabber: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 15   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 22</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect88.htm">turn to 88</a>.</p>
