<h3>14</h3>

<p>Suddenly, the riders appear and spread out in a semicircle to surround you. ‘We have a debt to settle, Northlander,’ hisses Roark, his lips drawn back from his teeth in a contemptuous sneer. ‘I demand payment in full!’</p>
<p>Madness flashes in his glaring eyes as he removes an amulet from around his neck and holds it high in the air.</p>
<p>‘Come, come Tagazin, I summon thee. From the pit of eternal pain, I summon thee!’</p>
<p>The skin on your arms and neck prickles with dread at the sound of Roark’s terrible invocation, and you cast your eyes around you for an escape route. Only the churchyard offers a way past Roark and his men, but as you spur your horse through the stone gateway, you are suddenly frozen with terror by what you see before you.</p>
