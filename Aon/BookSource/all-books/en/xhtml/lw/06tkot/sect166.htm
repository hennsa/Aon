<h3>166</h3>

<p>Valiantly your horse attempts to clear the high-sided wagon, but the long day’s ride has taken its toll. Suddenly you are thrown forward in the saddle as its forelegs crash against the wagon’s rail. You cling desperately to the reins as your terrified horse scatters the cargo and then lands with a tremendous crash on the cobblestoned street. You manage to regain control and spur her along the winding street that leads away from the square. Only when the curses of the town guard can no longer be heard do you rein in your terrified and exhausted mare and take stock of her injuries. The forelegs are bruised, but the skin is not broken. With a good night’s rest she should be perfectly all right by morning.</p>
<p>As you remount, you discover to your dismay that the flap of your Backpack is unbuckled. A quick check reveals that two items are missing, which fell from your pack during the jump. Erase any two Backpack Items from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
