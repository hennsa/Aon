<h3>195</h3>

<p>Suddenly, you sense that you are in grave peril, and you listen carefully at the keyhole to determine what is being said by the preacher.</p>
<p>‘… and so I beseech you, my brothers, do not listen to Gwynian’s foolish and dangerous theory. The star that shone in the night is a warning to us to guard our knowledge, to keep safe the secret of the Lorestone. We must stop all those who would use its power for their own wicked ends.’</p>
<p>The preacher’s words are answered by loud chanting: ‘Keep the secret, keep the secret, keep the secret!’</p>
<p>The sound of a key in the lock makes you start. The meeting has come to an end, and the congregation are preparing to leave. Quickly, you sprint away and take cover in a darkened doorway. The brown-robed men pour out of the temple and disperse, but a small group are heading towards your hiding place; if you stay where you are you will be seen for sure. Without a second thought, you push open the door and enter.</p>
