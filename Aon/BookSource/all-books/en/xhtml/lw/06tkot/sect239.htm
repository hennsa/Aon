<h3>239</h3>

<p>As you wait, Cyrilus becomes agitated. You sense that he is scared to be left on his own after his encounter with Roark. ‘Are you bound for Varetta?’ he asks. ‘Perhaps we could share the journey? I am bound for the capital in the morning. I know the road very well and I know its dangers—it would not be wise to travel alone on such a road.’</p>
<p>You pause to consider the prospect of sharing your journey with this old man. On the one hand his company would make the miles seem shorter, but on the other hand, he could prove to be a burden and slow you down. You are about to decline when he says something that convinces you to share the journey.</p>
