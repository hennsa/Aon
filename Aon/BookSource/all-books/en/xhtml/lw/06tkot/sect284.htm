<h3>284</h3>

<p>A huge, fat-bellied mercenary is standing on a wooden box near the door, taking bets from the crowd of gold-hungry soldiers while his assistants are busy drumming up business in the hall for their master. One of the grimy-faced boys approaches and asks you for your stake.</p>
<p>Firstly, decide how many Gold Crowns you wish to stake on the event and note this sum in the margin of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>—there is a maximum bet of 10 Gold Crowns. Next, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and note this as well. Pick another number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add 3 to it.</p>
<p>If the first number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> is higher than the second total, you win the bet. Multiply your stake money by 2 to determine how much you have won (the odds are two to one). If the second number is higher than the first, the rider has successfully skewered all the fruit without killing any of the men, and your stake money is lost.</p>
<p>You may bet up to three times on this game, or quit at any stage.</p>
<p class="choice">If you quit during the event, <a href="sect336.htm">turn to 336</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you bet on all three rounds and have not lost all of your Gold Crowns by the end, <a href="sect347.htm">turn to 347</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you lose all your Gold Crowns, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
