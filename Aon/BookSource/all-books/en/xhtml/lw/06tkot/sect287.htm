<h3>287</h3>

<p>You leave your horse tied to a post beside the hut and approach the door. Cyrilus is announcing his arrival by rapping on the Denka Gate with his staff and shouting to his brother to open up. You chuckle at his growing impatience as he hammers at the gate; if his brother is anything like Cyrilus, he is probably fast asleep.</p>
<p>Inside the hut you are greeted by the mouth-watering smell of freshly baked bread. Pyramids of loaves are stacked high in hampers and trays of pies, flans, cakes, and biscuits cover the counter. There is nobody here, but an open door reveals another room at the back of the hut.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to call for service, <a href="sect43.htm">turn to 43</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to help yourself to some bread and cakes, <a href="sect157.htm">turn to 157</a>.</p>
