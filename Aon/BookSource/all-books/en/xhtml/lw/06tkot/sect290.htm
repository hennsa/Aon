<h3>290</h3>

<p>You ride into Eula at the captain’s side, his banner emblazoned with a flaming battle-axe fluttering overhead. The town has been turned into a huge army encampment; its people have long since fled to the north, abandoning their homes and livestock to the gold-hungry soldiers. Men from a dozen nations rub shoulders with warriors of less-than-human origins, united by common greed. The captain turns to the south where the highway is clogged with foot soldiers. As you catch your first glimpse of Tekaro, burning beneath a pall of black smoke, your heart sinks. This is where the Lorestone lies, in a city under siege from an army of ten thousand fighting men.</p>
<p>As you approach a tangle of siege-works at the bank of the River Quarl, the captain points to an encampment in a field to your left where a blue flag with a gold eagle flutters in the soot-laden air.</p>
<p>‘Prince Ewevin’s standard,’ he says. ‘The time has come to meet our paymaster.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stay with the captain’s company, <a href="sect204.htm">turn to 204</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide the time has come for you to leave the mercenaries, <a href="sect280.htm">turn to 280</a>.</p>
