<h3>322</h3>

<p>‘My humble apologies, sergeant,’ you say, hoping to avoid confrontation and the possibility of a fight. ‘After so many years away from home, I am impatient to see my family.’</p>
<p>The sergeant lowers his spear but continues to eye you suspiciously. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Invisibility, you have imitated the thin nasal sound of the Quarlen dialect to perfection, but the sergeant is still wary. However, he gradually relaxes his guard, and the sneer is replaced by a smile on his battle-scarred face.</p>
<p>‘We have a special toll for the likes of you who forget their native manners—10 Gold Crowns,’ he says, a gloved hand held out in expectation.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to pay the sergeant 10 Gold Crowns, <a href="sect332.htm">turn to 332</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose not to pay and decide to evade the sergeant while his guard is down by jumping the wagons, <a href="sect72.htm">turn to 72</a>.</p>
