<div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-1">1</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) The Lantern is designed to be self-lighting. You will not need a Tinderbox or any other means of creating a flame to light it.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect11.htm#sect11-1">2</a>]  (<a href="sect11.htm">Section 11</a>) For those who cannot use the illustration of the plaque or those who don’t have access to it, we offer the following description.</p><p>The plaque can be formed in the following way. A regular hexagon (i.e. a six-sided shape with all sides of equal length and all angles equal) is divided into six equal triangles by three lines which extend from each corner to its opposite (i.e. one line for each of three pairs of opposite corners). A larger triangle is formed from the hexagon by placing three triangles (of the same size and shape as the triangles in the hexagon) next to three alternating sides of the hexagon (i.e. if the sides of the hexagon are numbered 1–6, then the sides of the triangles should be attached to sides 2, 4, and 6).</p>
<p>Alternately, the plaque could be formed from equilateral triangles (i.e. triangles with three equal sides) in the following way. A single triangle is placed on the plaque with one of its corners pointing down. Three new triangles are attached to the sides of the first triangle. The result so far should resemble a large triangle with one corner pointing up. Two more small triangles (pointing down) are attached to the bottom of this large triangle. Finally, three new triangles (pointing up) are attached to the latest two so that, all together, the plaque forms one large triangle.</p>
<p>The final, triangular plaque has five interlocking rows of small triangles. Starting from the top, it has a row of one triangle pointing up, a row of one triangle pointing down, a row of two triangles pointing up, a row of two triangles pointing down, and a row of three triangles pointing up.</p>

Should it be used in combat by anyone who is not a Kai Lord, its power will fade and be lost forever. The Dwarf in <cite>Castle Death</cite> did not use the Sommerswerd in combat, and therefore its power has not been diminished as a result.’</p></div>
