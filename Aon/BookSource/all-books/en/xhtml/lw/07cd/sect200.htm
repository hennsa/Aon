<h3>200</h3>

<p>Chunks of stone and iron are blasted into the upper reaches of the throne-hall by the increasing power of the eruptions. Boulders, some the size of horses, seem to tumble in slow motion all around the beam as you are drawn irresistibly nearer to the roof. Suddenly the beam fades and you find yourself standing on a circular plinth in the centre of a ruined temple near to the gatehouse of the castle keep. The glare of daylight blinds you, but as you gradually become accustomed to it you cast your eyes over the shimmering waters of Lake Khor to the town of Herdos, perched on the horizon. The walls of the fortress are beginning to crack and slant. Buildings are crumbling, and the ground is alive with constant vibration. You run through the ruined main gate as bolts of lightning are drawn from the sky by the dying power of Kazan-Oud.</p>
<p>At the top of a ruined staircase you stare down at the lake far below.</p>

<p class="choice">If you choose to make your way to the beach, <a href="sect309.htm">turn to 309</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to dive from the cliff into the water far below, <a href="sect254.htm">turn to 254</a>.</p>
