<h3>31</h3>

<p>Your attack is swift and deadly. You dispatch all three of them in as many blows and cover their dead bodies with a tapestry torn from the wall. There is nothing of value in the pockets of their robes, but lying on the table, you find a Skeleton Key and a Parchment. Both items look as if they could be of use, and you decide to keep them. (Mark them as Special Items on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, to be kept in the pocket of your tunic.)</p>
<p>You leave the chamber, but as soon as you set foot into the corridor beyond, you are confronted by an armoured guard. He screams a cry that is muffled by the visor of his helmet and turns to run towards a bell-rope hanging from a hole in the ceiling.</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not have a Bow, or if you do not wish to use it, <a href="sect40.htm">turn to 40</a>.</p>
