<h3>79</h3>

<p>Horror twists the warrior’s face as your Arrow whistles through the air. He opens his mouth to scream, but the cry dies in his throat as your shaft buries itself deep in his chest. He staggers, his arms outstretched as if to grab at a rail, and tumbles from the walkway into the smoky chasm.</p>
<p>A hungry shriek resounds from the arch. You draw another Arrow and take aim at the darkness as a murmur of low mutterings becomes audible. The sounds chill you. Gurgling and hissing through clenched teeth, three creatures, their skins as black as night, creep from the shadows and fix you with terrible fiery eyes. They cackle repulsively and slink forward with long loping strides.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to kill all three with your Bow, <a href="sect328.htm">turn to 328</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to shoulder your Bow and evade them by escaping into the archway opposite, <a href="sect241.htm">turn to 241</a>.</p>
