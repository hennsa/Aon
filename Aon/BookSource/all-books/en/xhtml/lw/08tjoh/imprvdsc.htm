<h3>Improved Disciplines</h3>

<p>As you rise through the levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills) or Tutelary (five skills) you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>
<h4><a name="primate">Primate</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Primates with this Magnakai Discipline will be able to repel an animal that is intent on harming them by blocking its sense of taste and smell. The level of success is dependent on the size and ferocity of the animal.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill will have the ability to delay the effect of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison, he will be able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and are able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Primates with the skill of Nexus will be able to offer a far greater resistance than before to the effects of noxious gases and fumes.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="tutelary">Tutelary</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to use defensive combat skills to great effect when fighting unarmed. When entering combat without a weapon, you will lose only 2 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, instead of the usual 4 points.</dd>
<dt>Invisibility</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to increase the effectiveness of their skill by drawing the enemy’s attention to a place other than that in which they are hiding. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill can detect an enemy ambush within 500 yards of their position unless their <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score is low due to wounds sustained or lack of food.</dd>
<dt>Psi-screen</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill develop mental defences against magical charms and hostile telepathy. These defences increase in strength as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Divination</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries who possess this Magnakai Discipline are able to recognize objects or creatures with magical skills or abilities, although they may not be able to if the creature or object is shielded from detection.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Magnakai Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books.</p>
