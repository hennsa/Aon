<h3>10</h3>

<p>A stronger pulse and the appearance of sweat on his brow are the first two outward signs of Paido’s recovery. Slowly he stirs to consciousness, waking from a sleep that was so nearly his last. He can remember nothing of the ordeal, and when you tell him what has happened he shakes his head in disbelief. ‘A Helghast?’ he says, incredulous. ‘How can that be?’</p>
<p>‘The servants of Darklord Gnaag have infiltrated this monastery,’ you reply. ‘They have kept themselves hidden, but I fear the day fast approaches when they will rise up and wreak their havoc. Already they know our true identities, and I wager they know why we’re here.’</p>
<p>‘This is bitter news, Lone Wolf,’ says Paido, his face etched with worry. ‘We can afford to delay no longer. If Talestria falls to Darklord Gnaag before we reach the Danarg, then the quest is lost.’</p>
<p>It is a sobering thought, but you do not dwell on it. Quickly you help Paido to his feet and cast your eyes around the cellar in search of another exit.</p>
