<h3>177</h3>

<p>When Paido finally climbs down from the tree, his face betrays his anxiety. ‘What is wrong?’ you ask impatiently.</p>
<p>‘There is no signal,’ he replies. ‘I have scanned every direction with the starguider, but it can detect no korlinium signal. It isn’t damaged, of that I’m sure. It’s simply as if the temple has disappeared.’</p>
<p>You take the device from Paido’s hand and climb the twisted tree trunk. He shouts instructions and you set the starguider into operation, scanning the distant horizon and waiting for the tell-tale <i>click</i> that will reveal the direction of the lost temple of the Elder Magi. But Paido is right—there is no signal; and without a signal there is no hope of finding the Lorestone of Ohrido.</p>
<p>You are about to abandon the search and jump down from the tree when you see something on the northern horizon that you hadn’t noticed before. An island of red volcanic rock rises out of the mire, one of four flat-topped islands grouped in a diamond close to the eastern edge of the crater. Perhaps the temple is on the other side of that island. Perhaps that is why the starguider will emit no signal?</p>
<p>You climb down and ask Paido what he thinks. He stares to the north and ponders the problem. ‘Yes, it is possible,’ he says thoughtfully, ‘it is just possible.’</p>
