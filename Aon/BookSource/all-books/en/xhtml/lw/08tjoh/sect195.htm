<h3>195</h3>

<p>The Helghast vents a cry of rage and despair as you strike the blow that seals its doom. It crumples and falls, its flesh transforming into a vile green gas. All that remains is the torn and shredded robe that once concealed its identity.</p>
<p>Your mind reels at what has just occurred, but you dare not dwell on the fearful implications, for you can make out the sound of feet running down the stairs beyond the locked refectory door. You rush to Paido’s side and shake him, trying desperately to revive him. He groans, his head lolling from side to side as you drag him to his feet. There is now only one escape route from the refectory—the hatch in the wall that leads to the kitchens. You lift Paido across your shoulder and bundle him through the narrow opening. But, before you can pull yourself through, the door slams open and a rush of monks pour into the refectory.</p>

<p class="choice">If you wish to stand and fight the monks, <a href="sect110.htm">turn to 110</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to ignore them and clamber through the hatch, <a href="sect86.htm">turn to 86</a>.</p>
