<h3>239</h3>

<p>The light fades and you step down from the dais, your senses aglow with a newfound wisdom and strength. Having witnessed the fulfilment of your quest, Paido beams with joy as you return to his side. He congratulates you and bids you follow as he turns towards an archway of silver set into the crystal walls of the chamber. ‘Come, Lone Wolf. We have a long journey ahead of us. We must leave without delay.’</p>
<p>The thought of returning to the dangers of the Danarg fills you with dread. Paido senses your anxiety. ‘Don’t look so dismayed,’ he says, still smiling. ‘This temple will provide the means for our safe return, you will see.’ Intrigued by his answer, you follow in silence as he leads you through the archway and up a long flight of marble stairs to another chamber, also constructed of crystal but veined with a marble that glistens like liquid fire. It is solid korlinium. At the centre of the chamber, its hull resting on a cradle of steel, is a Levitron—an ancient skyship. Like everything else that you have seen in this wondrous temple, the craft is untarnished by time. Paido ushers you aboard and prepares to power the craft. A shudder runs through the hull as the engines rise in pitch and slowly it lifts from its bed of steel. The chamber is built in the spire of the temple and the roof now slides open to allow the Levitron to rise into the darkening sky above the Danarg.</p>
<p>Paido sets the controls and sets the ship’s starguider on a course for Elzian. Then he joins you at the bow-rail for one last look at the Temple of Ohrido. It glows red in the light of the setting sun, but the shimmering glow is blemished by shadows that swoop back and forth across its tiers. You assume it is just a trick of the twilight, until your ears are filled by a sudden and terrifying shriek.</p>
