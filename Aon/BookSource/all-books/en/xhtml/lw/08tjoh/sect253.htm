<h3>253</h3>

<p>The man springs to his feet and unhooks an axe from his belt in readiness for combat. He wears a knee-length surcoat of scarlet cloth over a suit of heavy chainmail, and upon his chest is emblazoned a crest depicting a castle and an open hand. Paido hesitates, not from fear of his opponent, but because he has suddenly recognized the uniform of a soldier of the Tharro garrison.</p>
<p>‘There’ll be no fightin’ on board my barge!’ booms the angry voice of the captain. ‘Sheathe y’weapons or I’ll shine some daylight through yer gizzards!’</p>
<p>The captain stands at the foot of the tap-room stairs, a hollow tube of steel clutched in his hoary hands. Most of the passengers now have their fingers jammed in their ears in case he should fire his primitive-but-deadly Bor musket. Paido lowers his sword and apologizes for his rashness. He offers the soldier an ale and the man accepts—but on one condition—that it is not a mug of Ferina Nog!</p>
