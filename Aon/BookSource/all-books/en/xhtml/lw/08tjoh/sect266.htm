<h3>266</h3>

<p>You stare across the lush open plains that border the river, contemplating the quest that lies ahead. A flock of long-necked okrils fly overhead, their melodic call echoing across the grasslands as they return to their nests at the river’s edge. Paido sits silently beside you at the prow, his thoughts, like yours, on the perils of the Danarg that have yet to be faced.</p>
<p>The sun is low in the sky when you catch sight of Tharro, its mud-coloured walls—thick, high, and crenellated—dominating the hill on which it was built centuries ago. The barge passes beneath a stout wooden bridge, supported by rough-hewn pillars of stone, along a canal running parallel to the river, and draws to a halt before two massive metal-bound doors which span the waterway. You collect your horses and disembark with the other mounted passengers, riding in line towards the fortified town gate. At first you are turned away by the guards, but when you show your pass, signed and sealed by Lord Adamas, you are both ushered to the front of the queue and saluted like lords as you ride through the archway and into the square beyond. Three streets converge at the river gate square: Copperpiece Lane, Globe Walk, and Flagon Alley.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go west into Copperpiece Lane, <a href="sect35.htm">turn to 35</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go north into Globe Walk, <a href="sect82.htm">turn to 82</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go northwest into Flagon Alley, <a href="sect332.htm">turn to 332</a>.</p>
