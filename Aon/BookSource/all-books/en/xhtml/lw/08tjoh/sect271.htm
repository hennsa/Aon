<h3>271</h3>

<p>You and Paido bid farewell to Lord Adamas and spur your horses along the wide paved street towards the city’s gatehouse. The wagon-worn highway leads to the village of Sharr, a small, wood-walled enclave of fishermen and bargees, built around a great stone bridge which spans the River Phoen. You leave the highway and follow a twisting path down to the river’s edge. There a barge is ready to leave for Tharro; its team of ghorkas are harnessed and the crew are preparing to cast off the thick rope hawsers securing the barge to the quay.</p>
<p>The captain sees you approach and calls to his men, ‘Hold fast, lads! Looks like we’ve two more for Tharro.’</p>
<p>A gangplank is lowered and the crew guide your horses aboard. As you dismount the captain strides along the bleached wood deck and greets you like an old friend, shaking both of you warmly by the hand. ‘Lord Adamas sent word to expect two riders for this trip, though I’d almost given up waiting for you to show. He’s paid your fares and he said you may be wantin’ some privacy, so I’ve set aside a cabin at the stern. My lads will see to your horses.’</p>
<p>The captain points to the rear of the barge where two sets of stairs descend below the deck. ‘Take the stairs on your left; your cabin is the door at the end of the gangway. If you be wantin’ some food or ale, there’s a tap-room in the hold—just take the stairs on the right.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to inspect your cabin, <a href="sect53.htm">turn to 53</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the tap-room, <a href="sect151.htm">turn to 151</a>.</p>
