<h3>313</h3>

<p>You leap over the twitching body of the Xlorg and help Paido, who is being forced perilously close to the pool’s edge by three more of the growling swamp creatures. You strike from behind, breaking the back of one with your downstroke and opening the side of another as you swing your weapon clear.</p>
<p>Paido falls, clutching an arm deeply torn by needle-sharp talons. His attacker turns on you, darting its head towards your throat with lightning speed. Its jaws gape wide as it lashes out with a sticky tongue, spraying your eyes with stinging saliva. Instinctively you bend forward, your hands wiping the spittle from your face, a reflex action which saves you from the creature’s grip as it leaps forward to strangle you. Suddenly it lets out a gurgling croak and falls forward with a thick splash. You stagger back and open your bloodshot eyes to see it lying face down in the mire with Paido’s dagger embedded in its back. ‘Look out!’ screams your companion, as the last of the Xlorg attacks you from behind.</p>
