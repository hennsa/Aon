<h3>323</h3>

<p>Your Arrow fells the leading monk, pinning his forearm to his chest. The others falter, stepping back to stare at their slain brother and the smouldering remains of the Helghast. ‘What manner of demon are you?’ asks one, incredulously.</p>
<p>‘A murdering sorcerer!’ says the monk at his side.</p>
<p>‘A soulless butcher!’ accuses another.</p>
<p>For all their bitterness you sense that these monks were unaware of their leader’s true identity. They believe you came here tonight to murder their master, and his smoking remains convince them that you have accomplished your goal. Before you can utter a word, they draw short swords and attack you, raving like men possessed.</p>
<p class="combat">Monks of the Sword: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 24   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 42</p>
<p>Owing to the swiftness of their attack, you must fight the first two rounds of combat unarmed before you are able to draw a hand weapon. Because of their state of frenzy, they are immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge).</p>
<p class="choice">You may evade after three rounds of combat by pulling yourself through the hatch; <a href="sect191.htm">turn to 191</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect293.htm">turn to 293</a>.</p>
