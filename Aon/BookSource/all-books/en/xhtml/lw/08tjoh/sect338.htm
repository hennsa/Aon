<h3>338</h3>

<p>‘And finally, for my last puzzle, I offer this beautiful treasure,’ he says, as he draws a small silver box inlaid with pearls from the pocket of his robes. ‘This priceless artefact was stolen from the treasure hoard of Valborg the Enchanter,’ he exclaims.</p>
<p>On hearing this wondrous revelation the tap-room comes alive with excited chatter. You are inclined to disbelieve the tale of the box’s origin but, nevertheless, it is a beautiful object and is undoubtedly worth at least 100 Lune, perhaps more.</p>
<p>Silence descends on the hold as all await the Count’s final puzzle. ‘When I was last in the market of Garthen,’ the Count begins, ‘I asked an egg trader how many eggs he had sold that day. He replied: “My first customer said that he would buy half my eggs and half an egg more. My second and third customers said exactly the same thing. When I had filled all three orders I was completely sold out of eggs and yet I hadn’t broken a single egg all day.” How many eggs had the egg trader sold in all?’</p>
<p class="puzzle">If you can answer the egg riddle, <a href="numbered.htm">turn to the entry number</a> that is the same number as the answer.<sup><a href="#sect338-1-foot" name="sect338-1">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you cannot answer the riddle, <a href="sect133.htm">turn to 133</a>.</p>
