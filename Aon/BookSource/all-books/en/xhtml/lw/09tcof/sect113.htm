<h3>113</h3>

<p>A guard pushes open the enclosure gate and motions you to leave. You are free to enter the city, but your horses are impounded. You protest and demand that they be returned, but to no avail. ‘Order of the Senate,’ says the commander, offhandedly, ‘an emergency decree. All horses belonging to the civil population must be delivered into the care of the garrison stables until the state of emergency is lifted.’</p>
<p>Reluctantly you allow the guards to take your steeds and, as they are being led away, the commander hands you each a piece of vellum stamped with a date and a number. ‘Receipts for the horses,’ he says, his tone noticeably more friendly.</p>
<p>You pocket the Receipt (mark this on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item that you keep in your pocket; owing to its size you need not discard another item in its favour if you already have your maximum number of items) and are about to walk away when he calls out, ‘Report to the citadel first thing in the morning. You’ll be allocated your battle positions for when the enemy attack.’</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="sect242.htm">Turn to 242</a>.</p>
