<h3>131</h3>

<p>The iron door to the tower is unlocked and you enter unopposed. At the top of the steep stone steps you find a ladder to a trapdoor. Quickly you climb the ladder and emerge onto the roof. ‘By the gods!’ exclaims Banedon, when you appear. ‘My prayers have been answered. You are alive, Lone Wolf. You are alive!’ Tears of joy fill his eyes as he welcomes your return warmly.</p>
<p>He and his mentor Chiban have been viewing the siege from this vantage point for the last three days. From this position they control the movement of the few reserves allocated to the north and west city walls, using them to fill in the gaps where the enemy’s attacks have weakened the defences. Banedon recounts how the siege has progressed; how twice the enemy has broken into the city and been repelled by the determined defenders. Attacks from the air have set the city ablaze, but the enemy has lost great numbers of their flying Kraan, and now they are too weak to dare use the few that remain. The Anarium was destroyed in the first few hours of the siege and many senators lost their lives, including Senator Chil and President Toltuda.</p>
<p>Then he asks of your quest and is overjoyed to hear of its success. ‘The gods smile on you, Lone Wolf. So long as you live there is hope for us all.’</p>
