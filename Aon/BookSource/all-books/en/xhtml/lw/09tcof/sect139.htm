<h3>139</h3>

<p>‘The lever that opens the exit panel is near the ceiling,’ whispers Sogh, casting nervous glances over his shoulder. He can hear the guards scratching at the wall behind, trying to locate the brick which opens the concealed entrance. Your fingers find the lever and you pull it. The panel slides aside and you both step out into an empty horse stall. As the panel slides back into position, you jam it with a piece of timber. Fortunately the stables are empty of guards and it is easy to make your escape through a side window that gives access to an alley.</p>
<p>‘Good luck, Northlander. I hope you find your friend. Remember, they have him locked up at the Eastgate Barracks,’ says Sogh. You bid him farewell, and as you watch him disappear into the shadows, you consider your best course of action.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to make your way to the Eastgate Barracks, <a href="sect23.htm">turn to 23</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to seek the help of Chiban the Magician, Banedon’s former teacher, <a href="sect221.htm">turn to 221</a>.</p>
