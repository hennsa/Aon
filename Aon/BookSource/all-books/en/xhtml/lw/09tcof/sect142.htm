<h3>142</h3>

<p>The courthouse of the Chief Magistrate is a grim, grey building. Devoid of any decoration or embellishment, its stark bare walls serve to remind the Tahouese of its sober purpose. It is a place where justice is meted out to wrongdoers. Harsh punishments are imposed: floggings and executions take place here every day of the week. All trials are conducted before a magistrate, and his decision is final as there are no juries in Tahou. The Chief Magistrate presides over crimes that are serious enough to warrant the death penalty, and your heart sinks when you learn that he is to sit in judgement of you.</p>
<p>You put up quite a struggle, but your shackles prevent you from breaking free of your armed escort. They drag you into the courtroom and throw you face down into an iron cage that stands before the Chief Magistrate’s chair. A bell is struck to signal the arrival of the Chief Magistrate and he enters the court surrounded by an entourage of scribes. The bell rings once more and the scribes say with one voice, ‘This hearing is now in session.’</p>
