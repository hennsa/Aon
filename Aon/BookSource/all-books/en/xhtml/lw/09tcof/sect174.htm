<h3>174</h3>

<p>The soldiers in the crowded hall look at you with awe and grudging respect. They pride themselves on their fighting ability, but none can match your swift and skilful disposal of the Deldenians. You step over the bodies and head towards the door, but, before you reach it, it slams open and a squad of guards from the South Gatehouse rushes in, summoned by the owner of the hall. They are all armed with crossbows, and they aim them at your chest. Resistance would be suicidal, and reluctantly you both raise your hands in surrender.</p>
<p>The guards escort you back to the South Gatehouse tower. Banedon, because he is a magician, is taken to another part of the city wall for interrogation, while you are imprisoned high in the tower itself.</p>
<p>Place an ‘x’ beside each of the Special Items, Backpack Items, and Weapons that are listed on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> to indicate that they are no longer in your possession. Only if you rediscover them at a later stage of your adventure may you erase each ‘x’ and reuse them.</p>
