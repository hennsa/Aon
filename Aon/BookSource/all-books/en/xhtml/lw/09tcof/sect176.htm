<h3>176</h3>

<p>‘Follow me!’ shouts Banedon, as he jumps his horse over the bodies of your slain attackers and gallops along the highway. He has survived the fight unscathed: by casting a magical net of sticky strands over a dozen rangers and their horses, he ensnared them all before they had a chance to level their lances at him.</p>
<p>The sergeant and the remnants of his company pursue you as you speed north along the highway. But you soon outdistance them, and the sergeant orders off the chase, returning to the standing stones to free his netted men.</p>
<p>Only when he and his men are beyond the horizon do you rein in your horses and slacken the pace.</p>
