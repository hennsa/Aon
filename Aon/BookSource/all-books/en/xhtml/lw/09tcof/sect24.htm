<h3>24</h3>

<p>You are unsheathing your weapon when you hear Banedon whisper, ‘Follow me.’ The rangers hear nothing, and as you drop the weapon their eyes follow it to the ground. At that instant, Banedon quickly recites the runes of a Brotherhood spell and a flood of sticky fibres gush from his outstretched hand. The sergeant and a dozen of his men are caught in a net of gluey strands that hold them and their horses rooted firmly to the ground. Banedon spurs his horse at the startled few that have escaped his spell, and you follow closely on his heels. A handful of rangers pursue you along the highway, but your mounts are much faster and they soon give up the chase and return to their helpless comrades.</p>
<p>Only when the rangers and the standing stones finally disappear from sight do you rein in your horses and slacken the pace.</p>
<p>Remember to erase one Weapon from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> before continuing your quest.</p>
