<h3>269</h3>

<p>When you have finished your meal, you talk at length about your journey from Dessi and your quest for the Lorestone of Tahou. Chiban produces a map of the city, which he unfurls on the floor of his study, the only surface not cluttered with magical equipment. With his toe he points to the location of the Tahou Cauldron: it is in the Square of the Dragons in the West District of the city.</p>
<p>‘The Cauldron is a funnel-shaped hollow with a circular shaft at its base. The shaft descends to the ruins of the ancient city of Zaaryx, 500 feet below the streets of Tahou. Legend tells us that the Lorestone was thrown into the Cauldron to prevent the Black Zakhan of Vassagonia from capturing it during the Great Khordaim War. The shaft was closed off and has remained sealed for the past 360 years.’ He looks up from the map and you notice that his smiling features are now sad and composed.</p>
<p>‘At dawn the armies of Darklord Gnaag will be at the gates of the city and the battle of Tahou will have begun. My duty is here, in the defence of my beloved city, otherwise I would willingly accompany you on our search. There is only one man who can help you now, for he is the only one that can grant you access to the shaft that descends to Zaaryx. He is President Toltuda of Anari. Come, I will arrange an audience with him immediately.’</p>
