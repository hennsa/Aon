<h3>339</h3>

<p>The father and the farmers are taking it in turns to ask each other riddles. In Anari it is forbidden to gamble for money on games of chance, but the wily Anarians get around the law by devious means. They gamble on being able to answer riddles correctly, which demands exercising skill rather than chance, and they wager goods, and sometimes their services, in place of money. By the time you join them the father and his sons have amassed quite an assortment of valuable items, and the plains farmers are clearly anxious to win back some of their lost possessions.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to join in and take an ‘Anarian gamble’, <a href="sect115.htm">turn to 115</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to take part in their game but would rather engage the tavern owner in conversation, <a href="sect268.htm">turn to 268</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would prefer to order a meal, <a href="sect88.htm">turn to 88</a>.</p>
