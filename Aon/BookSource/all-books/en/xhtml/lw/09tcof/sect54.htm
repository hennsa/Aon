<h3>54</h3>

<p>Arrogantly the sergeant-at-arms presents the case against you, but Chief Magistrate Gwynian is unimpressed with his account of your crimes. ‘Do you not know who it is that you have brought before this court?’ he asks. The sergeant looks puzzled, and a thin film of sweat breaks out on his reddening face as his confidence begins to crumble. After a long and embarrassing silence, he replies, ‘Er … no, sir.’</p>
<p>‘This is Lone Wolf, the last Kai Master of Sommerlund. Have you not heard of this man?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir,’ he replies, hoarsely, scarcely able to believe what he is hearing.</p>
<p>‘I order his possessions be restored to him forthwith, and all charges against him to be dropped.’</p>
<p>A bell is rung to signify the end of the hearing and the courtroom is cleared. You are released from the cage and ushered into the Chief Magistrate’s private chambers, where all your Weapons, Backpack Items, and Special Items are returned to you. (Remember to erase the ‘x’ marks from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
