<h3>74</h3>

<p>Shielding his eyes from the sun, Banedon surveys the horizon. After a few minutes he shakes his head. ‘No tracks or highway, nor even a sign of habitation for that matter. To get a better view we need to reach higher ground, but as there are no trees or hills in sight, I’ll have to improvise.’</p>
<p>And with that, he whispers the runes of a Brotherhood spell. Slowly he rises from the saddle until he is hovering in the air over twenty feet above your head. Then, having scoured the surrounding countryside, he descends slowly as the effects of his levitation spell begin to wear off.</p>
<p>‘There’s a river on the horizon,’ he says, slipping his feet back into the stirrups. ‘It’s probably the Churdas. Over to the right, about five miles away, there’s a small village on the river bank.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ride towards the river, <a href="sect40.htm">turn to 40</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to veer right and ride towards the village, <a href="sect111.htm">turn to 111</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to turn around and retrace your tracks to the junction, <a href="sect222.htm">turn to 222</a>.</p>
