<h3>105</h3>

<p>‘I come from King Sarnac,’ says the officer, his voice full of urgency. ‘I must find your Prince and request that he commit his reserves at once in support of our knights assaulting the bridge. Our spearmen are already engaged in a desperate attack at the orchard and the rest of our retainers have been used to support our cavalry advance on the right flank. We have but less than 100 men left to save our noblemen, who are being slaughtered at the bridge.’</p>
<p>You tell the officer where the Prince and his Palace Guard are fighting, of their victory, and of the desperate situation they now face. ‘I understand,’ says the officer, sadly. ‘I cannot expect the Prince to allow his reserves to be used when he needs them so urgently himself.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to return and take command of the Prince’s reserves, <a href="sect49.htm">turn to 49</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to help the Lencian officer gather reinforcements to support the knights at the bridge, <a href="sect148.htm">turn to 148</a>.</p>
