<h3>218</h3>

<p>The archers are playing a game they call ‘Bullseyes’, but you know it better by its Sommlending name of ‘Portholes’. Two diamond-shaped dice, each with ten sides numbered nought to nine are thrown by each player in turn. The numbers which appear face-up are added together (nought = zero), and the one with the greatest score wins. If anyone throws two noughts, however, they shout out ‘Bullseyes!’ and win automatically.</p>
<p>Each player must stake 12 Lune (3 Gold Crowns) per throw of the dice, and this money is bet before the dice are rolled.</p>
<p>Pick two numbers from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> for each of the other two players and note these scores in the margin of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. Now pick two numbers from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> for yourself. If your total is greater than the other players you win 24 Lune. If either of the other players beats your score, you lose your stake (12 Lune or 3 Gold Crowns).</p>
<p>You may leave the game at any time, but you must stop playing if you gamble away all your money and cannot place your stake.</p>
<p class="choice">When you decide to stop playing, you return to Prince Graygor’s tent; <a href="sect29.htm">turn to 29</a>.</p>
