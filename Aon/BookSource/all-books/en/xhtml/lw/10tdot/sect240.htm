<h3>240</h3>

<p>The first day of your voyage is smooth and uneventful. The strong current bears you steadily northwards and Jarel is content to allow the boat to drift with the flow while he enjoys the warm sunshine and your conversation. You learn much about your guide and the land of Eru, and in return you recount the legends of Sommerlund and tell of your adventures in the realms of Magnamund.</p>
<p>At dusk you reach a confluence where the river is joined by another that flows in from the east. Here the currents are swift and treacherous, but Jarel steers the boat masterfully and brings it ashore at a muddy beach on the west bank, where a small stone hut stands close to the river’s edge. You are dragging the boat up the muddy shore when Jarel suddenly freezes in his tracks. A movement among the tall grasses that fringe the beach has alerted him to a pair of green, pig-like eyes glinting in the gloom. ‘Keep still,’ he whispers, fearfully. ‘It could be a Gorodon.’ His fears are confirmed as the shadowy creature leaves its hiding place among the grasses and comes crawling down the beach towards you.</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, <a href="sect172.htm">turn to 172</a>.</p>
