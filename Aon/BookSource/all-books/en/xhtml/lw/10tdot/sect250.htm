<h3>250</h3>

<p>You run without pausing through the shadowy pines until you can no longer hear the cries of your pursuers. The forest is soon swallowed by the night but, guided by your Kai senses and the occasional rays of moonlight that filter through the densely packed trees, you are able to continue your lonely trek eastwards. You stop at a stream to bathe your face in the cold water and reflect on the bitter irony of your situation: the people you had hoped would help you now pursue you as their enemy. It is a cheerless situation but you do not allow it to defeat your resolve to reach Torgar and recover the stolen Lorestones.</p>
<p>Gradually, what begins as a suspicion becomes a nagging certainty that you are being watched. Your senses detect an evil presence lurking in the surrounding trees and you decide to forgo rest and keep moving until dawn. Tired and hungry after your ordeal, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
