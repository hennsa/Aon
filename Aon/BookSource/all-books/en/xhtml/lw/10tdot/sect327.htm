<h3>327</h3>

<p>You return to consciousness with a throbbing headache. A circle of bristle-bearded faces swim in and out of focus, staring down at you as if you were a fish in a bowl. You try to rise but are discouraged from doing so by the point of a sword that hovers above your heart. As your vision slowly clears you realize that you are no longer in the gorge, and the faces you see belong to a company of crimson-clad partisans.</p>
<p>‘It was careless of you to wander into Lacaress Gorge, Pathfinder,’ says a tall, lantern-jawed sergeant. ‘What were you hoping to find there save a good night’s sleep?’</p>
<p>‘I came with Prince Graygor’s leave,’ you say, showing your signet ring as proof. ‘I am here on a secret mission of great urgency. I must speak with your leader, Sebb Jarel.’</p>
<p>The sergeant inspects your ring carefully. ‘Very well,’ he says, and sheathes his sword. ‘We shall take you to Sebb, but you must agree to be blindfolded.’ You nod your assent and a yard of cloth is wound about your eyes. Guided by the sergeant, you are helped onto your horse and the reins given into the hands of one of his men. After two hours in the saddle, you reach your destination and the blindfold is removed.</p>
