<h3>61</h3>

<p>The Talestrians bring their horses to a halt and regard you with suspicion. Their officer draws his sword and demands to know your nationality and the name of your regiment. You reply in his native tongue that you are an Eruan Pathfinder, and a smile spreads slowly across his rugged face. He tells you that he and his men are scouts who have been sent to make sure that the hills are free of enemy troops. Your Kai Sixth Sense confirms that he speaks the truth, and when he offers to take you to meet his commander, you accept the invitation gladly.</p>
