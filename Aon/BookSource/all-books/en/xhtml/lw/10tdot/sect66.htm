<h3>66</h3>

<p>‘On to Cetza!’ shouts Prince Graygor. The battle-cry is taken up by his valiant soldiers as he leads them across the corpse-strewn field towards the town.</p>
<p>Heavy fighting is raging along the main street. The Lencian knights have taken the bridge and King Sarnac’s spearmen have breached the wall that surrounds the apple orchard. However, the Drakkarim are determined to stand their ground and they fight back viciously like starving wolves. You run with a group of longbowmen towards the centre of Cetza and find yourself approaching a barn-like building which overlooks the bridge. Standing at a window on its upper floor is a Drakkarim sniper with an arrow notched ready to fire. Patiently he watches you weaving through the smoky ruins until you present a clear target. He releases his straining bowstring and sends an arrow whistling towards your heart.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, add 3 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is 0–2, <a href="sect264.htm">turn to 264</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 3–5, <a href="sect121.htm">turn to 121</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 6 or more, <a href="sect319.htm">turn to 319</a>.</p>
