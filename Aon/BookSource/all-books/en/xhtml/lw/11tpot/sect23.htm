<h3>23</h3>

<p>‘I perceive much in your character that pleases me, human. You possess inner strength, honour, and a fiery courage uncommon among the mortals of Aon. Were it not for these traits I would have no hesitation in ridding myself of you, for I will not tolerate the weak and untrustworthy in my realm.’</p>
<p>He pauses for a moment and gazes fixedly at the shapes swirling near the centre of the room. ‘I have looked into your mind and the reasons why you are here in the Daziarn are now known to me. The quests and struggles of Magnamund are of no significance to the Shining City, but there are those of this world who would rejoice to learn that the last of the Kai is here, if only to seek you out and destroy you. For this reason you must leave Yanis. But I shall not send you away without guidance, for you have my respect and I shall help you all I can.’</p>
