  <p>You are Lone Wolf—the last Kai Master of Sommerlund. Tricked by your arch-enemy Darklord Gnaag, you have fallen into a portal of total darkness, a Shadow Gate, that leads to the twilight world of the Daziarn.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the supernatural void are the two remaining Lorestones you must find in order to restore the Kai to their former glory. Will you find them, or will you remain forever a prisoner of the void? Your doom or your destiny awaits you in this exciting penultimate episode of the Magnakai quest.</p>

 
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


      <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe’s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe’s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>
