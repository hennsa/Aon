<p>(<a href="sect230.htm" name="err230">230</a>) Addressing the issue of what <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> bonus the Dagger of Vashna or Helshezag should confer for this fight is rather problematic. On the one hand, use of the Dagger of Vashna in combat against Darklord Kraagenskûl adds ‘7 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of the fight, owing to the power of the Dagger of Vashna when used against a Darklord of Helgedad’ (cf. <a href="sect171.htm">Section 171</a>). Similarly, Helshezag will also add ‘7 points [to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>] when used against a Darklord of Helgedad’ (cf. <a href="sect240.htm">Section 240</a>).</p>
<p>However, things are complicated by the battle with Darklord Gnaag in a few sections where the text clearly states: ‘The power of the weapon you wield is greatly intensified when used within the walls of Helgedad. Owing to its increased power, add 12 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of the fight’ (cf. <a href="sect88.htm">Section 88</a>).</p>
<p>It seems that the author intended to keep the +12 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> bonus a surprise for the final, climactic battle, but this leads to inconsistency with the battle against Darklord Taktaal presented here.

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
