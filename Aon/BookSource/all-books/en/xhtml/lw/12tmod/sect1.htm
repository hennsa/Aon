<h3>1</h3>

<p>Upon entering the Shadow Gate you are submerged in total darkness and fall into a lightless void. Relentlessly you are buffeted and numbed by an intense coldness that drains the strength from your body and fills your mind with strange, dream-like images. It is as if you are being sucked into the heart of a swirling black abyss, and, as your senses fade, you pray that you have enough strength to survive your return to Magnamund.</p>
<p>Barely a flicker of consciousness remains when the sensation of warmth returns to your frozen limbs. It revives you and slowly you become aware of a fluorescent mist and a pinpoint of light in the far distance. The sensation of falling is replaced by a smooth forward movement, as if you are gliding to a halt at the end of a steep slide. Rapidly the tiny light grows larger until suddenly you emerge from the darkness and find yourself standing in a place that you recognize immediately.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> (if you pick a 0 it counts as 10). The number you have picked represents the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points you have lost during your passage through the Shadow Gate. Deduct this number of points from your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score.</p>
