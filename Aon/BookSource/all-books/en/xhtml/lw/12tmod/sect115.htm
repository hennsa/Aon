<h3>115</h3>

<p>The lookouts are naturally curious about the only passenger aboard their ship, especially as he keeps company with Guildmaster Banedon, the most highly respected magician in Sommerlund. They question you keenly about your mission to Durenor, but when you insist that you are sworn to secrecy, they pursue the matter no further—with you at least.</p>
<p>You learn that they hail from the Kirlundin Isles, a fiefdom famed for its brave and intrepid seafarers, whose ships have protected the coasts of Sommerlund for more than a thousand years. It shocks you deeply to learn that, during your exile in the Daziarn, the Darklords have destroyed the Kirlundin fleet and laid to waste the once fertile isles.</p>
<p>‘We’ll soon free our isles from that vile cur Gnaag,’ growls one disgruntled sailor. The others echo his sentiment, but behind their bravado you sense their fear that they may never live to see their islands free again.</p>
<p>A brooding silence descends on the deck and you decide it would be wise to get some rest before dawn breaks. One of the ship’s mates volunteers to show you to your quarters, and you accept his help gratefully.</p>
