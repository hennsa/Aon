<h3>197</h3>

<p>Fighting back your fear, you set off along the soot-encrusted street, keeping your head down and your shoulders forward to maintain your balance against the blasts of fiery wind that lash you mercilessly. At one corner, you happen upon a line of shallow pits, all filled with blazing oil. In the middle of each one is a pyramid of stone, festooned with chains, to which are manacled a dozen wretched creatures. They stand waist-deep in the flames, and, as they scream in pain, a group of Giaks amuse themselves by pushing them under with the hafts of their spears.</p>
<p>The Giaks are preoccupied with their cruel sport and you evade them easily. You continue along the street opposite the torture pits and arrive at a square flanked by four tall towers.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and have reached the rank of Archmaster, <a href="sect124.htm">turn to 124</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or have yet to attain this level of Magnakai training, <a href="sect283.htm">turn to 283</a>.</p>
