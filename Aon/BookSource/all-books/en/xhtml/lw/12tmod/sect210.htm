<h3>210</h3>

<p>Patiently, you watch the engineers complete their work. Then they climb down from the platform that services the tank area and leave the dry dock. When you are sure that the coast is clear, you climb the ladder to the tank and take a closer look at a control panel attached to its side. A dagger-sized length of white metal, suspended inside a thick glass tube, appears to control the power generated inside the orange tank. If you were to invert the tube, the change in position would be hard to detect but the result would be catastrophic. Once underway, the power would be allowed to build up unchecked and would eventually cause the tank to explode.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and have reached the Kai rank of Principalin or higher, <a href="sect31.htm">turn to 31</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or have yet to attain this level of Magnakai training, you can invert the tube: <a href="sect345.htm">turn to 345</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">Or you can leave the tube untouched and abandon your sabotage attempt: <a href="sect223.htm">turn to 223</a>.</p>
