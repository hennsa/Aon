<h3>217</h3>

<p>The Xargath sinks swiftly beneath the icy waters. Its tail breaks the surface and slaps the swirling foam, and then it too is gone, trailing the creature’s lifeless body as it spirals a hundred fathoms to its final resting place at the bottom of the Kaltersee.</p>
<p>An eerie silence descends upon the shattered decks of the <cite>Intrepid</cite> as the few who have survived the attack stare in horror at the swirling, bloodstained sea. Then begin the cries of the injured, and those who are still able to stand begin the grim task of recovering bodies and staunching wounds. You help with the search and find Captain Borse lying near the ship’s longboat. He is unconscious and badly injured: both his legs have been broken at the thigh by one swipe of the monster’s tail. You attempt to revive him with your basic Kai healing skills, but he is in deep shock and does not respond.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing, <a href="sect159.htm">turn to 159</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, <a href="sect41.htm">turn to 41</a>.</p>
