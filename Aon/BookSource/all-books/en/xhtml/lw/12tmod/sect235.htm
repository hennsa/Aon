<h3>235</h3>

<p>‘The Transfusor, which you must destroy to ensure the end of the Darklords who are now outside the boundaries of this realm, is located in the uppermost chamber of the Tower of the Damned. You will find this tower in a part of the city known as the Imperial Sector. But be warned! This sector is the most heavily guarded area of the city, for it is here that Gnaag himself resides.’</p>
<p>The Slavemaster takes a strange mask from a nearby table and offers it to you. It is made of a green, glass-like mineral and is shaped into a hideous visage. ‘Wear this always. It will keep safe your identity from any casual inspection.’ You accept the Green Mask (mark this as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>—you need not discard any other item in its favour if you already hold the maximum), and listen carefully as the Slavemaster concludes your briefing.</p>
