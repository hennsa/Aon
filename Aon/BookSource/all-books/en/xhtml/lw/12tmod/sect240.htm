<h3>240</h3>

<p>Your killing blow draws a howl from Darklord Kraagenskûl, so loud that it shakes the very foundations of the building. He falls, yet as he does so, his withered frame vanishes before your eyes, leaving only a tattered grey robe and a black sword to mark his passing.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep Helshezag, the sword of Darklord Kraagenskûl, mark it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. (You wrap this sword in the remains of the Darklord’s grey robe and carry it vertically, tied behind your Backpack.) When used in combat, it will add 5 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, and 7 points when used against a Darklord of Helgedad. However, prolonged use of this evil blade will weaken your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score. In the second and subsequent rounds of every combat in which you use the sword, you must reduce your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> level by 1 point. This reduction is permanent.<sup><a href="#sect240-1-foot" name="sect240-1">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Having recovered from your combat, you quickly leave the chamber by a stair that leads to the roof. There you discover the Zlanbeast, Kraagenskûl’s personal winged mount, perched on a raised log. Standing nearby is a Death Knight armed with a spear, staring absent-mindedly over the parapet at the harbour lights below. The Zlanbeast sniffs the air and shuffles along its perch with a nervous, rolling gait. It senses that you are its natural enemy and it is becoming agitated in your presence. You must act quickly and with skill if you are to use this beast to escape from Argazad.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a Bow and wish to use it, <a href="sect310.htm">turn to 310</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to approach the Death Knight and tell him that he is wanted at the barracks, <a href="sect92.htm">turn to 92</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to creep up on the warrior and launch a surprise attack, <a href="sect178.htm">turn to 178</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect240-1-foot" href="#sect240-1">8</a>] It is possible that your permanent <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score might fall to zero or below due to the evil power of Helshezag, but you may be wearing a piece of armour that gives you an <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point bonus. This would leave you with a permanent <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score of 0 with a current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score still above zero. If your basic <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score is reduced to zero or below, you are dead and your adventure is over.</p></div>
