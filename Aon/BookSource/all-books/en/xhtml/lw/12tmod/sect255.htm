<h3>255</h3>

<p>Kraagenskûl watches you step over the gore-stained bodies of his creations, and then raises his black sword as you approach him boldly. ‘Here lies your doom, fool!’ he roars, waving his sword before his ghastly face. ‘Come. Take it … if you dare!’</p>
<p>Cautiously you circle the Darklord, taking care to remain beyond the reach of his sorcerous blade, but he moves towards you with surprising speed. As you dive to avoid his attack, you seek a chance to turn the odds a little in your favour. With a mighty kick, you send one of the fiery pillars toppling towards your foe. He screams and dodges aside, but the column glances his shoulder as it slams to the granite floor with a crackling roar. The black sword spins from his hand and slides to a halt near the base of the throne. For a moment your eyes meet; then simultaneously you race to retrieve the blade.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. For every Magnakai Discipline that you possess, including your initial three skills, add 1 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0–5, <a href="sect90.htm">turn to 90</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 6 or more, <a href="sect133.htm">turn to 133</a>.</p>
