<h3>290</h3>

<p>The sergeant crashes lifelessly to the deck and, for a few moments, the troops that were fighting by his side stare down at his body in shocked disbelief. For six years he had led them to glory—his battle-skills and cunning ensuring their survival—and now he lies dead, killed by a Sommlending. Taking advantage of their stunned state, you cleave a path up the staircase and force your way towards the helm. You are within ten feet of the ship’s wheel when Davan screams a warning: ‘Archer above you!’</p>
<p>You glance up into the rigging and a cold spike of fear stabs your heart when you glimpse the gloating face of a Drakkarim marine. With one hand he holds a bow and with the other he draws back an arrow to his chin. He mouths a curse and lets fly the deadly shaft.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery add 2 to the number you have picked. If you have completed the Lore-circle of the Spirit, add 3 to the number.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0–3, <a href="sect122.htm">turn to 122</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4–7, <a href="sect53.htm">turn to 53</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 8 or more, <a href="sect321.htm">turn to 321</a>.</p>
