<h3>307</h3>

<p>The fatigue of your ordeal is dulling your senses and making it increasingly difficult to keep your eyes open; so, using your Backpack for a pillow, you settle down and slip readily into a deep sleep. However, it seems as though you have only just closed your eyes when a strange snickering sound stirs you to wakefulness.</p>
<p>Crouching at the entrance to the cave, and silhouetted by the flashes of storm lightning, is a hulking creature with yellow, cat-like eyes. It emits a hungry growl and leaps at your prone body, hoping to crush you beneath its huge bulk. But your reflexes thwart its aim—you roll aside and jump to your feet as it hits the ground, which shudders beneath the vast stone weight. Quickly the creature recovers and leaps once more, its hairy, lipless mouth opening in anticipation.</p>
<p class="combat">Egorgh: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 25   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 34</p>
<p>Owing to the speed of its attack you are unable to make use of a Bow. This creature is particularly susceptible to psychic attack; double all bonuses you would normally receive if using Mindblast or Psi-surge during the combat.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect153.htm">turn to 153</a>.</p>
