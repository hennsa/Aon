<h3>314</h3>

<p>The Death Knight sergeant has a reputation for cruelty that is matched only by his wanton greed. He is used to total obedience from his troops, and when you fail to answer his command he becomes suspicious. Arrogantly, he swaggers towards you and repeats his command, his hand reaching casually for a barbed whip which he carries holstered on his hip. It is too late to attempt an escape, but the fear of what may happen serves to sharpen your survival instincts. As you stare into his cruel eyes, you sense that all is not lost: he may let you pass if you offer him a large bribe.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess some Kika and wish to offer them as a bribe, <a href="sect202.htm">turn to 202</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess some Gold Crowns and wish to offer them as a bribe, <a href="sect126.htm">turn to 126</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Medal and wish to offer that as a bribe, <a href="sect269.htm">turn to 269</a>.</p>
