<h3>325</h3>

<p>The night wind is blowing in your favour and Captain Borse is keen to put to sea without delay. He has ordered the crew to run up every foot of canvas the masts of the <cite>Intrepid</cite> will bear, so that she will approach the Darklord warships that blockade the coast at full speed. With luck, she will slip through their line before they have a chance to close formation. It is a bold plan, but the captain and his crew have run the blockade more than a dozen times in the past year and they are confident that tonight they will also be successful.</p>
<p>Guided by the stars and the distant glimmer of the moonlit shore, the <cite>Intrepid</cite> makes rapid headway through the waters of the Toran Gulf. As it nears the open sea, you decide to offer your services as a lookout and go in search of Captain Borse. You find him on the forecastle deck with a group of keen-eyed Kirlundin marines, who are scanning the blackness for some sign of the enemy.</p>
