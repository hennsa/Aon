<h3>53</h3>

<p>You raise your arm and lash out at the speeding shaft, hoping to turn it aside on the edge of your weapon, but it ricochets towards you, gouging a furrow of skin and hair from your scalp: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. The archer fires again, but this time you manage to twist aside, and the arrow thuds harmlessly into the deck. He curses and bares his teeth as he reaches for yet another arrow. But before he can fire again, his aim is spoiled by two of his comrades, who rush forwards to hack at you with axe and sword. Davan protects your back, holding off the marines who are attempting to climb the stairs. You evade the first blows of your enemies, sidestepping a lunge and ducking wild swipe, and then strike back with deadly speed and unerring accuracy. Both scream and fall simultaneously, dying with a look of surprise fixed on their cruel faces.</p>
