<h3>111</h3>

<p>You focus upon the three distant pits and allow your consciousness to pass into the trance-like state that must be achieved to allow your Discipline to work. A tingling sensation runs along your limbs and gradually an image takes form in your mind.</p>
<p>From out of a swirling mist there comes into focus a moving scene that is terrible to behold. A vast procession of partially-clad soldiers are being herded into the pits by packs of blood-hungry Vazhag. They are bound with ropes and many are grievously wounded. They plead for mercy but their pitiful cries go unheeded as the snarling, savage rat-men stab them to death with their cruelly-fashioned spears before casting them down into the three yawning abysses.</p>
<p>Gradually the image fades and, as you return to consciousness, you discover that you are lying face down upon the ground. Your limbs shake uncontrollably and your forehead and chest are bathed in a cold sweat. You have tapped into the powerful residue of psychic force that pervades this site and the experience has left you in a state of psychic shock: lose 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
