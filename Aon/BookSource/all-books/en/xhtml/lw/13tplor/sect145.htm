<h3>145</h3>

<p>You are within a few feet of the gap when the first of the Vazhag’s arrows come screaming towards your legs. You twist aside and avoid one of the shafts, but the other hits you in the left leg and gouges a furrow of flesh from your calf: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Gritting your teeth against the sharp pain, you drag yourself through the narrow opening and emerge on a mountainside, at a place hidden beneath an outcrop which is ringed by wind-worn boulders and scrub. Early morning sunlight illuminates the surrounding hills, and beyond them you see a vast expanse of forest, a sea of sickly grey-green trees, which radiates an unmistakable aura of evil. The position of the sun and your Pathsmanship skills tell you that you are now looking upon the Forest of Ruel from the eastern foothills of the Skardos Mountains.</p>
<p>The land appears deserted, the only unusual feature being a wide dirt track which wends its way eastward through the hills towards a gap at the edge of the grim forest. You consult your <a href="map.htm">map</a> and conclude that this must be the Skardos Trail, the secret route used by the Ceners, which leads all the way to Mogaruith itself. You resolve to follow the trail, but first you hobble away from the ledge lest the Vazhag, and their monstrous war-dogs, should decide to give chase.</p>
