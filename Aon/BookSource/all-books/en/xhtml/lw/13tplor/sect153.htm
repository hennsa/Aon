<h3>153</h3>

<p>You hide yourself as best you can, taking advantage of a brace of boulders that lie beside the stone steps, and wait with bated breath as the sound of the approaching group grows louder and nearer. Torchlight flickers, casting a watery yellow beam across the cavern floor; then the first of the group enters and you catch sight of their repulsive forms.</p>
<p>A patrol of six Vazhag files into the cavern. Each one is as tall as a Sommlending youth and all are armed with crude, rusty weapons. Fragments of armour and uniforms, which once belonged to human soldiers, encase their hairy, rat-like bodies. They are more than ten feet from your hiding place, but even so, they give off such a vile aroma of filth and disease that you are forced to draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to prevent yourself from retching out loud.</p>
<p>They come closer and halt at the foot of the stone stairs, barely an arm’s length from where you are hiding, and you hear them talking in a high-pitched squeal which reminds you of rusty door hinges. All the while they repeatedly cast furtive glances at the west tunnel entrance as if they are waiting for another of their party to catch up.</p>
<p>Within minutes another member of their patrol does arrive, only this creature is not one of their breed: it is human-sized. However, the hooded scarlet robe it is wearing makes it difficult for you to be absolutely sure that the creature within is human. The Vazhag cease their squealing when the hooded one raises a gloved hand. In that instant, you catch a glimpse of the glassy green mask which is covering his face, and at once you recognize this mask: it is a <i xml:lang="x-cenerese">jazak</i>, the ritual mask of a Cener Druid.</p>
