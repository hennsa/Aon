<h3>16</h3>

<p>The passage descends steeply and the foul air becomes thick with a gritty dust which clogs your eyes and nostrils. Although the pitch blackness does not hamper your vision, the air has become so saturated with dust that you now have difficulty seeing more than a few feet in front of your outstretched hands. Slowly you advance, trusting to your Magnakai skills to protect you from choking as you seek a clearer section of the passage.</p>
<p>After a while you notice long streamers of greasy yellow moss hanging from cracks in the tunnel roof. Between them are spread festering fungi of varying hues, all cankerous and vile to the eye. You are passing beneath these growths when suddenly, as if triggered by a silent command, they burst open and shower you with great clouds of sticky, mote-like spores.</p>
<p>At once your body senses that the spores are highly poisonous and, as a subconscious reflex, your Magnakai Curing skills activate and counter the deadly toxins that have found their way into your lungs. Your chest is wracked with pain but you sustain no serious injury: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>The sticky, foul-smelling spore cloud is so thick that you have difficulty moving forwards. It feels as if you are wading through a tunnel of mud. Your Kai skills have neutralized the poisonous spores, but there is now hardly any air left to breathe. Fear wells up in your stomach as you feel your strength beginning to ebb.</p>
