<h3>164</h3>

<p>Despite his close proximity, and his powerful sense of tracking, the druid fails to detect your presence here in the cavern. You hear him mumble a few disgruntled comments and then, with all the enthusiasm of a tired sloth, he leads his snickering group of rat-men into the south tunnel.</p>
<p>Patiently you wait for their flickering torches to be swallowed up by its dark depths. When you are surrounded by total darkness once more, you leave your hiding place and hurry away along the west tunnel. For more than five miles you follow this winding route and, despite your mounting fears, you encounter nothing more threatening than a few ragged-winged bats and a frightened rock snake. Gradually, as the tunnel delves deeper into the Skardos Range, the air becomes increasingly cooler and more humid. You can smell the strong scent of water somewhere in the distance and you are not at all surprised when, as you round a sharp bend in the tunnel, you see faint shimmering reflections playing upon the rough stone ceiling.</p>
