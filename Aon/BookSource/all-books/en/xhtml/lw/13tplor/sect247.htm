<h3>247</h3>

<p>The two figures look down at their ghastly handiwork and shake their heads in dismay. As you watch, the sloat shudders beneath its bonds and becomes abruptly still. One of the robed figures stoops to inspect the creature’s exposed heart; then you hear him whisper words of disappointment that, yet again, their experiment has failed.</p>
<p>They wipe their bloodied hands on their robes before leaving the laboratory, locking the door behind them. Sensing that you are now alone, you take the opportunity to search the laboratory, including seven of its eight smaller anterooms, but you find nothing that remotely resembles the cultivation of a plague virus. The eighth anteroom, the door to which is bolted and barred, is the only area of the laboratory you have not investigated.</p>
<p>Although the main door is now locked, during your search you have discovered one other exit.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to leave the laboratory by this door, <a href="sect333.htm">turn to 333</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to investigate the eighth anteroom, <a href="sect131.htm">turn to 131</a>.</p>
