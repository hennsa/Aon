<h3>260</h3>

<p>Banedon issues the order to his dwarven crew to set a course for Palmyrion. Then, as the hum of the craft’s powerful engine rises in pitch, he ushers you into his cabin where a welcoming meal awaits. Effortlessly the <cite>Skyrider</cite> ascends into the moonless sky and speeds southwards across Sommerlund’s forested heartland, while you endeavour to enjoy your friend’s good food and company and try not to dwell too much on the daunting task that lies ahead. Together you reminisce about past times spent aboard the <cite>Skyrider</cite>, and recall the adventures you shared in the far-away lands of Anari and Vassagonia.</p>
<p>A few hours later, as your airborne voyage is nearing completion, the conversation turns to the quest in hand. Banedon tells you that you are bound for the Palmyrion city of Holona where your guide, Captain Cearmaine, is patiently awaiting your arrival. At once you recognize the name; you recall having heard tell of the captain’s feats of bravery during the Darklands War where his actions won more than a single battle and earned him commendations from more than a dozen Freeland nations. Lord Rimoah has served you well, for in all of central Magnamund you could not have wished for a better guide than Cearmaine.</p>
<p>It is an hour after midnight when the <cite>Skyrider</cite> passes over the glimmering waters of the River Reloni and descends towards the flat-roofed Canatarium, the largest of Holona’s eight municipal halls. There you are greeted by the Captain, a man whose proud face bears the scars of his many battles. He offers his hand in friendship and you are mildly shocked when your fingers close around a palm crafted of cold steel.</p>
<p>‘A keepsake from the Battle of Vellino,’ he says, raising his metal hand so that you may inspect it in the light of the <cite>Skyrider</cite>’s bow lanterns. ‘Alas, the first was stole away by a Drakkar’s axe.’</p>
<p>Captain Cearmaine is eager to leave Holona before sunrise. His carriage awaits to take you south to his command at Stonewatch, a military fortification which stands within sight of the Forest of Ruel. Before you leave, Banedon wishes you success and godspeed. He and his crew will be awaiting you here in Holona in readiness to return you to Sommerlund once the quest has been accomplished. You bid your old friend a fond farewell then settle yourself down into the plush comfort of the captain’s carriage.</p>
<p>For four hours you are lost in dreamless slumber as the carriage wends its way across a hundred miles of open grassland trail. When next you open your eyes it is to the sight of a grey dawn breaking over the Palmyrion Plain, and the sound of a sentry’s war-horn announcing your arrival at Stonewatch. A company of horsemen, each clad like the captain in ring-mail armour and a flowing chequered tunic of crimson and blue, emerge from the outpost and ride forward to meet the carriage. The captain acknowledges their salute and watches with pride as faultlessly they change formation to escort the carriage through the outpost’s stout wooden gate. Beyond lies a drill square that, even at this early hour, resounds to the shouts of command and the measured stamp of soldiers’ feet. You disembark near a watchtower and swiftly the captain ushers you inside and leads you to his quarters on the uppermost level.</p>
<p>You spend the day in his company and together you discuss your approach to Mogaruith while you wait for night to fall. After careful study of his maps, the captain proposes two possible routes by which you can reach the Cenerese stronghold. The most direct way is to enter the Forest of Ruel and journey due east. This is by far the shortest way, but it could also prove to be the most perilous. You recall Rimoah’s account of what lurks in this dread forest and the memory alone is enough to send a shiver coursing down your spine. The alternative is to journey southwards into the Skardos Mountains and enter one of the many subterranean passages that pass through that range. If you can find your way to the Skardos trail, the secret route by which the Cenerese enter and leave their realm, you should be able to follow it all the way to Mogaruith. Consult the <a href="map.htm">map</a> before making your decision.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to approach Mogaruith via the Forest of Ruel, <a href="sect228.htm">turn to 228</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to make your approach via the Skardos Mountains, <a href="sect309.htm">turn to 309</a>.</p>
