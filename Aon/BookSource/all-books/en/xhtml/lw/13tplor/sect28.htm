<h3>28</h3>

<p>Feeling unsettled by your close encounter with the deadly acid-spitting tunnel crabs, you unsheathe your weapon and descend the staircase with renewed caution. Sixty steps later you arrive at a small cavern where three tunnels converge, from the north, the south, and the west.</p>
<p>There are many tracks on the dusty floor and your Magnakai hunting skills enable you to read them with ease. They are confined to the west and south tunnels and, judging by their size and depth, they were made by large rat-like creatures, but ones that walk upright, like humans. From what you have been told about the denizens of Ruel, you are sure that these tracks were made by Vazhag, the warrior vermin bred by the Cenerese.</p>
<p>Among their tracks you note others that are far from rat-like. You are about to examine these a little closer when suddenly you hear the sounds of movement echoing from the west tunnel; a group of creatures are approaching. At once you abandon your tracking and look around for somewhere to hide.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take cover in the north tunnel, <a href="sect35.htm">turn to 35</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take cover in the south tunnel, <a href="sect201.htm">turn to 201</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to hide in the cavern itself, <a href="sect153.htm">turn to 153</a>.</p>
