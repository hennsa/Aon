<h3>318</h3>

<p>Drawing upon all of your Kai skills for aid and protection, you raise the hood of your cloak and emerge from your hiding place. The columns of armoured rat-men seem to pay little attention to you as you march boldly along the trail towards their mighty stronghold. Your skills of camouflage are working well; you can only pray that they will sustain you when you reach the archway itself.</p>
<p>Walking across the age-blackened drawbridge towards the spiky arched tower of Mogaruith is an unnerving experience. It is as if you are walking along a blackened tongue towards the gaping maw of some gigantic dragon. On either side the bubbling moat releases foul fumes which fill your nostrils with a terrible sugary stench that clogs your lungs and blurs your vision. You draw upon your skills and your vision clears, but the sight which lies ahead looks no more inviting than it did before.</p>
<p>At the tower you are challenged by a troop of Vazhag guards who regard you with suspicion and demand to know your purpose here. They will not let you pass until you answer.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to tell them that you are one of Arch Druid Cadak’s agents and that you have vital information for his ears only, <a href="sect268.htm">turn to 268</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Discipline of Animal Mastery and wish to use it, <a href="sect151.htm">turn to 151</a>.</p>
