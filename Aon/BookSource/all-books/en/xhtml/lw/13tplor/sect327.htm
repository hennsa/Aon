<h3>327</h3>

<p>As you sever the last of the flailing tendrils, the roaring above is replaced by a deathly silence. For a moment you remain where you stand, gasping for breath, the blood pounding in your ears. Your Kai tunic is soaked with the ichor of your unseen attacker and its rising stench is making it difficult to draw breath. Then you hear the sound of snapping branches and quickly you move aside as the body of the beast comes crashing down to earth.</p>
<p>With weapon poised you approach the huge shape. It resembles a bear, but covered in leaves rather than fur, and it possesses a bulbous head with four hooded orange eyes. Its bloated black and yellow striped body is a mass of severed stumps, and from the back of its neck there protrudes a clump of spines, like those of a porcupine, but these ooze a sticky black venom.</p>
<p>The sight and smell of this unnatural creature makes you linger no longer than necessary once your curiosity has been satisfied. Quickly you sheathe your weapon and press on towards the east.</p>
