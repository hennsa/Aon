<h3>92</h3>

<p>Determined not to be defeated by a closed door, you kneel down in front of the keyhole and attempt to pick the lock. It takes you just a few seconds to defeat it, but upon the very instant you do so, the spell which shields the mechanism discharges a powerful bolt of energy.</p>
<p>The bolt runs along the length of your arm and explodes in your head with a blinding flash—lose 5 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Your psychic defences lessen the damage you sustain, damage that would have killed a lesser man, but the unexpected shock still causes you to scream involuntarily.</p>
<p>The door is no longer locked and you hurry through it, keen to make up for lost time. However, your scream did not go unheard and as you rush into the hall which lies beyond the door, you are confronted by a creature freshly awoken by your cry of pain.</p>
