<h3>113</h3>

<p>You have only just re-entered the chamber when a second bolt slams into the arch of the tunnel. The blast and concussion throws you off-balance and, together with Banedon, you crash headlong to the floor: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>The fall revives Banedon and, although he is still far too weak to speak or walk, he manages to open his eyes and communicate with you telepathically.</p>
<p><i>I know this chamber … </i> he says, <i>… I have been here before. Look there, at the statue opposite. You’ll find a lever concealed at its side. It opens a hidden door. Hurry … </i></p>
<p>Guided by Banedon’s messages you discover that there is indeed a lever as he described. You pull it and a panel in the stone wall glides open to reveal a secret alcove and a flight of steps leading down. The sound of running feet warns you that the enemy are approaching along both passages, and so, without hesitation, you shoulder your friend once more and hurry into the alcove to avoid them.</p>
