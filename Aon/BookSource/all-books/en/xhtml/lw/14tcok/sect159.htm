<h3>159</h3>

<p>With deadly accuracy, you draw an Arrow and let fire at the crawling Drakkarim guard. At such short range the shaft penetrates his iron backplate, killing him instantly.</p>
<p>Quickly you descend the iron stairs and drag his limp body out of sight, fearful that it may be seen by a passing patrol. As you are moving him, you notice that he has two chains around his neck. To one there is attached a Whistle; to the other a Brass Key. (If you would like to keep either of these Backpack Items, mark your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied that the body is well hidden, you climb the stairs and carefully push open the heavy door. At the end of a short corridor there is a landing where a gallery overlooks the cavernous lower level. Nearby there is a staircase, leading downwards, and to your right a black oak door set flush to the wall.</p>
<p>Slowly you approach the gallery’s railed parapet and peer down at an unnerving sight.</p>
