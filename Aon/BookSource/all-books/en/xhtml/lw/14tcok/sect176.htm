<h3>176</h3>

<p>You give the door a mighty kick, slamming it open to reveal a creature clad in a hooded orange robe, kneeling in prayer before a black stone altar where a golden statuette stands on a square of faded cloth. It is flanked on either side by candles which give off a sickly bitter odour. The creature half-turns and shrieks in horror when it sees you rushing into the room. In desperation it raises its warty fists, but it is a futile defence against a blow which cleaves both its hands, and its head, from its loathsome body.</p>
<p>Sheathing your weapon, you step over the corpse and examine the creature’s remains. You recognize it to be a Ligan, one of those who aid the Nadziranim sorcerers in their evil craft. The statuette is a likeness of Slûtar, a Darklord who once ruled Kaag, and the orange robes mark this creature as one of his minions. It would seem that he still worshipped his master’s memory.</p>
<p>A foul, misty vapour arises from the corpse, forcing you to cover your nose and mouth and retreat from the chamber. As you pass in front of the altar, your eye is drawn to the gleaming golden statuette.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep this Statuette of Slûtar, mark it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. If you already carry the maximum number of items allowed, you will have to discard one in its favour.</p>
