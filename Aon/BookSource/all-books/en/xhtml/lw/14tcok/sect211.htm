<h3>211</h3>

<p>You unsheathe the sun-sword and hold it before you. Immediately, the twin streams of fiery bolts are drawn to its golden blade. They hit the tip and merge into a searing hot ball of power which radiates a blinding white light. The Sommerswerd vibrates in your hands. Desperately you fight to control the power that is held precariously in your grasp.</p>
<p>‘For Sommerlund!’ you cry and, with a mighty effort, you cast the ball of energy at the two dragon-creatures. The meteor of light hits the leading creature and explodes with a brilliant flash. There a splash of white-hot sparks and suddenly the tunnel is silent. The dragon-creature and the ball of fire have vanished.</p>
<p>For several seconds you stare at the remaining creature without either of you moving. Then, as prompted into action by a silent command, the two of you are galvanized into action. A flaming sword appears in the dragon’s paw and, with stunning suddenness, it leaps forwards into the attack.</p>
<p class="combat">Nadziran (in dragon guise, with flame-sword): <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 46   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 40</p>
<p>This creature possesses strong psychic ability. Unless you possess the Discipline of Kai-screen, deduct 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points every round you are in combat due to its relentless psychic assault.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
