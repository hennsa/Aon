<h3>264</h3>

<p>You step back from the dead war-dog and wipe away the splashes of its foul blood from your face. The sound of footfalls outside the door warns you that the noise of the fight has attracted some unwanted attention. A Drakkar shouts, demanding to know who is in the room. You rush to the door and pull across the bolt just in time to prevent him getting in. With the warrior pounding on the door, you turn and run into the adjoining chamber which is littered with Giak bones and half-chewed haunches of meat. To your right you notice another curtained archway, and through its threadbare cloth you see a stone staircase spiralling down into the dark.</p>
<p>The dingy stone staircase leads down to an empty torchlit chamber, its floor strewn with filthy straw. To the right there is a stout wooden door secured by a rusty bolt, and ahead you see a damp passage. Your Magnakai senses tell you that it heads due south.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take a closer look at the door, <a href="sect242.htm">turn to 242</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the passage, <a href="sect343.htm">turn to 343</a>.</p>
