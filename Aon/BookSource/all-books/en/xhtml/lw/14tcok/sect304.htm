<h3>304</h3>

<p>Fifty yards on, the passage turns sharply to the left and you find yourself staring at an iron-banded door. Luckily this portal is unlocked and you hurry through it, pausing only for a few seconds to bolt it shut behind you before continuing on your way.</p>
<p>Shortly you arrive at a deserted stairwell where you begin a long and laborious ascent. You climb more than sixty levels of the citadel before reaching the top. During your climb, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Directly opposite the landing at the top of the stairs is a massive bronze portal, its surface inlaid with intricate symbols cast in silver and gleaming gold. A sleeping Drakkarim sentry is seated beside this huge door. He snores softly, his leather-helmeted head tilted to his shoulder and his spear lying uselessly at his feet. He is oblivious to your presence as you glide past him and silently push open the great door.</p>
<p>Beyond the portal lies a massive circular hall, its walls lined with slabs of smooth black rock. Its domed ceiling rises more than a hundred feet to point directly above a dais positioned at the centre of the chamber. A flame-filled moat surrounds this circular platform whereupon lies the unconscious body of a blond-haired man clad in silken blue robes. Your spirits soar when you recognize the designs embroidered upon the robe for they are the symbols of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star—the Magicians’ Guild of Sommerlund. For a moment your joy at having found your friend is dampened when your Magnakai senses warn that great danger is close at hand. Prompted by this presentiment you hurry towards the moat, to where an iron drawbridge stands raised, and begin to crank its handle in order to lower it across the fiery divide.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Discipline of Kai-alchemy and wish to use it, <a href="sect18.htm">turn to 18</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Telegnosis and wish to use it, <a href="sect274.htm">turn to 274</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess neither of these Grand Master Disciplines or choose not to use them, <a href="sect146.htm">turn to 146</a>.</p>
