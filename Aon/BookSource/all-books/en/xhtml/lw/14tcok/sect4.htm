<h3>4</h3>

<p>You run into a passageway and follow it towards a distant intersection, but as you near the end of this narrow thoroughfare, a figure clad in red robes, accompanied by three Giaks, suddenly appears from the right and blocks your path. At once you recognize the robed creature: it is a Vordak, an undead spawn of the Darklords. The instant it sees you it attempts to cut you down with a bolt of psychic energy, but your innate Magnakai defences negate this attack. Shocked by your immunity to its power, the Vordak scans your mind and instantly discovers your true identity. With a shriek of abject horror the creature turns and flees, leaving its Giak escort stunned and bewildered by its behaviour. Then, too, their nerve breaks and they scurry after their lieutenant as fast as their bowed legs will carry them.</p>
<p>Anxious to prevent them from escaping and raising the alarm, you chase them towards a junction at the end of the street. When they reach the junction they split up; the Vordak turns to the left, while the three Giaks head off to the right.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to pursue the Vordak, <a href="sect118.htm">turn to 118</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to pursue the Giaks, <a href="sect189.htm">turn to 189</a>.</p>
