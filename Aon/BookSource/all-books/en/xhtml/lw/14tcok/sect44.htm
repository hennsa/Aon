<h3>44</h3>

<p>You hurry along the corridor, down the steps, and along the alley to the street. When the coast is clear you cross the street and follow a passage which takes you further southwards, towards the centre of this hellish metropolis. Everywhere there is decay and dereliction. Once-grand buildings lie in ruins and every surface is beslimed with nameless refuse. Soon you happen upon a concourse littered with more than a dozen Giak dead. Their posture, and the nature of their wounds, tell of a savage street battle fought here within the last few hours. Perched on nearby rooftops are a flock of vulture-like birds, cawing delightedly, their bellies distended by a surfeit of Giak meat.</p>
<p>The distant clang and clash of steel tell you that the fighting is not over; it has simply moved on. The noise prompts you to crouch in a darkened doorway for cover whilst you consider your next course of action. From this position you survey the street and notice a narrow stairway, directly opposite, which leads down to a crypt door. You focus on the dark portal and sense at once that it is open and unguarded.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to cross the street and investigate the crypt, <a href="sect228.htm">turn to 228</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to ignore the crypt, <a href="sect303.htm">turn to 303</a>.</p>
