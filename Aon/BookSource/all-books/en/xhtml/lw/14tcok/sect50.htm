<h3>50</h3>

<p>The moment you strike your killing blow, the body of the Ice Dragon becomes transparent, as if it was made wholly of glass; then slowly this form melts away to a steamy vapour which quickly evaporates, leaving no trace of the creature’s existence.</p>
<p>A deathly silence fills the hall, broken only by the sound of Banedon’s laboured breathing. Fearful of his condition, you climb the ivory staircase and rush to his side. However, you are prevented from touching your friend by the encircling wall of energy in which he is held prisoner. You sense that the power which keeps him here against his will is being generated by the crystal sphere which hangs suspended in the air directly above him. You gaze at this sphere and the thought occurs that if you could disrupt it in some way, by breaking or dislodging it, it might cause the power wall to fail.</p>

<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian, <a href="sect69.htm">turn to 69</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Magi-magic and have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian, <a href="sect108.htm">turn to 108</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to use a Bow, do not have any of the above skills, or have yet to reach the required Kai rank, <a href="sect338.htm">turn instead to 338</a>.</p>
