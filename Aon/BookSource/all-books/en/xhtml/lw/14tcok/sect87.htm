<h3>87</h3>

<p>The flames lessen and, as the heat subsides, you lower your cloak and stare with trepidation at the sealed archway.</p>
<p><i>He who does not serve … </i> booms the voice, menacingly, <i>shall not live.</i></p>
<p>With a startling abruptness, there is a loud <i>crack</i>. Chunks of mortar fall from the octopoid mosaic above the archway and, to your mounting horror, you watch as the eyes of the creature begin to glow with a baleful green light.</p>
<p>Like a waking goliath, the mosaic comes slowly to life. Mesmerized by its pulsating gaze, you barely step back in time to save yourself when its tile-encrusted tentacles burst from the wall and come writhing towards your head. You lash out at the flailing limbs but your blow glances off the armour-like skin, inflicting no more than a scratch upon the tiled hide of this supernatural creature. The tentacles move apart briefly to reveal once more the two glowing green orbs. Then a wave of psychic energy buffets your mind, designed to weaken and subdue you, but your Magnakai defences deflect this attack. You sense that the creature is surprised by your natural resistance and, before it can muster its powers to launch a second, far stronger psychic blast, you leap forward and aim a blow between its evil green eyes. You are within an arm’s length of striking the creature’s bulbous head when suddenly it squirts a stream of clear liquid from its beak aimed directly at your face.</p>
