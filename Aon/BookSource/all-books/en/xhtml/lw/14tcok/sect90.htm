<h3>90</h3>

<p>Using your Kai Mastery, you focus upon one of the five feeding Kraan, the only one which is equipped with a saddle and reins. The other four abandon their feast and take to the air as you approach, but the target of your attention remains on the roof, cowed and submissive to your psychic command.</p>
<p>You approach this scaly beast confidently and climb into its saddle. Obediently it obeys when, with a kick of your heels, you urge it skywards. Its powerful wings bear you speedily towards the landing platforms situated high above the great north door and, as you fly closer to your destination, you see two which are open and unguarded. One has an arch-shaped portal, the other a wider, oblong-shaped entrance.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to land at the platform with the arch-shaped portal, <a href="sect121.htm">turn to 121</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to land upon the platform with the oblong-shaped entrance, <a href="sect282.htm">turn to 282</a>.</p>
