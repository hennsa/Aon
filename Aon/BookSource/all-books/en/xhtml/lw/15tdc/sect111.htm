<h3>111</h3>

<p>You release your drawstring and send the Arrow screaming towards the creature’s hairless skull. Almost immediately it strikes the beast above its right eye and, although it does not penetrate bone, the shock of the impact knocks the Ciquali off its webbed feet and sends it tumbling backwards into the water.</p>
<p>You shoulder your Bow and rush to help Prarg who is lying, barely conscious, with his face in the shallow water which is sloshing around at the bottom of the boat. You are reaching down to pull him over onto his back when suddenly you feel two pairs of scaly hands grab hold of your cloak. With a loud growl, you spin around and unsheathe your weapon in readiness to deal with your attackers.</p>
<p>They are two Ciquali, their hides decorated with ritual scars which mark them as warriors of their tribe. At first they back away, shocked by the speed of your reflexes, but rapidly their nerve returns and, half-crouched, they glare at you with their hideous, bulging eyes. Their throat sacs swell and collapse with increasing rapidity as they approach the moment to strike; then, with a shrill screech, they raise their claw-tipped hands and leap simultaneously towards your chest.</p>
