<h3>160</h3>

<p>In order to delay the other Drakkarim, you bundle the bodies of the Death Knights down the stairs, but one soldier clambers across them and attempts to skewer you upon the tip of his spear. You sidestep his thrust and fell him with a lightning blow to the head, but not before his weapon gashes your side: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Hurriedly you cross to a window at the far side of the tower. Outside, directly below, you see a Drakkarim lancer sitting astride a warhorse. His lance is sheathed in a tube-like scabbard fixed to the rear of his saddle and in his hand he holds aloft a heavy cavalry sabre. He is cheering those who are entering the tower and he is completely unaware that you are only a few yards away.</p>
<p>Swiftly you climb onto the window ledge, raise your weapon, and then leap onto the unwary lancer below.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 3 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 5 or less, <a href="sect153.htm">turn to 153</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 6 or more, <a href="sect28.htm">turn to 28</a>.</p>
