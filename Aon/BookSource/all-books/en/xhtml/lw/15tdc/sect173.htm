<h3>173</h3>

<p>Aided by your Kai skills, you uncover some tracks frozen beneath the snow. They were made by horses and wagons and are a little over a week old. There are far more than you expected to find here, and you can tell at once that they were not all made by Magnaarn’s entourage. Before he left this site and headed west, he was joined by several hundred reinforcements.</p>
<p>During your search you also discover some scraps of food which you eat immediately: restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Having satisfied your curiosity, and your rumbling stomach, you decide to leave the campsite and follow the tracks westward.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Animal Mastery <em>and</em> have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian (or higher), <a href="sect227.htm">turn to 227</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this Discipline, or if you have yet to reach this level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect131.htm">turn to 131</a>.</p>
