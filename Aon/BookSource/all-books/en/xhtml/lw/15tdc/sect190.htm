<h3>190</h3>

<p>You draw upon your psychic strength to create, in the depths of your mind, three radiant pulses of pure energy. As you watch the advancing Gorodon, rapidly these glowing cores increase in size and power until they resemble a cluster of fiery meteors. The Gorodons increase their speed and come pounding through the shallows, their eyes blazing and their horns lowered in eager readiness to impale you on their razor-sharp tips. They are almost upon you when, with a blink of your eyes, you hurl your psychic pulses directly into their brains. The effect is instantaneous and devastating. It is as if all three have been felled simultaneously by a massive hammer blow to the skull.<sup><a href="#sect190-1-foot" name="sect190-1">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The Gorodons’ forelegs buckle and they are brought down head-first into the muddy shallows. Their horns sink deeply into the silt whilst their heavy torsos are thrown forwards by the momentum of their charge. For a few seconds they cartwheel end-over-end; then, with a chilling abruptness, they cease moving and settle into the mud. Your psychic attack was devastating but it did not kill them outright; it was the massive strain placed upon their necks when they fell that ultimately sealed their doom.</p>
