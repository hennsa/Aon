<h3>227</h3>

<p>Having decided to follow Magnaarn’s tracks, you are now faced with the unwelcome prospect of a tiring foot-slog through the Tozaz Forest, unless, of course, you can find some other means of speeding your journey. Using your Kai Mastery, you scan the surrounding woodland and send out a silent call for help A few minutes pass, and then a wild dog appears. He is soon joined by a handful of other creatures: a young grey-skinned boar, two feral snow-cats, and an ape-like Rhudun. Unfortunately, none are large or sturdy enough to carry you any great distance.</p>
<p>Then, from out of the snow-laden undergrowth, bursts forth a wild stag. It is a magnificent animal, as large and as strong as any stallion. Subdued by your commands, it approaches and tilts its antlered head to allow you to climb upon its back. Obediently it responds as you steer it through the forest, heading westwards in the wake of Magnaarn’s troops.</p>
<p>Shortly after dusk you come to the banks of the River Shug, close by a small settlement of log huts which are grouped around a derelict ferry post. You dismount, and with a slap to its rump, you send the stag trotting back to its forest home. You watch him disappear towards the distant tree-line; then you turn back to the river and approach the huts on foot.</p>
