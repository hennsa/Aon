<h3>31</h3>

<p>Uncertainty haunts your thoughts as you race across the desolate no man’s land that lies between the inner and outer defences of Shugkona. Soon you catch sight of these outer defences. They comprise a line of man-sized wooden casks filled with earth, behind which there stands a squad of Drakkarim archers. Their bows are loaded and aimed, ready to fire.</p>
<p>Quickly you steer your horse away from the road and set off across rough, snowy ground towards a distant line of trenches. Fortunately, the defences at the northern perimeter are much weaker than elsewhere. The trenches are empty, the guards having left earlier to watch Prarg’s execution in the main square. However, the rough terrain soon takes its toll upon your already tired horse. He is near to exhaustion, and as you approach the trenches, you fear he is not strong enough to make the jump.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Animal Mastery, add 3 to the number you have picked. If you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian or higher, add 1.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 3 or less, <a href="sect246.htm">turn to 246</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4–7, <a href="sect87.htm">turn to 87</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 8 or higher, <a href="sect165.htm">turn to 165</a>.</p>
