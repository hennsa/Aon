<h3>315</h3>

<p>Through the open archway comes a Lencian soldier attired in the parade tunic and breeches of a Court Captain. He is unusually tall, but his most striking feature is his close-set eyes which are bright above his thin, hawk-like nose and bushy black moustache. At once you recognize this officer, for he is Captain Prarg. During the fighting at Cetza you and he led Prince Graygor’s reserves in a decisive action that helped save the Eruan Guards and turn the tide of the battle in your favour.<sup><a href="#sect315-1-foot" name="sect315-1">15</a></sup></p>
<p>‘Well met, Sire!’ he says, with a smile, ‘ ’Tis an honour to have been chosen to guide you on your noble quest.’</p>

<p>[<a name="sect315-1-foot" href="#sect315-1">15</a>] This description does not match the events described in <cite><a href="../../lw/10tdot/title.htm">The Dungeons of Torgar</a></cite>. If you had led the Prince’s reserves to help save the Eruan Palace Guard, you would not have met Captain Prarg (see <a href="../../lw/10tdot/sect284.htm">Section 284</a> and subsequent sections). What you did together with Prarg was gather scattered soldiers to help save the Lencian knights in their struggle at the bridge (see <a href="../../lw/10tdot/sect163.htm">Section 163</a>, <a href="../../lw/10tdot/sect148.htm">Section 148</a>, and subsequent sections).</p></div>
