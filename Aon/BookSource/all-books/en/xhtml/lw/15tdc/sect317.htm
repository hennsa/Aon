<h3>317</h3>

<p>You abandon the shelter of the bridge and work your way slowly along the ice-filled ditch to a point directly in front of the tower. Here you settle to observe the Drakkarim guards who are dutifully keeping watch over the eastern approaches to the town. All you can see of them is their brutal faces peering out of the horizontal slit which runs the full circumference of the tower. After a while, three of the four Drakkarim leave the tower by a staircase at the side. Only one remains, and you decide that now would be the best time to make your move, before the three return or before their replacements show up for duty.</p>
<p>Prarg insists that he go first; he has crossed here once before and he knows a safe way through. The ground looks clear but there are concealed pits out there just waiting to snare the careless or unwary. You nod your agreement and, as soon as the guard turns his face away from the observation slit, Prarg makes his run. Crouching low, he half-runs, half-scampers across the clearing, keeping low and zigzagging as he weaves a safe path through the pits. It takes him thirty seconds to reach the base of the tower; then he slips around the side and takes cover beneath the steps before beckoning you to follow.</p>
<p>You take a deep breath then launch yourself out into the open. With heart pounding you run towards the tower, following in Prarg’s footsteps which are clearly visible in the snow. You are halfway across when suddenly the guard’s face reappears at the observation slit. You pray your camouflage skills will keep you hidden for a few seconds longer, but then you see something that shakes your confidence. The guard raises a curious square of glass in front of his eyes, and at once you sense it possesses magical properties.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have Grand Huntmastery and you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian or higher, add 1 to the number you have chosen. If you have the Discipline of Assimilance, add 2.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 0–3, <a href="sect249.htm">turn to 249</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4–6, <a href="sect67.htm">turn to 67</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 7 or higher, <a href="sect74.htm">turn to 74</a>.</p>
