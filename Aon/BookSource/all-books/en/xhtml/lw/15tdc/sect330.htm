<h3>330</h3>

<p>Breathless from the fight, you step away from the slain beast and wipe its foul blood from your weapon before sheathing it in your belt. A distant howl echoes along the tunnel, a chilling cry that warns you that the creature you have just defeated was not the only one of its kind.</p>
<p>Fearful of staying a moment longer, you turn around and hurry along the tunnel. Before long you find yourself in a section of this underground labyrinth which has suffered greatly during the recent rockfalls. Many fissures have opened up the stone floor and shattered the walls, but you take these obstacles in your stride and soon arrive at a ruined staircase which ascends to a landing. Here you are confronted by the corpse of a Drakkarim guard. It is slumped beside a mound of rubble which is blocking the stairs to the next level above. A quick examination of the dead body reveals that both arms are broken. Injured and trapped here by the rockfall, it appears that this guard eventually died of thirst.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the body further, <a href="sect299.htm">turn to 299</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to clear away the rubble that is blocking the stairs, <a href="sect18.htm">turn to 18</a>.</p>
