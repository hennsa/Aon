<h3>341</h3>

<p>Shocked by the death of their leader, the few remaining enemy turn tail and flee across the open plain in panic, with the stinging cheers of their foes echoing in their ears.</p>
<p>Then the cheering is cut short when an ominous noise comes rolling across the plain from the city of Darke. It is a thunderous boom that shakes the very ground on which you stand. You look towards the city and see that the battle is growing ever fiercer. But now there is a new and sinister aspect. Flickerings of magical fire can be seen dancing along battlements, engulfing friend and foe alike. You sense that it is the work of Magnaarn; he and his Nadziranim allies are responsible for this.</p>
<p>Then, through the smoke of battle, you see a Lencian flag flying proudly amidst the carnage that is taking place on the coastal plain, to the south of the city. Here, King Sarnac’s crusaders have turned an enemy flank and are storming its weakened centre. Maquin and Schera see the flag and, encouraged by their own victory, they decide to march at once in support of the crusaders’ brave attack.</p>
<p>You wish them both good fortune, for you know the time has come to part company with these brave men. Their destiny awaits them on the field of battle; yours will be found inside the city of Darke itself where, if you are to fulfil your quest, you must confront Warlord Magnaarn. You bid them farewell and watch as they lead their men in a marching column along the river road towards the field of battle. When they are a mile distant, you set off alone across the plain towards the hamlet, which lies <i xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to the gates of Darke.</p>
