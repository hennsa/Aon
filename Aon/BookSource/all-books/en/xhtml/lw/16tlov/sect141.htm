<h3>141</h3>

<p>Suddenly, a sparkling sheet of energy shimmers beneath the great arch, and you catch sight of a huge, booted foot stepping through it. You tremble at the thought of what will happen next, for you recognize only too well to whom the foot belongs. With mounting horror you watch as the Demoness Shamath emerges from the Shadow Gate in her entirety. Here on Magnamund she is five times greater in size and power than in her own domain, and she is hungry to exercise that terrible power.</p>
<p>She stoops down and plucks the Deathstaff from you as if she was removing a tiny splinter of wood from a lowly insect. Then she points a tree-sized finger at the ground before the dais and a huge hole appears.</p>
<p>A raging whirlwind arises from this abyss, a whirling vortex which quickly builds in power until it is sucking everything into its spinning black core. Screaming acolytes tumble past and disappear into its maw as you desperately hang on to the dais to stop yourself from being sucked to your death. But your resistance is futile. With a callous flick of her wrist, the Demoness Shamath consigns you to your doom.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your quest end here.</p>
