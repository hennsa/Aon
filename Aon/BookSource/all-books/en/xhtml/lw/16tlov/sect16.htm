<h3>16</h3>

<p>You flick your heel against Bracer’s flank and urge him towards the dingy street. Here, only a few houses show any light, and this through the knotholes and cracks of their bolted shutters. At length you come to a junction illuminated by a solitary street lantern. You are trying to decide which way to turn when your eye is distracted by something moving in the shadows. From out of a darkened doorway steps a pale-skinned woman wrapped in a black velvet cloak, edged with scarlet silk.</p>
<p>‘ ’Tis no night to be out ridin’,’ she says, her voice syrupy and seductive, ‘not ’less you be lookin’ for company.’</p>
<p>You tell her you have no need for her company and turn your horse to leave, but suddenly you find yourself transfixed by the woman’s eyes and unable to move. They seem unnaturally vibrant, as if filled with a flickering green fire; she is using magic in an attempt to charm you. Instinctively, you draw on your innate psychic Kai powers to try to dispel the charm, but her magic is unusually strong.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-screen, <a href="sect346.htm">turn to 346</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, <a href="sect290.htm">turn to 290</a>.</p>
