<h3>173</h3>

<p>The young woman smiles at you and begins to laugh.</p>
<p>‘You can’t harm me, Lone Wolf,’ she says, full of confidence. ‘You may as well sheathe that weapon for now, though you’ll be needing it later, I fancy.’</p>
<p>‘Who are you? What do you want?’ you hiss, still clutching your weapon defensively. ‘Are you some cursed illusion, some mind-trick of Naar’s sent to entrap me? Well, demon, maybe this will wipe the smile off your face.’</p>
<p>You strike the young woman a savage blow to the head but to no effect. She laughs again and says, with a mocking tone, ‘Now do you believe me?’</p>
<p>You back away, looking to either side for a way of escaping this creature, but there is none. She advances, and you regard her with fearful caution. She is wearing a worn leather jerkin and ragged trousers which are cut short at the knees, and does not appear to be armed with a weapon.</p>
<p>‘You should be more respectful,’ she says. ‘After all, if I should decide to leave, who’ll keep you hidden from the gaze of Shamath?’ She points to the giant Demoness to illustrate who she means. ‘Trinket or no,’ she continues, motioning to the Platinum Amulet you wear, ‘you wouldn’t last long against her without my help.’</p>
<p>‘What do you want from me?’ you reply, uneasily.</p>
<p>‘Your attention would be a good start. Strange as it may seem, I wish to help you, Lone Wolf.’</p>
