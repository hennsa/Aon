<h3>189</h3>

<p>‘Attend with care to what I say, mortal,’ says the face of Shamath. ‘When I have finished, I shall ask you this question: “While I am here to do Naar’s bidding, how many loyal servants guard my throne of power?” ’</p>
<p>Shamath notes the look of concentration on your face and she allows herself a sneering laugh at your expense before she continues. She is confident that you will not defeat her in this intellectual contest. She begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I possess two Dwellers of the Abyss. My loyal servants are equal in number to the months in a Magnamund year, less the number of my Dwellers of the Abyss.’</p>
<p>‘When the loyal servants and the Dwellers of the Abyss were counted together, their total number was doubled when my Lieutenants of Night arrived.’</p>
<p>‘But when my Lieutenants of Night arrived, the Dwellers of the Abyss had to leave.’</p>
<p>‘Exactly half of the remaining number also departed, for they were beholden to the Dwellers.’</p>
<p>‘From the remainder I picked the loyal servants to guard my throne of power. I chose them all, except for one who was known to me as a traitor. I executed the traitor before I set my loyal servants to guard my throne.’</p>
<p>‘So, mortal, answer my question: while I am here to do Naar’s bidding, how many loyal servants guard my throne of power?’</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="puzzle">Study the words of Shamath’s riddle carefully. When you think you have the answer, <a href="numbered.htm">turn to the entry</a> which bears the same number as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect189-1-foot" name="sect189-1">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you cannot answer Shamath’s riddle, <a href="sect216.htm">turn to 216</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect189-1-foot" href="#sect189-1">14</a>] It is safe to assume that a ‘Magnamund year’ has the same number of months in it as an Earth year. The section corresponding to the correct answer will have a footnote confirming that it is indeed correct. You have only one chance to guess at the correct answer.</p></div>
