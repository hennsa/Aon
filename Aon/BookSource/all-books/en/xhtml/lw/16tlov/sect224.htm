<h3>224</h3>

<p>You intensify your vision and focus upon the figure who commands the crystal dais. Shock freezes your spine when you recognize at once the face and flowing platinum hair of Arch Druid Cadak, ruler of Mogaruith, the usurper lord of Kaag. He has grown strong since your last fateful encounter, and now it seems that he is poised to fulfil the Dark God Naar’s lust for vengeance by releasing Vashna and his hordes from the depths of the Maakengorge.</p>
<p>You take your place among the throng kneeling before the dais, and hear Cadak’s voice ring out above the howling storm.</p>
<p>‘I summon forth from the Vortex of the Planes the Deliverer of Vashna, Mighty Lord of Darkness, Prince of the Legions of the Restless Dead. Come to us. Come to us now and fulfil our destiny. We, the worthy, now prove our faith in the undying power of Vashna.’</p>
<p>With these words, the acolytes utter a chilling cry of affirmation and rise to their feet. By rank they follow the Elders in single file towards a smaller, shimmering metallic arch which stands to one side of the crystal dais, almost obscured by the glare of the larger one. One by one they file through this archway, under the watchful gaze of Cadak, and then return to their places where they kneel and pray.</p>
<p>As you approach the smaller arch, you sense a curtain of power drawn across it. Anxiously you pray to the Gods Kai and Ishir to protect you as you prepare to pass through this invisible barrier.</p>
