<h3>234</h3>

<p>You remove the Amulet from your pocket and hand it to the old sage.</p>
<p>‘President Kadharian gave me this. It was found on the shore of Lake Vorndarol, near the ruins of Vorn, by a rogue who went by the name of Smudd. I tracked him to a tavern in Helgor but he was assassinated before he could tell me anything more about it. Can you?’</p>
<p>Gwynian holds the Amulet close to his myopic eyes and examines the engravings with great care.</p>
<p>After a short while he says, ‘It is a seal. It’s an amulet of fealty worn by the Acolytes of Vashna,’ he says sadly. ‘It would seem to confirm our fears. I have seen amulets such as this before, but none crafted from such a metal. This is a metal not of this world.’</p>
<p>Gwynian hands back the Amulet and you return it to your pocket.</p>
