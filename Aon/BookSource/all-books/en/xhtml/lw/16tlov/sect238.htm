<h3>238</h3>

<p>‘Who found this amulet?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘A rogue, one who goes by the name of Smudd,’ answers Kadharian. ‘A patrol found him in the mountains close by the River Storn a few days after the second troop went missing. When he couldn’t give a good reason for being there, they arrested him and brought him back to Helgor for <em>questioning</em>.’</p>
<p>Kadharian’s emphasis on the word ‘questioning’ leaves you in no doubt that Smudd’s interrogation probably involved some degree of torture.</p>
<p>‘Where is he now?’ you ask. ‘I’d like to, er, question him myself.’</p>
<p>‘He’s in Helgor. He stays at the Crooked Sage, an inn in the north quarter of the city. I’d willingly send a detachment of Palace Guards to fetch him here but that quarter of Helgor is rife with villains. Word would be sure to get out and he’d go to ground. My men would never find him. No, I’m afraid the only likely way you’ll get to speak to Smudd is by going to the Crooked Sage in person.’</p>
<p>‘Very well, President,’ you reply, ‘then that is exactly what I shall do.’</p>
