<h3>243</h3>

<p>You turn your head slightly and see a pair of sandalled feet standing on the deck by your side. They belong to the Elder whom you almost collided with when you jumped aboard the longboat. He repeats his command and this time, aided by your Kai Mastery, you understand what he says. He is commanding you to get up and go forward to the bow and help with the carrying of some wounded acolytes to the stern.</p>
<p>You nod to signify you acknowledge his order yet you do not raise your head—to do so would risk him seeing your face. Unfortunately, as you rise from the bench, your robe gets snagged on a splinter and is pulled up to reveal your boots and scabbard. The Elder becomes suspicious and he demands to know how you came to be in possession of these items.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Runic Disc, <a href="sect55.htm">turn to 55</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to say that you took them from a dead Vakovarian during the battle at the quay, <a href="sect82.htm">turn to 82</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to pretend that you did not hear him, <a href="sect22.htm">turn to 22</a>.</p>
