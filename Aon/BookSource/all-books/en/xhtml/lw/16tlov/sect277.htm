<h3>277</h3>

<p>Tearful with gratitude, the boy’s parents kiss your hands and thank you with all their hearts for saving their child’s life. The man asks if there is anything they can do to help you in return and you respond by asking who they are, and how they came to be hiding here.</p>
<p>You learn that they once lived in the hamlet of Vorn where the man, whose name is Bayan, made a humble but honest living fishing the waters of Lake Vorndarol. Then one fateful night, some weeks ago, the Acolytes of Vashna came and destroyed Vorn. They managed to escape with their lives but they fear that the rest of their community were slaughtered in the attack, or perished in the dreadful storms which followed. For the past few weeks they have been hiding in the hills to avoid the acolytes and the marauding bands of robbers who have come from Vakovar looking for loot.</p>
<p>You tell them that you have been sent here by President Kadharian to find out what is going on at Lake Vorndarol. Bayan replies that he knows a safe route through the hills which leads directly to the ruins of his old home. He says he is willing to act as your guide and you accept his offer gratefully.</p>
