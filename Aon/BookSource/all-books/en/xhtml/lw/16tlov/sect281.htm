<h3>281</h3>

<p>A one-eyed mongrel is standing in front of the inn, its head cocked defiantly at the first-floor window through which you are observing the Vakovarians.</p>
<p>Mentally you command it to cease its infernal yapping and it responds by running away along the street, whimpering pathetically, as if it has just seen a ghost.</p>
<p>Most of the bandit activity appears to be going on around the quay. In order to get a better view, you leave the inn and make your way down through the ruins towards the lake, taking care to avoid those Vakovarians who are out looting. The burnt-out shell of a meeting hall offers you an unobstructed view of the quay and its flagstoned square. You hide here, invisible among the charred roof timbers, and watch as a curious scene unfolds on the quayside.</p>
