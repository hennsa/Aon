<h3>291</h3>

<p>Like a fleeting shadow, you move through the undergrowth towards the brigand leader without making a sound. As you draw closer, you hear him cursing the incompetence of his men and you see him beating his clenched fist on the trunk of the fallen bough in frustration. Then you leap upon him, covering his mouth with one hand and locking his arm behind his back with the other. He growls and struggles like an angry bear to break free from your grip, but when you whisper a threat in his ear he quickly ceases to resist. Suddenly his nerve seems to break and he begins to whimper like a frightened puppy. You ease your hand away from his mouth just enough to allow him to speak and at once he pleads with you not to kill him. He offers you the contents of his satchel and free passage away from here if you will promise not to harm him.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to see what he has in his satchel, <a href="sect113.htm">turn to 113</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to question him about why he has laid an ambush for you, <a href="sect75.htm">turn to 75</a>.</p>
