<h3>323</h3>

<p>Smudd is clearly impressed by your generosity. He removes his hand from his sword and the scowl of fearful suspicion softens to a smile as he lowers himself back into his seat. With a flick of his hand he dismisses the bar-girl. She leaves without protest, and as you watch her walk away, he leans across the table and says, ‘How can I help you, stranger?’</p>
<p>‘What do you know about a little hamlet called Vorn?’ you say, quietly.</p>
<p>For an instant the look of suspicion returns to his beady eyes; then he sneers and says, ‘I know it no longer exists, that’s what I know. There’s a rumour on the street that it was destroyed by the storm, but there’s more to it than that. More than I care to remember.’</p>
<p>You show him the Black Amulet that President Kadharian gave to you and once more you repeat your question. Now he refuses to answer, fearing that you are one of Kadharian’s agents out to arrest him. He kicks back his chair and tries to stand, but he does not make it.</p>
<p>He is halfway out of his seat when suddenly his chest is transfixed by a crystal arrow. Wide-eyed with pain and shocked surprise, he crashes to the floor amid a spray of blood and spilt ale.</p>
