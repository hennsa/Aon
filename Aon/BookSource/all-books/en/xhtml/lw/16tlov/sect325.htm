<h3>325</h3>

<p>Suddenly a piercing note blares out above the din of battle: it is a war-horn and it is sounding the recall to the acolyte longboat. You see those Acolytes of Vashna who are fighting in the ruins suddenly break off their combat and race back to the quay in answer to this command. Their mission has been achieved. They have recaptured their three brothers and now the time has come for them to depart.</p>
<p>As you watch them streaming along the body-strewn quay, a bold plan springs to mind, a plan that could enable you quickly to discover the truth about what is happening at the Maakengorge. If you were to don a red robe from one of the acolytes you have slain, you could infiltrate the ranks of those acolytes who are now fleeing back to the longboat.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to put on a red robe and attempt to get aboard the acolyte longboat, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide that it is too dangerous a plan, you can watch the acolyte retreat from the safety of the ruins by <a href="sect275.htm">turning to 275</a>.</p>
