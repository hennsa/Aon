<h3>329</h3>

<p>The Vakovarians search the inn thoroughly. They fail to find you on their first sweep, but when they return to search again, one of them discovers your hiding place when he accidentally treads on your foot.</p>
<p>You react quickly and with fatal effect. A blow to the throat silences the brigand for good and prevents him from ever warning his confederates that you are here. They do not notice that he is missing and they leave the inn to go elsewhere. By the time they realize they are one man short, you have searched and hidden his body and made good your escape from the inn.</p>
<p>Among the items you discover on the brigand are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>Quiver with 4 Arrows</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Short Sword</li>
<li>13 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Rope</li>
<li>Small Sack</li>
</ul>
<p>After leaving the inn, you make your way down through the ruins towards the lake, taking care to avoid other Vakovarians who are out looting. The burnt-out shell of a meeting hall offers you an unobstructed view of the quay and its flagstoned square. You hide here, invisible among the charred roof timbers, and watch as a curious scene unfolds on the quayside.</p>
