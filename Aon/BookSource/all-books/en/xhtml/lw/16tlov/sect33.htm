<h3>33</h3>

<p>The alley is pitch dark but this causes you little difficulty. Using your Magnakai skill of Huntmastery, you can pick out the way ahead with ease. Your horse is not so gifted, but he trusts to your guiding hand to avoid the stinking debris and broken glass which lie strewn across the cobblestones. You are nearing a street at the alley’s end when you hear the <i>click</i> of a door latch. You halt, and from an archway to your left you see two men emerge. One is a wiry figure, partially bald; the other, a swarthy-faced villain with ragged ears and greasy blond hair. Daggers gleam dully in their hands as they advance towards you with murder in their eyes.</p>
<p>Silently you unsheathe your weapon. A few moments later, when you re-sheathe it, it is slick with the blood of these two footpads. A search of their pockets nets you six Gold Crowns and enough food for one Meal. (Remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p>Anxious to leave, you remount your horse and turn him to face the street at the end of the alley.</p>
