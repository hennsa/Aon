<h3>335</h3>

<p>Bayan says farewell to his wife, warning her to stay hidden here with the child until he returns. She thanks you once more for curing her son and she wishes you a safe journey; then Bayan leads you to another hovel where he has hidden a donkey. It is a stubborn, flea-bitten old ass, but it serves Bayan well as the two of you follow his secret trail into the foothills of the southern Durncrags.</p>
<p>It is a long and tortuous route but it is also a safe one. At dusk you come to a cave whose entrance is hidden by clumps of loose brushwood. Bayan and his family have used it several times over in the past few weeks and they have stocked it with a buried cache of roots and berries. These, together with some live game which you catch at a nearby stream, make for a filling and nutritious meal which you both enjoy before settling down to a long sleep.</p>
