<h3>341</h3>

<p>As soon as the stable boy has saddled Bracer, you mount up and leave the inn at a gallop. You decide to forgo sleep this night and begin your journey north without further delay. Shortly past midnight, you pass through Helgor’s ruined East Gate and head off along a rutted track that winds a northeasterly route towards the River Storn. The moon is full and this rough trail is illuminated clearly by its cold, ashen light. Far to the north an electrical storm is brewing. Flashes of forked lightning light up the horizon and the sky, and the hills echo to the rumble of distant thunder.</p>
<p>You have covered little more than ten miles when the trail gradually peters out. You continue on across soft heathland for a few miles further until you find another trail, muddier than the first. Fresh tracks are imprinted in its surface, leading off towards the northeast. Curious as to their origin, you dismount and take a closer look.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have Grand Huntmastery, add 1 for every Kai level you are above the rank of Kai Grand Guardian to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 4 or less, <a href="sect307.htm">turn to 307</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5 or more, <a href="sect256.htm">turn to 256</a>.</p>
