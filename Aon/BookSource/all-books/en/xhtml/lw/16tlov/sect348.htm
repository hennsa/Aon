<h3>348</h3>

<p>As the last of the Vakovarians falls dead at your feet, you step away from their heaped bodies and wipe the sweat of battle from your bloodied brow. You have slain the enemy but you can hear more of their kind stumbling across the boulders, eager to reach you and avenge the deaths of their brothers-in-arms.</p>
<p>You retreat into the copse, using your Magnakai skills of Invisibility to keep you hidden from the advancing brigands. In their clumsy eagerness to enter the trees, they fail to notice you slip through their lines and circle around behind them. You have outwitted them but you are still anxious that they may find your horse. You move to higher ground in order to get a better view of the copse and, from a vantage point among the boulders, you observe their leader and three of his henchmen hiding nearby, crouched behind the bough of a fallen tree.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Bow and wish to fire an Arrow at the Brigand leader, <a href="sect304.htm">turn to 304</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use the spell <i>Mind Charm</i>, <a href="sect212.htm">turn to 212</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to wait and observe these brigands a little longer, <a href="sect98.htm">turn to 98</a>.</p>
