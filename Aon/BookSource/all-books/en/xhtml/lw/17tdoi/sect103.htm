<h3>103</h3>

<p>The moment you destroy the last undead warrior, the agonizing current which holds you captive suddenly disappears. You stagger away from the door, cradling your blistered hand which trails alarming wisps of blue smoke. Gritting your teeth against the pain, you draw on your Kai healing skills to repair the damage to your fingers and arm.</p>
<p>When you have recovered sufficiently to go on, you return to the door to find that it is no longer closed. The lock has opened, although there is now no trace of the Onyx Key (erase this from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>You push open the door carefully and enter a chamber composed entirely of polished black crystal, where you see myriad images of yourself trailing away into infinity within the mirror-smooth walls. At first you see only your own reflections, but when you cast your gaze around this eerie chamber you realize that you are not alone. Standing guard at an open archway are a trio of undead creatures, the like of which you have never encountered before. They are armed with barbed tridents which they hold loosely in their corpse-green hands. Suddenly they become aware of your presence and come scurrying forwards, their tridents raised in readiness to pin you to the wall.</p>
