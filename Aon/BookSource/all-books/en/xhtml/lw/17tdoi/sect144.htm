<h3>144</h3>

<p>With trepidation you steer the ship along a string of narrow fjords which cut an uncertain route through this treacherous field of icebergs. Your hands, slick with nervous sweat, grip the wheel tightly and inch it back and forth in response to the pilot’s frantic signals. It is a gruelling ordeal which soon takes its toll on the nerves of all aboard.</p>
<p>Every few minutes your vision is obscured by gusts of powdery snow which swirl across the deck, blown down from the tops of the surrounding ice cliffs. One of these fierce blasts temporarily blinds you. As you fight to restore your vision, the incessant howl of the wind is suddenly accompanied by the tortured screech of the ship’s hull as it collides with a ridge of submerged ice. The impact sends the vessel careering violently to starboard and hurls you painfully against the wheelhouse wall: lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
