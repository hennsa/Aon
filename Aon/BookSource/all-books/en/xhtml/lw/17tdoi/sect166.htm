<h3>166</h3>

<p>Banedon reaches for a small wooden box which lies half-buried on a shelf, amongst a clutter of scrolls and charts. As he does so, he is momentarily distracted by the Platinum Amulet which you wear on a cord around your neck. You notice the suddenly inquisitive look in his eye.</p>
<p>‘How did you come by that?’ he asks, as he stares fixedly at the amulet.</p>
<p>‘It was given to me by Gwynian—the Sage of Varetta. I’m sure its powers kept me safe from the perils of the Maakengorge. Tell me, my friend, have you heard of this sage?’</p>
<p>‘Oh yes,’ replies Banedon, thoughtfully, ‘I know Gwynian. If the amulet you wear was given to you by him then, perhaps, you do not need the special protection I had in mind after all.’</p>
<p>Banedon takes the small wooden box and hands it to you. Upon opening it you discover it contains a platinum amulet, almost identical to the one you are already wearing.</p>
<p>‘I see what you mean,’ you say, as you close the lid and return the box to Banedon.</p>
