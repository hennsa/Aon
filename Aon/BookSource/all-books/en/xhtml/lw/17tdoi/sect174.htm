<h3>174</h3>

<p>The lock disintegrates and the door bursts open, spraying a shower of ice into the empty corridor beyond. Before leaving the cell you pause for a few moments to use your Magnakai skill of Nexus in an attempt to determine the location of your missing weapons and equipment. You sense they are distant. Guided by your feelings, you turn to the right and go off along the corridor in search of them.</p>
<p>The dingy, ice-caked corridor wends its way deeper into the bowels of this vast alien vessel. You explore a maze of empty holds, where the walls are braced with gleaming crystal girders, and pass through low-ceilinged chambers that, despite the biting chill, reek of death and decay. At length your search ends at a great grey door which is guarded by two undead Drakkarim warriors, armed with spears. The noises you heard earlier have now ceased, and so has the movement of the vessel. You sense that this craft is no longer at sea.</p>
<p>From the cover of a curving crystal bulkhead, you spy upon the Drakkarim guards while you consider your next move.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the guards with your bare hands, <a href="sect243.htm">turn to 243</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose instead to use your Magnakai mind Disciplines upon the guards, <a href="sect336.htm">turn to 336</a>.</p>
