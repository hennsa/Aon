<h3>185</h3>

<p>To your regret, the new wave of Lavas reaches the Demonlord before you and form a protective circle around his cream-coloured body. Those that remain in the sky beat the air with their mighty wings, causing a powerful down-draught which holds you at bay.</p>
<p>Shielding your eyes from the stinging dust-choked wind, you look up to see that one of the winged creatures is cradling a curious item in its horny hands, an item which radiates an intense aura of evil power. At first glance it resembles a large metal bowl with a sharp spear of crystal fixed to its underside, but when the Lavas descends towards Tagazin and inverts it, you suddenly realize its true purpose and design. It is a helm of power, affixed on top with a crystal spike. The Lavas places the helm upon the Demonlord’s head and the spike begins to glow menacingly.</p>
<p>Now all of the Lavas ascend into the sky where they wait to view a confrontation which is about to commence. Suddenly Tagazin, revitalized by the power of the spiked helm, comes charging at you with his head lowered, snorting gruffly like a raging bull.</p>
