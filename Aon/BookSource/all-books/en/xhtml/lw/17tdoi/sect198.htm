<h3>198</h3>

<p>Outside of this vessel is a vast subterranean lake enclosed within a titanic cavern of ice. Several ice-boats, similar to the one on which you set sail from Fort Azgad, are moored in a long line at the lake’s edge. Scores of undead warriors attend to these ships, and many more can be seen marching along the frosty walkways which go all around the lake’s shoreline.</p>
<p>Quickly you realize that these ships are part of a great invasion fleet. Constructed by the slaves of Deathlord Ixiataaga, they can only have been built for one purpose—to carry his armies of undead warriors to the lands of the living. Rimoah and Ardan were correct—the Deathlord does intend to wage a bloody war upon Magnamund—yet even their gloomiest predictions failed to estimate just how advanced his plans are.</p>
<p>Shocked by the revelation of your discovery, you reaffirm your vow to thwart the Deathlord’s monstrous scheme. You move away from the porthole and hurry along the hallway in search of a way out of this alien submarine.</p>
