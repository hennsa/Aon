<h3>262</h3>

<p>Your Kai Mastery warns you that the rod is ready to discharge another blast of energy. If you touch this sorcerous weapon, it is you who will be the victim of the blast.</p>
<p>Aware of the danger, you quickly pull your hand away. Instead of retrieving the rod, you change direction and barge your way head-first through the skeletal warriors who are blocking the door. The speed of your action leaves them sprawled helplessly on the ground and, by the time they have untangled themselves and staggered to their feet, you are nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>You escape along a dark corridor and, when you are sure that you are not being followed, you pause for a few moments to use your Magnakai skill of Nexus in an attempt to determine the location of your missing weapons and equipment. You sense they are not too distant and, guided by your intuition, you go off along an adjoining passageway in search of them.</p>
<p>The dingy, ice-caked tunnel wends its way deeper into the bowels of this vast alien vessel. You explore a series of empty holds, where the walls are braced with gleaming crystal girders, and pass through low-ceilinged chambers that, despite the biting chill, reek of death and decay. At length your search ends at a great grey door which is guarded by two undead Drakkarim warriors, armed with spears. The noises you heard during your time in the cell have now ceased, and so has the movement of the vessel; you sense that this craft is no longer at sea.</p>
<p>From the cover of a curving crystal bulkhead, you spy silently upon the Drakkarim guards while you consider your next move.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the guards with your bare hands, <a href="sect243.htm">turn to 243</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose instead to use your Magnakai mind Disciplines upon the guards, <a href="sect336.htm">turn to 336</a>.</p>
