<h3>278</h3>

<p>On reaching the stone roof, you notice an opening at its centre which is partially overgrown with barbed creepers. You rip away this foliage, taking care not to scratch yourself on the poisonous barbs, and discover a flight of steps, thick with slime, which descend into the dark interior of the sunken building.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your preoccupation with the stairway distracts you from an imminent danger. Suddenly your Kai senses alert you to the threat, and when you spin around, you find yourself facing a horde of monstrous shapes. Bloated corpse-things jostle with humanoid horrors and skeletal warriors whose bones are gnawed with decay. It is a ghastly sight—a regiment of Chaos-creatures, drawn here by the scent of human prey. You shiver with dread for clearly you are the prey they seek.</p>
<p>They have come streaming along the same mossy ridge that you travelled, hungrily following your scent trail. But now they are on the roof and, with frightening speed, they charge towards you. Gibbering and howling like demons, they hurl themselves upon you in a desperate attempt to slay you with fang and claw.</p>
