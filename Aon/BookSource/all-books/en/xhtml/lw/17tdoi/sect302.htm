<h3>302</h3>

<p>You quickly recover and take your position at the helm, yet the impact has left you shivering with shock. The crew have also been clearly terrified by the collision; most of them are cowering along the ship’s rail, staring up at the encroaching walls of ice, their eyes haunted with fear as they pray silently to the Goddess Ishir.</p>
<p>Then, almost without any warning, the snow-laden wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg field into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea. The crew give a hearty cheer, relieved that their icy ordeal has at last come to an end. One man pulls the cork from a bottle of black rum which he has been keeping for a special occasion. He takes a mighty swig, and then passes it to a comrade. Just as the second man is raising the bottle to his lips, unexpectedly you hear the pilot’s voice echoing along the deck: ‘Ship ahoy!’</p>
<p>Fear returns to tie a knot in your stomach as you turn and focus your eagle eyes upon the distant vessel.</p>
