<h3>311</h3>

<p>Squatting upon a plinth of stone arising from out of the floor is a huge, snarling, jackal-like creature which you recognize immediately. It is the Demonlord Tagazin, the supernatural beast which you encountered many years earlier during your quest to the dungeons of Torgar.</p>
<p>The unexpected sight of this creature, whom you fought, defeated, but did not destroy all those years ago, sends a shiver of dread coursing down your spine. Your Kai instincts tell you that Tagazin is slave to Ixiataaga—he is the Deathlord’s loyal companion.</p>
<p>Tagazin, too, recognizes you to be a former adversary. He recalls his ignominious defeat at your hand and, enraged by this bitter memory, he leaves the plinth and comes stalking towards you. Venom drips from his bared fangs and murder glows darkly from the depths of his nightmarish eyes.</p>
