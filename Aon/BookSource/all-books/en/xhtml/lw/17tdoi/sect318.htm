<h3>318</h3>

<p>In their frenzy to get at you, many of the Chaos Horde tumble headlong into the pit to be consumed by the creatures which lurk within its slime-filled base. Soon you have thinned their ranks sufficiently for you to be able to leap over the scuttling, severed remains, and make a swift escape up the steps to the surface.</p>
<p>Without looking back, you leave the stone roof and hurry away along the mossy ridge towards a thicket of mist-enshrouded trees. As you pass through this eerie wood, you detect the presence of Tagazin once more. Fresh tracks indicate his direction and determinedly you set off, finding it an easy task to follow his clawed footprints in the loamy soil. They lead you through a tangle of saw-toothed briar and up a gently sloping rise. As you crest the top of the rise, you look upon an awe-inspiring sight.</p>
