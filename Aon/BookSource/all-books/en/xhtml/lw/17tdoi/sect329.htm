<h3>329</h3>

<p>Lanza and his men reach the quayside, having fought their way stoically through the ranks of the Ixian undead. The Captain, his face streaked with sweat, shouts excitedly and waves his sword. The tide of the battle appears to have turned and he seems elated by his hard-won victory. But then you realize that he is not cheering—he is shouting a warning.</p>
<p>From the prow of the enemy ship comes a hissing cloud of fire-tipped arrows. You dive for cover and escape being hit, but many of the burning shafts pierce the ice-boat’s decking and start fires in the sails. The flames spread with unnatural speed and you are quickly engulfed by flames.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to escape from the burning ship by jumping into the harbour, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to reach the quayside by swinging from the rigging, <a href="sect201.htm">turn to 201</a>.</p>
