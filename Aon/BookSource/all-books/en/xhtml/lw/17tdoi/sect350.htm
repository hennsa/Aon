<h3>350</h3>

<p>Two days out from the Tozaz ice-field, you catch sight of Fort Azgad. After the ordeal of Ixia, the sight of this spartan little outpost is one of the most welcoming you have ever seen. The garrison salutes you as you bring your ship to the quayside where Lord Ardan, Captain Lanza, and Prarg are all waiting to welcome you back.</p>
<p>Warmly they congratulate you, praising your inspired act of courage and bravery but you sense that all is not well. The feeling of unease which haunted you upon leaving the ice-caverns of Ixia has returned.</p>
<p>‘Where’s Banedon?’ you ask of Lord Ardan. ‘Is something wrong?’</p>
<p>Ardan’s face grows as sombre as his reply. ‘King Ulnar sent word to Sarnac’s court, summoning the Guildmaster to return urgently to Sommerlund. It is grave news, I’m afraid, Grand Master. In your absence, your country has been attacked. The Dark God, Naar, has sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to destroy the Second Order of the Kai and lay waste to your homeland. It is said his new minions are confident of swift victory for they are sure you will never defeat the Deathlord of Ixia.’</p>
<p>‘I must leave for Sommerlund at once,’ you say, looking to the eastern horizon. ‘My brethren and my country need me.’</p>
<p>The others nod in silent agreement. ‘We will do all we can,’ replies Lord Ardan, ‘to speed your passage home.’</p>
<p>The news of your country’s plight comes as a terrible shock. In Ixia, you have won a great and lasting victory against the forces of Evil, but could the cost be too great? You fear, also, for the lives of your young Kai acolytes. The Second Order are worthy Kai warriors but they are young, their mettle yet to be tested in the furnace-heat of battle. You pray to Kai himself that they be strong enough to resist Naar’s newest champions, at least until you return.</p>
<p>The challenge of the long journey home and the quest to save the Second Order of the Kai from the deadly wrath of Naar’s newest champions awaits you in the next Grand Master adventure, entitled:</p>
