<h3>76</h3>

<p>Hurriedly you extricate yourself from the fighting and take cover in the doorway of a nearby hut. The heavy wooden door is hanging off its hinges, and you can tell from the number of sacks, barrels, and boxes that are stacked inside that this hut is a food store. Through a window on the far side of the hut, you see the Lencian ice-boat. A score of undead have clambered aboard the vessel and it is clear by their actions that they intend to destroy and sink it.</p>
<p>Determined to put a stop to their plan, you race into the hut, squeeze yourself through its solitary window, and then run headlong towards the stricken ship. You are halfway along the gangplank when you find yourself confronted by a wedge of skeletal warriors, each armed with a crude axe or sword. You leap into their midst, striking them down with blurring speed and deadly accuracy. But, as the last one falls, its corpse-like body almost severed at the waist, you hear a noise behind you which makes you spin around in fearful expectation.</p>
