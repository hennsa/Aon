<h3>83</h3>

<p>King Sarnac dismisses his guardsmen before ushering you, Banedon, Lord Ardan, and Captain Prarg, into an adjoining antechamber. An oaken table commands the centre of this opulent room, upon which is spread a detailed map of northwestern Magnamund.</p>
<p>‘In response to Lord Ardan’s request, I have made provision for your journey to Ixia, Grand Master,’ says the King, as the five of you gather around the map table. ‘As we speak, a man-o’-war is standing by in Vadera harbour, awaiting my order to set sail. Captain Prarg will accompany you during the first part of your sea voyage to our outpost, which is here on Azgad Island.’ King Sarnac points to the map, indicating a remote island near to the Gulf of Konkor.</p>
<p>‘The garrison on Azgad Island is commanded by Captain Lanza. Word has been sent of your coming, and Lanza has a crew and an ice-boat ready to place at your disposal. They will transport you across the stormy Tozaz Sea and land you on the southern coast of Ixia. From there you must make your way on foot to the city of Xaagon, where you will find the Deathlord and his accursed weapon—the Deathstaff.’</p>
<p>You study the map and, with growing dismay, you appreciate the difficult voyage which lies ahead. ‘Very well, sire,’ you reply. ‘I understand how I am to <em>reach</em> Ixia in order to find and defeat the Deathlord, but can you tell me how I am to <em>return</em> once my mission has been accomplished?’</p>
