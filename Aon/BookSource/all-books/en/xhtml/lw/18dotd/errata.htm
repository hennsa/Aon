<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
