<h3>104</h3>

<p>The sun is now above the horizon and this hamlet is slowly stirring to life. You decide to wile away the next hour or so by looking around its simple shops and riverside stores. One building in particular catches your eye: it is a hall perched precariously on the end of a wide wooden jetty. You can hear an old man’s voice trailing from its open doors, answered by the occasional murmur of a crowd. Inside you discover a wizened old cleric administering to a sick woman whose head is swathed with bandages. The cleric is attempting to cure the woman of her ills by laying on his hands, but the pressure is simply making the pain in her head feel worse.</p>
<p>‘Charlatan,’ mumbles one onlooker. ‘Old fake,’ whispers another. The aged cleric hears these dissenting voices and he becomes flustered. Although he may be incompetent as a healer, you sense that he is a good man at heart and so you decide to save him from the disgruntled crowd, who look as if they are on the brink of throwing him in the river at any moment.</p>
<p>‘Hold, good brother!’ you say, moving swiftly through the crowd to the small stage on which he and the bandaged woman are standing. ‘You should not be placing your hands upon this good woman’s head. Surely the source of her pain stems from her aching heart!’</p>
<p>And with this you take hold of the man’s hands and place them on the woman’s chest. Her first reaction is one of shock and she starts to pull away, but when you transmit your own healing powers through the cleric’s hands and into her body, the pain in her head suddenly vanishes. A smile of pure joy lights up her face and hurriedly she strips off her bandages.</p>
<p>‘Ishir be praised!’ she cries. ‘I’m cured. I’m completely cured!’</p>
