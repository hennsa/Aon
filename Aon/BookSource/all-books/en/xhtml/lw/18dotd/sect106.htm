<h3>106</h3>

<p>The tip of the swirling vortex is drawn to the Platinum Amulet you wear around your neck, like lightning to a conductor, and upon the instant it touches there is a blinding flash. An electrifying jolt runs through your body and a deafening screech splits the air.</p>
<p>For a terrifying moment the amulet becomes red hot (lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points); then there is another flash, and the power of the ring rebounds from the amulet and returns towards its source. For an instant you glimpse the Prince’s face—it is a mask of abject terror. Then the vortex reaches him and, in a blink of an eye, he is swallowed up by a whirlwind of supernatural fire.</p>
<p>‘So perish all who serve the Dark God!’ you scream, elated by your unexpected victory over the evil Prince Lutha.</p>
<p>High above you can hear the distant sound of running feet. A troop of the Prince’s guards are rushing to his aid, although you sense that it is too late to save him now. Rather than stay to face their wrath when they discover their leader has been incinerated, you use the edge of the amulet to prise open the circular panel in the wall of the pit. As it falls away, you discover a chute which leads to an underground river. Quickly you crawl along this slime-smeared chute and slip into the cold waters, where you are carried swiftly away by the strong undercurrent.</p>
