<h3>148</h3>

<p>You recoil from the insidious green cloud and fall back towards the cell door. Your mastery of Nexus protects you from this highly poisonous gas, but the gaoler and Lord Nathor are not so fortunate: both are vulnerable to its deadly effect. Choking and retching, they collapse to the floor, their fingers scrabbling at their swelling throats as they fight desperately for breath. You grab hold of their tunics, one in each hand, and drag their bodies out of the cell into the cleaner air of the corridor beyond. Here you use your Magnakai Discipline of Curing to ease the effects of the poison gas; your skill and the swiftness of your actions save them from a painful, suffocating death.</p>
<p>‘Wh … what happened?’ wheezes Nathor, as he slowly recovers from the deadly gas.</p>
<p>You peer into the cell at the man now hanging limply in chains, and then you turn to Nathor and say: ‘Suicide. A suicide and an attempted murder. The prisoner has just killed himself with a poison pellet and it seems his last wish was to take all three of us with him.’</p>
