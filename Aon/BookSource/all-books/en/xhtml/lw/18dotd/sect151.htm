<h3>151</h3>

<p>You lead the regiment across the ford, keeping an eye peeled on the sky above in case the enemy should appear without warning from over the tree-line. But the danger to the regiment comes not from above; it is at ground level.</p>
<p>As you are leaving the ford and ascending the slope of the river bank, suddenly there is a tremendous explosion. Unwittingly, you have ridden your horse through an invisible beam, a beam which has triggered a device hidden earlier among the rocks by Naar’s minions. The explosion sends sharp splinters of rock tearing into horses and men with deadly effect. The blast knocks you from your saddle and, as you fall backwards into the cold water, a splinter of rock slices through your left arm and another tears open your upper left thigh: lose 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Gritting your teeth against the stinging pain you struggle to your feet and use your Kai healing skills to staunch the bleeding. As the dust of the explosion clears, you count two horses and two men lying dead in the water. Captain D’Val has lost his horse, but miraculously he has survived with no more than scratches to his face and legs. Quickly you attend to the wounded, using your healing skills to ease their suffering. D’Val, wary of the vulnerability of his regiment, orders his men to abandon the dead and cross the ford as quickly as they can.</p>
<p>Cursing your ill luck, you hurriedly remount and join him at the head of the column.</p>
