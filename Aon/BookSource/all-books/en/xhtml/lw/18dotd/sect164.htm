<h3>164</h3>

<p>You focus your advanced Kai healing powers on the young man’s wound and cause the punctured tissues to knit together (reduce your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score by 3 points). Your treatment deadens his pain and revives him, but you know that this remission is but temporary; the poison in his blood is too strong and too well-established to be neutralized by your Kai powers.</p>
<p>Through clenched teeth, he forces himself to speak. You hear him tell his father that Prince Lutha’s army is being aided by a sinister group of Cener Druids and renegade Nadziranim magicians. Lutha himself possesses a ring of power, which bestows upon him an invulnerability to weapons. The boy says this ring must be taken from him if he is to be slain.</p>
<p>Gradually, the effects of your healing powers wear off and the brave young man slips into a sleep from which he will not awaken.</p>
