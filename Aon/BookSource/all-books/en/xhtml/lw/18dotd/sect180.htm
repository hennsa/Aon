<h3>180</h3>

<p>With Sabre Fox at your side, you climb the circular stairs to the Grand Hall of the Tower of the Sun. Excitedly the young Kai Master announces your arrival to the battle-weary Kai who are gathered here, and, at first, they look at you in stunned disbelief. Then the truth of what they see sinks in and they give vent to a loud cheer that can be heard all throughout the monastery.</p>
<p>The news of your return spreads like wildfire. Two of the first to welcome you back are your friend Guildmaster Banedon, and your trusted advisor Lord Rimoah.</p>
<p>‘Thank Ishir you are alive, Banedon,’ you say clasping his hand in friendship. ‘In Holmgard they fear that you and Rimoah were killed aboard your skyship. It gladdens my heart to see this is not so.’</p>
<p>‘And it warms me to see you safely home, Grand Master,’ he replies.</p>
<p>‘Though we’ve been hard-pressed to keep your home safe in your absence,’ adds Lord Rimoah, with a wry smile.</p>
<p>‘You both have my deepest thanks,’ you reply. ‘You took a great risk in coming to the aid of the Kai. I have seen what became of your skyship, Banedon. You were indeed fortunate to have survived.’</p>
<p>‘Aye,’ he replies, sadly. ‘Yet, alas, three of my Brotherhood were not so blessed. They perished when the Lavas dragged us from the skies.’</p>
<p>‘Take heart, Banedon, for their deaths will not be in vain. They shall be avenged.’ And with these prophetic words you take the Sun-crystal from your pocket and show it to your grieving friend. ‘With this crystal I shall destroy the Shadow Gate and put an end to Naar’s evil plan.’</p>
<p>Together with Banedon and Rimoah, you make a tour of the monastery to assess for yourself the extent of the battle damage. Your presence among the young Kai greatly improves their morale and strengthens their resolve to withstand the Lavas’ siege. You visit every area of the monastery, including the Lore Hall of Solaris where the bodies of those slain in battle have been laid out, awaiting burial. It saddens you to see so many Kai dead and, as you walk among their still ranks, you recognize many in whom you had held high hopes: Spring Rain, Eastwind, Sharp Dove, Deep Heart, Frost Lark, and Firefly. As you turn to leave the Lore Hall, you vow to Banedon and Rimoah that the sacrifice they have made will never be forgotten.</p>
