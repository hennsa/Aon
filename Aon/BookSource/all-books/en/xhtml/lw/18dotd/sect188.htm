<h3>188</h3>

<p>The woman reaches to her purse and counts out 40 silver Lune into the cleric’s trembling hands, and all the while she praises him loudly for taking the pain from her head. The cleric, whose name is Matho, sheepishly accepts her generous donation. Then, quite suddenly, he is swamped by the crowd of onlookers who all rush the stage at once. Each one waves a money purse and demands that he cure them as well. The frail old man is in danger of being crushed to death until you rescue him from this agitated crowd.</p>
<p>Once safely outside, he offers you all of the woman’s donation, for he knows only too well that it was your healing abilities which cured her, and not his own. (If you wish to accept this money, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as 40 Lune, which has the equivalent value of 10 Gold Crowns. It takes up the same space in your Belt Pouch as would 10 Gold Crowns.)</p>
<p>‘Where are you bound for, stranger?’ he asks.</p>
<p>‘The east,’ you reply.</p>
<p>‘That’s where I’ve journeyed from. Perhaps I can offer you a word of caution, eh? There’s plague in the Stornlands this year. You would be well to avoid the region if you can. If you can’t, well, this potion will protect you. I can at least guarantee that.’</p>
<p>The old cleric pulls a small flask from his pocket and offers it to you. (If you wish to accept this potion, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as Matho’s Potion.)</p>
<p>Then the old cleric accompanies you back to the blacksmithy where he, too, is having his mount re-shoed. You collect your horse, and he collects his ragged old mule; then you bid each other good luck and farewell before going your separate ways.</p>
