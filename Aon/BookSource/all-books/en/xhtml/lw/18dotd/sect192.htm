<h3>192</h3>

<p>You draw an Arrow and take careful aim at one of the leading Lavas. As it dips its head and opens its jaw, you release your straining bowstring and send your shaft whistling towards its face. The fire-hardened tip penetrates its eye and, with a hideous shriek, it spins end over end before crashing into the parapet of the North Watch.</p>
<p>‘Fire at their eyes!’ you shout, and a cloud of fifty Kai arrows are sent screaming through the sky to seek their elusive mark. More than half find their target, decimating the first wave of the Lavas attack at a single stroke, yet those winged creatures who do survive this deadly volley are quickly among the defenders on the wall. Suddenly you are confronted by one of these beasts who attempts to bat you from the battlements with its horny tail. You leap to avoid its scything attack, draw your weapon in mid-air, and strike your first blow the moment your feet return to the flagstones of the North Watch.</p>
