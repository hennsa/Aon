<h3>197</h3>

<p>After a few minutes the druid ceases to sweep the river’s edge with his curious-looking device, and you watch him disappear below the parapet of the trench.</p>
<p>Rather than attempt to exit the water here, you allow the current to carry you a few hundred yards downstream. Here you discover a shallow bay in the river bank which affords you better cover from the nearest enemy trench. Quickly you crawl out of the water and slither like a snake up the muddy bank to drop silently into this trench. A dull-witted Eldenoran is swiftly dispatched with a blow from the edge of your hand, enabling you to move further along this log-walled ditch. Just as you are passing the opening to a makeshift dugout, you sense danger ahead. A single file of Eldenoran swordsmen is marching along the trench in your direction: it will only be a matter of seconds before they are close enough to see you.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to dive into the dugout to avoid being seen by these men, <a href="sect185.htm">turn to 185</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to unsheathe your weapon and prepare for combat with this advancing file of troops, <a href="sect57.htm">turn to 57</a>.</p>
