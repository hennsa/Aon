<h3>206</h3>

<p>The brigand leader mounts his horse, but before he can make good his escape, you take a running leap over the abbey wall and drag him out of the saddle. Together you crash to the frost-hardened ground and desperately he kicks and struggles to break free from your steely grip. Out of his boot he snatches a stiletto blade and thrusts it viciously at your throat. You dodge your head aside, avoiding its razor-sharp tip, but in doing so you let the brigand slip out of your hands. He rolls away and begins to rise to his feet, but then he freezes, his eyes wide with fearful recognition, as he stares at your face.</p>
<p>‘L … Lone Wolf!’ he gasps, mortified, as if he is confronting a ghost.</p>
<p>‘Drop the dagger and surrender!’ you order, levelling your weapon at his head to reinforce your command. Swiftly the brigand’s expression changes from one of shock to one of sneering defiance.</p>
<p>‘You’ll never take me alive!’ he spits, and to your shocked surprise he thrusts his dagger deep into his chest.</p>
