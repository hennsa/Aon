<h3>210</h3>

<p>The road which crosses the plains to the east of the river is deeply rutted. Fortunately, though, it is dry, there having been little rain in these parts for weeks. Progress is good and by midday you and your troop have covered more than thirty miles. You pass many wagons on this road, mostly driven by farmers who are taking their crops to the markets and wharves of Garthen. These wagon drivers seem an unusually loyal and friendly breed; invariably they wave and cheer the moment they recognize the uniforms of Queen Evaine’s Court Cavalry.</p>
<p>After a brief rest at a village on the road, you continue your ride across the open plains and descend into a wide valley where a shallow stream winds its way through a mass of reed-beds and willow copses. Beyond this valley, the land becomes increasingly hilly. The sun is almost touching the horizon when you come to a small wayside shrine dedicated to the Goddess Ishir. Here a track leads off to the north and, a mile distant, you can make out the walls and tall bell-tower of a chateau high in the hills.</p>
<p>‘That’s the monastery of the Vaderish Brethren,’ says Nathor. ‘They’re a holy order devoted to the worship of the Goddess Ishir. We will find safe shelter with them this night.’</p>
<p>The sun has set and dusk is quickly turning to darkness by the time the troop reaches the gates of the Vaderish Monastery. The brothers of this holy order are led by an elderly monk called Rasbarin whom Nathor has met once before. The old cleric welcomes him warmly, as if he was his son, and then he invites you to stay here overnight.</p>
<p>The monks’ evening meal is simple fare but well-prepared and wholesome nonetheless (restore any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points you may have lost during your adventure so far). Afterwards, Rasbarin invites you and Nathor to his chambers to sample some of the monks’ speciality—a fine liqueur called Aquas. You are raising a glass of this golden liquid to your lips when suddenly the peace is shattered by a loud, cawing shriek which echoes through the surrounding hills.</p>
