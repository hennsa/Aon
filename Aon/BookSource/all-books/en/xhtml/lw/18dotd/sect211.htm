<h3>211</h3>

<p>As you enter the courtyard, a boy rushes out of the stables and eagerly takes charge of Wildwind’s reins. He praises your horse enthusiastically and promises that he will look after him well while you are enjoying your visit to the tavern. On entering the taproom, you are welcomed by the mouth-watering smell of roasting beef and fine ale. The tavern is busy and nobody pays you any special attention as you take a seat by the counter.</p>
<p>At a nearby table, you notice an argument is brewing between a merchant and a man dressed in a shabby hide coat. The merchant is accusing the man of stealing a purse of gems from his pocket, and the confrontation is being made worse by a third man, a lank-haired bargee, who is siding with the merchant. The accused man pleads that he is innocent but the other two give no credence to his pleas. Suddenly, the merchant draws a dagger and threatens to slit the man’s throat unless he hands over the stolen gems at once.</p>
