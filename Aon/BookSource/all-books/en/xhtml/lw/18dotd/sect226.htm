<h3>226</h3>

<p>Your hurried blow rips a jagged hole in the wing of the beast, and, suddenly off-balanced by the wound, it loses control and slams into the ground with a sickening crunch. You give a cry of elation, and then you hear Captain D’Val’s strident voice rising above the din of the battle:</p>
<p>‘Ride on, Lone Wolf!’ he shouts. ‘Ride to the monastery!’</p>
<p>You glance over your shoulder and see the captain and his men locked in combat with the winged creatures. More are swooping in from the east now, drawn by the cries of their brothers. The tide of the battle is turning against D’Val’s men and your heart goes out to them as they struggle bravely against increasing odds. Your instinct is to turn back, but you heed the captain’s plea and urge your horse on towards the top of the ridge. The best way you can serve these courageous men now is to reach the Kai Monastery and destroy the Shadow Gate.</p>
