<h3>255</h3>

<p>Cearmaine is overcome with grief by his son’s death. With trembling hands he takes the bloodstained tunic from beneath the young man’s head, unfolds it, and drapes it over his lifeless body. To your surprise, you note the insignia on the lapels are similar to those on Cearmaine’s uniform; his son held the rank of captain, the same as his father.</p>
<p>‘I must go to his regiment,’ he says, his voice wavering. ‘It is right and fitting that I take command of them now.’</p>
<p>After attending to the burial of his son, the grieving captain returns to the Canatarium to find out where his son’s regiment is stationed. He learns they are at the Reloni Bridge, at the very heart of the battle. Before he leaves, he thanks you for trying to save his son’s life and he suggests two routes by which you can reach the distant city of Casiorn from here.</p>
<p>The first route is the most direct, but it is also the most hazardous. It requires you to pass through the enemy lines at the Reloni Bridge, cross the southern tip of Eldenora, and then continue your journey north by way of the Slovarian Plain.</p>
<p>The second route will avoid the fighting at the Reloni Bridge, but it would mean having to pass through the city of Duadon—Prince Lutha’s stronghold.</p>
<p>(Consult the <a href="map.htm">map</a> before making your choice.)</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to take the Reloni Bridge/Slovarian Plain route to Casiorn, <a href="sect271.htm">turn to 271</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to take the Duadon/Rhem route instead, <a href="sect38.htm">turn to 38</a>.</p>
