<h3>27</h3>

<p>You take a gasp of air and dive below the surface, but as you submerge, you feel the stinging kiss of a crossbow bolt’s tip graze your shoulder: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Having lost the element of surprise, you allow the current to carry you a few hundred yards downstream before you come to the surface. You find yourself opposite a shallow bay in the river bank which affords you better cover from the nearest enemy trench than your previous position upstream. Quickly you crawl out of the water and slither like a snake up the muddy bank to drop silently into this trench. A dull-witted Eldenoran is swiftly dispatched with a blow from the edge of your hand, enabling you to move further along this log-walled ditch. Just as you are passing the opening to a makeshift dugout, you sense danger ahead. A single file of Eldenoran swordsmen is marching along the trench in your direction; it will be only a matter of seconds before they are close enough to see you.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to dive into the dugout to avoid being seen by these men, <a href="sect185.htm">turn to 185</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to unsheathe your weapon and prepare for combat with this advancing file of troops, <a href="sect57.htm">turn to 57</a>.</p>
