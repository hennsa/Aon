<h3>299</h3>

<p>You are woken at dawn by one of Dorst’s men who immediately hands you a steaming mug of Huas, a delicious Palmyrion beverage. You notice the others are in various states of waking and, as you sip your reviving drink, you watch Dorst shaving at the stream. After a while the Baroness emerges from her carriage. She appears as fresh as a spring flower, and together you breakfast before the camp is struck and you go your separate ways.</p>
<p>‘If ever you visit Lucia Province,’ she says, leaning from the open window of her carriage, ‘be sure to visit my estate in Gadorvo.’</p>
<p>‘I would be honoured, my lady,’ you reply, and wave to her until, at last, her carriage and riders disappear into the hills.</p>
<p>The weather is warmer than of late and you make good progress despite the poor condition of the road. An hour past midday, as you are crossing a treeless valley, you happen upon a young man praying at a wayside shrine. He is dressed in a guildsman’s tunic and cloak, and he appears to be unarmed.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stop and question this young man, <a href="sect170.htm">turn to 170</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to ignore him and continue on your way, <a href="sect19.htm">turn to 19</a>.</p>
