<h3>307</h3>

<p>For several hours you wait in the crowded Canatarium for Captain Cearmaine to return. Then, shortly before nightfall, the captain enters by the main doors, his head bowed with sorrow. You sense at once that his son has died of his wounds, and you try to console him as best you can.</p>
<p>‘I must go to his regiment,’ says Cearmaine, his voice full of emotion. ‘It is right and fitting that I take command of them now.’</p>
<p>You learn that his son’s regiment is stationed at the Reloni Bridge, at the very heart of the battle. Before the captain leaves, he wishes you good luck and suggests two routes by which you can reach the distant city of Casiorn from here.</p>
<p>The first route is the most direct, but it is also the most hazardous. It requires you to pass through the enemy lines at the Reloni Bridge, cross the southern tip of Eldenora, and then continue your journey north by way of the Slovarian Plain.</p>
<p>The second route will avoid the fighting at the Reloni Bridge, but it would mean having to pass through the city of Duadon—Prince Lutha’s stronghold. (Consult the <a href="map.htm">map</a> before making your choice.)</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to take the Reloni Bridge/Slovarian Plain route to Casiorn, <a href="sect271.htm">turn to 271</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to take the Duadon/Rhem route instead, <a href="sect38.htm">turn to 38</a>.</p>
