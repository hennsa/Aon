<h3>327</h3>

<p>With renewed vigour you swim against the powerful current and reach the distant shore. As you emerge from the water you are thankful for two reasons: for having survived the crossing, and for having escaped in one piece from the hostile land of Eldenora.</p>
<p>Once you are fully recovered, you put on your boots and cloak and take stock of your surroundings. You have emerged from the Storn at a wooded stretch of river bank, less than a mile south of the city of Rhem. You set off along a track heading north and, within a few minutes, you catch sight of the city’s walls and its famous horseshoe-shaped harbour.</p>
<p>You enter the city by its south gate, using your Kai camouflage skills and your natural stealth to avoid the attentions of the watchful guards. Once inside, you merge with the crowds and soon find yourself in a square that is overshadowed by the twin towers of Rhem Cathedral. An avenue runs along the cathedral’s south side and, at its far end, your eye is drawn to a rusty suit of armour which stands beside the door to a dingy-looking weapons shop.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter this armoury, <a href="sect339.htm">turn to 339</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide not to enter, <a href="sect36.htm">turn to 36</a>.</p>
