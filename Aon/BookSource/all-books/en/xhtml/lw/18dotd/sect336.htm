<h3>336</h3>

<p>With stunning speed and accuracy, you let loose an Arrow at the leading Eldenoran rider. The tip punctures his forehead and sends him tumbling backwards, his limbs flailing wildly, to disappear into the tall plains grass. Shocked by your bow-skill, the brigand leader shouts a recall to his men. They wheel about and form up in a line behind him, cursing you for the death of their confederate. Then, with a vengeful yell, the brigand chief leads his gang of ruffians in a charge he hopes will trample you into the ground.</p>
<p>You shoulder your Bow and draw a hand weapon as the wave of brigands come thundering down upon you. The leader flashes past, his sword blade whistling inches from your scalp, but he does not get very far. You turn in the saddle and strike like lightning, splitting his helmet and his skull with a single mighty blow. He falls before his men, but they prove to be hardy rogues and they press home their attack regardless.</p>
