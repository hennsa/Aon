<h3>337</h3>

<p>You rush to the brigand’s side and wrench the dagger from his chest. The wound is deep and you sense that it has penetrated his heart; he has only seconds to live. Calling upon your advanced healing skills, you cause the torn tissues of his heart wall to knit together sufficiently enough to stem the bleeding.</p>
<p>‘How do you know my name?’ you demand. ‘Who sent you here? What is your purpose?’</p>
<p>The brigand tries to smile through his pain and a trickle of crimson blood runs from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>‘You … you are the reason I’m here,’ he whispers. ‘I came here looking to finish you. I am finished now … Lutha will not be pleased.’</p>
<p>Then a fit of coughing re-opens his punctured heart. With a final gurgling gasp, he expires in your arms. You get to your feet and look around at the devastation he and his men have brought to the sleepy village of Pinepeaks. Leaderless, the remaining brigands abandon their loot and flee to the wooded hills to rejoin their confederates, those who attempted to ambush the troop when first you entered this valley. Nathor’s men have secured the village and they are helping the villagers to fight the fires which are burning in several of the cottages.</p>
