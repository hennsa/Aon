<h3>347</h3>

<p>You fight with the devastating speed and skill that only a Kai Grand Master possesses. Despite the overwhelming odds against you, you succeed in defeating every last one of these vicious hounds. As the last one falls to your blows, you urge your horse away from the coppice and set off along the river track to Scade.</p>
<p>On returning to the Lucky Bucket Inn, you break the news of your encounter at Castle Tranius to the remaining five troopers. It comes as a shock, both to them and to the innkeeper, who fears for the safety of the real Knight Tranius.</p>
<p>‘I haven’t seen him in the town for near-on a week,’ he says, anxiously rubbing his many chins. ‘We ’ere had no inkling that somethin’ bad was happenin’ up there at the castle. It’s right put the shakes up me, I can tell you.’</p>
