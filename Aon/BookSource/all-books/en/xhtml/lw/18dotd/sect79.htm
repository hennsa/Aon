<h3>79</h3>

<p>Using the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mind Charm</i>, you command the prisoner to reveal the identity of the person who sent him here to Garthen to murder you. At first you are unable to penetrate the man’s mind—his memory is protected by a magical shield. Then you draw on your psychic Kai skills to boost the <i>Mind Charm</i> spell and suddenly you feel the man’s magical shield begin to crack and disintegrate.</p>
<p>The man shrieks with fear as his body is racked by convulsions. A mass of images swirls and solidifies in your mind’s eye—they are images of a past meeting in a far-off place which you recognize to be Duadon, the capital city of Eldenora. You see a shadowy figure, sheathed in ornate chainmail, handing a bulging pouch of gold to the prisoner in a dimly lit alleyway. The figure speaks your name before melting away into the shadows.</p>
<p>‘Who is this person?’ you say, commanding the trembling prisoner to answer. He parts his bruised lips and tries to utter a name but no sound emerges. You sense that he is fighting to overcome the remnants of the shielding spell placed upon his mind. Moving closer, you try to make out the name he is struggling hard to whisper.</p>
