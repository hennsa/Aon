<h3>8</h3>

<p>You bow to the King’s wishes and resolve, instead, to reach the Kai Monastery by land and destroy the Shadow Gate as soon as you are able. Strengthened by this resolution, you show to the council the Sun-crystal that Gwynian gave you, and you tell them how you intend to use it.</p>
<p>Ulnar and the barons applaud your plan and your steadfast courage. The King places under your command his élite Guard Cavalry regiment, so that you may be able to use them to break through the enemy’s line at its weakest point and reach the Kai Monastery. Captain D’Val, commander of the Guard Cavalry, knows where this weak point is and he will guide you to it.</p>
<p>The King dissolves the council and, as the barons return to their armies in the field, he orders you to rest in his chambers for a few hours.</p>
<p>‘Get some sleep, Grand Master,’ he says, patting you paternally on the shoulder. ‘You will need it. You ride with the Guard at dawn.’</p>
