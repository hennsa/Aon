<h3>9</h3>

<p>Quickly you intone the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <i>Hold Enemy</i> and direct its power at Prince Lutha. Instantly he is frozen into immobility. Your swift action has prevented him from activating the evil power of the ring he wears, a power which could spell your doom. But you sense that it is only a matter of time before your spell wears off and he is free to direct the power of the ring against you.</p>
<p>Seizing the advantage, you call on your Magnakai skills of Pathsmanship to aid you as you begin the difficult climb out of the pit. The ascent becomes a race against time; you must reach the open trapdoor before the Prince recovers from the effects of your spell.</p>
<p>You are pulling yourself through the opening when Lutha begins to move. He attempts to kick you with his right foot but you twist away in time to avoid the vicious attack. You tug his left leg and put him off balance; this move buys you the few seconds you need to get to your feet. As you rise he comes at you with a dagger in his hand, forcing you back towards the open hole.</p>
<p class="combat">Prince Lutha (with Ring of Power): <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 54   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 39</p>
<p>While wearing the Ring of Power, Lutha is immune to all forms of psychic attack, except Kai-surge and Kai-blast.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect89.htm">turn to 89</a>.</p>
