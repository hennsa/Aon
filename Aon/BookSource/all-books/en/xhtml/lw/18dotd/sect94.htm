<h3>94</h3>

<p>As the sun rises above the waters of the Holmgulf, it sheds its golden light upon the hopeful citizens of Holmgard who have gathered to cheer your departure. You ride out of the King’s Citadel at the head of the Guard Cavalry regiment, with Captain D’Val at your side. Bouquets of Sommlending roses are thrown before the hooves of your warhorse, and your ears ring to the jubilant cries of the crowd as you, and the brave horsemen at your back, ride with pride through the city streets that lead to Holmgard’s north gate.</p>
<p>Once outside the city, you order your troop to couch their lances and form up in column, four abreast, in readiness for a swift ride north. At midday, you cross the River Unoram and meet with a patrol of Border Rangers who are guarding a junction. A track emerges from the Fryelund Forest and joins with the main road from the west at this point. Although it is unsigned, you recognize its rutted surface at once: it is the Alema Trail, one of several forest tracks which lead to the Kai Monastery, thirty miles distant. Captain D’Val tells you that the enemy line is weakest at a place several miles along this trail.</p>
<p>The Border Rangers come quickly to attention when they see you approaching. Their leader, a sergeant with a battle-wounded leg, warns you that the enemy were seen earlier flying over this area of the forest. You acknowledge his salute, and then you give the order for the regiment to form up in column, two abreast, before leading them along the trail and into the Fryelund Forest.</p>
<p>You have covered less than a mile of this woodland track when you find yourself descending a gentle slope towards a stream, a tributary of the Unoram. There once was a bridge which crossed the watercourse at this point, but it has long since collapsed. Its ancient stones now form a ford which carries the trail over to the far side of the stream.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Grand Huntmastery and have attained the Kai rank of Sun Lord or higher, <a href="sect203.htm">turn to 203</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to attain this level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect151.htm">turn to 151</a>.</p>
