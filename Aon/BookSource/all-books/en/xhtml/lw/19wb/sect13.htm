<h3>13</h3>

<p>You hit the ground with a numbing jolt and almost lose consciousness. As you lie there, dazed and gasping for breath, you hear the anxious voices of your companions swirling around in your mind. You cannot move but you are able to draw on your Magnakai Curing skills to staunch your bleeding wounds. Gradually you feel your strength returning. The young Kai gather around and lift you carefully to your feet. As your vision clears, you see that the doorway to the tomb is now devoid of rubble. You sense that the destructive force of the power-glyph has been discharged, but only temporarily. It is recharging, and you have but a few seconds in which to enter the tomb before the deadly device is fully active once more.</p>
<p>‘Quickly, my lords,’ you gasp, as you break free of their grasp and stagger towards the entrance, ‘follow me!’</p>
<p>They hesitate, fearing you are about to trigger yet another explosion. ‘Hurry!’ you cry. ‘The trap is spent but its power is fast returning. We must enter now!’</p>
