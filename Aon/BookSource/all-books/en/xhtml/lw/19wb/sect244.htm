<h3>244</h3>

<p>The huge dragonfly swoops down like a hunting hawk and attempts to skewer you upon the sharp tip of its spear-like proboscis. You wait until the very last moment before twisting aside to avoid its lunge and, as it streaks past, you deal it a backhanded blow which tears a hole in its silvery wing. The wound is not fatal, but the damage to its wing is enough to render the hungry creature incapable of ascending any higher. It emits a loud buzz of frustration which fades as it slowly spirals away towards a cluster of smaller dragonflies hovering near the centre of the gorge.</p>
<p>At length you reach the apex of the cavern and soar into the light-filled vent. Upon entering this vast aperture you are buffeted by crosswinds which sweep you precariously towards its rocky lip. Only your Kai Mastery and your lightning-swift reactions save you from being crushed to death as you are blown towards its jagged, volcanic edge.</p>
<p>You survive the impact and are able to haul yourself out of the vent and climb safely onto a surface that you assume to be the roof of the cavern. Seeking shelter from the raging crosswinds, you squeeze yourself into a hollow in the porous rock from where you are able to take stock of your new surroundings. The sight makes you gasp, for it is a view that truly rivals the fertile wonders of the cavern below.</p>
