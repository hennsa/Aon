<h3>255</h3>

<p>Naar moves from the dais and commands Kekataag to cease his psychic assault. The murderous leviathan complies at once with his fell master’s wishes. For the first time since he strode into this throne hall, Kekataag turns to face Naar. His intent is to bow his huge form in dutiful deference to his master’s authority, but this formality is soon forgotten when his psychic powers detect the presence of Alyss. The realization that she is here makes the warrior bellow with supernatural rage. The deafening sound galvanizes Alyss into action; she leaps towards the plinth and places both of her hands upon the surface of the Moonstone. Instantly a whirling hole appears in the smoky wall of the throne hall; it is the unmistakable mouth of a Shadow Gate.</p>
<p>‘Flee, Lone Wolf,’ she cries. ‘Flee to your homeland before it’s too late!’</p>
<p>Bravely she stands her ground, her hands clasped upon the glowing Moonstone, as Kekataag and Naar advance upon her from two sides. You are deeply moved by the courage of this enigmatic being; it seems she is prepared to sacrifice her immortality that you might escape alive from this terrible place.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to obey her command and enter the whirling Shadow Gate, <a href="sect282.htm">turn to 282</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to stay and fight the Dark God and his evil avenger, <a href="sect343.htm">turn to 343</a>.</p>
