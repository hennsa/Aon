<h3>260</h3>

<p>Baron Caldar escorts you and Banedon to the roof of his castle’s main tower where, hovering above, you see the great gleaming hull of the Guildmaster’s skyship—<cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. At Banedon’s signal a cage is lowered from the stern of this magical vessel and, after bidding farewell to the Baron, you are both hoisted aboard. The crew, some of whom are survivors from his previous skyship—<cite>Skyrider</cite>—are clearly agitated by your unexpected appearance; the sibilant hiss of their fearful whispers echoes softly along the deck. But immediately Banedon vouches that you are not the impostor who has terrorized Sommerlund these past few weeks and this swiftly allays his crew’s suspicions. As you accompany the Guildmaster to his quarters, the mood of the men and dwarves of the ship’s complement changes. Respectfully they salute you and welcome you with pride aboard their wondrous craft.</p>
<p>The <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> sets sail and follows a southwesterly bearing for the city of Tyso, over one hundred miles distant. The night sky is clear and Javano, the ship’s pilot, is confident that you will arrive within the hour. During the brief voyage, Banedon communicates magically with the elders of his Brotherhood in Toran. He informs them of your safe return and tells them of your plans to track down the impostor. In response they assure him that word of your return will be conveyed at once to the King in Holmgard, and to your beleaguered kinsmen at the Kai Monastery. This glad news does much to lift your bruised spirits.</p>
<p>It seems as if you have been aboard the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> for no more than a few minutes when a message arrives from the forward lookout: ‘Tyso lights due south.’ You leave Banedon’s comfortable quarters below deck and accompany him to the prow rail from where you catch your first aerial glimpse of the distant city-port. The warm lantern light of hovels and taverns shimmers like a captive cluster of stars within the city’s protective wall. At the Guildmaster’s command, Javano begins the skyship’s descent and, as the twinkling lights loom larger, you are able to make out the silhouette of a grand castle that is perched on a headland overlooking the harbour.</p>
<p>‘There’s our destination, Lone Wolf,’ says Banedon, cheerfully, ‘the castle of Baron Tor Medar—the Seneschal of Tyso.’</p>
