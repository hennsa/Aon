<h3>268</h3>

<p>The buttress and the rope plummet into the fissure and are lost to an underground river far below. For a few terrible seconds Steel Hand swings precariously from the ceiling; then his fingers lose their purchase and he, too, tumbles into the abyss.</p>
<p>You and your young Kai comrades rush to the edge of the fissure, fearing the worst. But Steel Hand has not fallen into the raging river to be carried out to sea; he is still in sight. Your infravision reveals him to be lying on a rocky ledge less than twenty feet below. He has been knocked unconscious by the fall but thankfully he is still alive.</p>
<p>It takes nearly an hour to retrieve Steel Hand from the ledge and then cross safely to the far side of the fissure. During this time, unless you possess Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>‘Come, my lords,’ you say, mindful of the unwelcome dangers and delays you have so far endured, ‘we must press on. We’ve yet to find our quarry’s trail.’</p>
