<h3>290</h3>

<p>Your experienced eye is drawn to the chamber’s north wall. You step closer and magnify your vision, which enables you to detect two faint hairline cracks in the damp granite surface. They run vertically from the floor to the ceiling and appear to be the outline of a secret panel. But all is not what it seems. You utter the words of the advanced Brotherhood Spell <i>See Illusion</i>, and the truth is swiftly revealed. The panel does not exist: it is a skilful illusion. With the memory of the power-glyph you encountered at the tomb entrance still fresh in your mind, you command your companions to stand with their backs against the south wall. Then you scoop a handful of gravel from the floor and hurl it at the north wall. There is a sudden flash of blue-white light which melts into a shower of hissing sparks as the gravel passes through the illusory panel, dissipating its energy.</p>
<p>‘Just as I thought—another trick!’ you say, as you unsheathe your weapon and signal to your comrades to follow your lead. ‘Be on your guard, my lords. We’re hunting a cunning foe.’</p>
