<h3>298</h3>

<p>This tunnel gradually descends by slope and stair through deeper levels of the catacombs. You detect no trace of the impostor and, when eventually the tunnel comes to a dead end, you curse your ill luck and turn reluctantly to retrace your steps. It is then that you sense a faint but lingering aura of Evil close to the tunnel floor.</p>
<p>Closer inspection reveals a trapdoor set into the flagstones. You pull this heavy hatch open and uncover a circular chute and a ladder descending into darkness. Your heart misses a beat when you notice fresh tracks on the ladder’s iron rungs; at last you have found the impostor’s trail.</p>
<p>Cautiously you lead the descent into the chute, using your powers of infravision to scan for signs of movement in the damp darkness below. After several minutes you reach the bottom of the ladder where you discover a large vaulted chamber. Around its walls are positioned urns and grey stone caskets, each embellished with traces of gold. There is an unexpected air of opulence about this vault which prompts you to guess that it is a secret burial tomb.</p>
