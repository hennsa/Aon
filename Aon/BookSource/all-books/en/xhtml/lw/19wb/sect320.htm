<h3>320</h3>

<p>The two reptilians have exhausted their supply of arrows and are frantically working at the chain in an effort to lower their iron pot to the floor of the vault. You can see that it will only be a matter of minutes before they accomplish their task.</p>
<p>Anxious to evade them, you examine the portal for a lever or some other means to make it rise. To the left of the tunnel arch you discover two squares of opaque crimson gemstone separated by a small slot. The squares are similar in size and design to those you encountered at the entrance to the temple of Avaros. These, too, comprise a locking mechanism that controls this portal. By tapping upon each square a correct number of times you will cause the lock to disengage and the portal to rise.</p>
<p>You place your fingers lightly upon the squares and feel the tell-tale vibrations that are the key to deciphering the secret code. After only seconds you are able to determine that the first code is equal to the number of islands south of the Kirlundin island of Hemd.</p>
<p>The second code is equal to the number of villages that lie on the highway between the cities of Toran and Anskaven.</p>
<p>In order to discover the exact numbers that will open the portal, consult the <a href="map.htm">map</a>.</p>
<p class="puzzle">When you think you know the two-digit solution, <a href="numbered.htm">turn to the entry</a> that is the same number as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect320-1-foot" name="sect320-1">19</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you cannot decipher the codes, <a href="sect213.htm">turn instead to 213</a>.</p>
