<h3>337</h3>

<p>‘This way, my lords!’ shouts Foilan, as he spurs his black mare along a mist-wreathed street that snakes through Tyso’s shabby North Quarter. The street is deserted yet many citizens witness your passing. Their eyes glint in the moonlight as they peep through the smoky yellow panes of their windows, their curiosity and fears awakened by the clatter of your horses’ hooves.</p>
<p>At length the street opens onto a wider avenue which gently descends towards a sprawling expanse of derelict ground surrounded by a tall, moss-covered perimeter wall. Several dozen guards and rangers have gathered at a distant archway in this wall and, by magnifying your vision, you can see that they have erected a barricade which completely blocks the entrance to the burial ground beyond.</p>
<p>The Reeve-lieutenant tells you to wait here with your men. Then he goes forward to inform the guards of the situation and to tell them that you and your companions are not Kai impostors. On seeing his signal, you move forward and join him at the archway. At his command, the guards hurriedly clear away some of the rubble which fills the entrance, enabling the five of you to dismount and proceed into the necropolis on foot.</p>
<p>In the moonlight, the burial ground has a certain ghostly beauty. There is an aura of sad serenity surrounding its mouldering tombs as, with the passing of centuries, they crumble to dust and disappear with their secret memories of another age. But all is not what it seems. Your Sixth Sense detects the lingering aura of an evil entity that has invaded this place. A glance at your fellow Kai tells you that they, too, can sense its presence.</p>
<p>You clasp the Platinum Amulet and feel a tingling vibration run through the palm of your hand. The sensation grows stronger as you move along a weed-choked path which leads to a shadowy tomb. With the passage of the years this tomb has settled lopsidedly into the soft Tysoan earth, yet a flight of damp stone steps descends to where its door once was. As you draw nearer, you notice that all that now remains of the door is a mound of broken rubble.</p>
