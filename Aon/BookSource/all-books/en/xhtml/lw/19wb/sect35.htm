<h3>35</h3>

<p>Steel Hand and the other Kai clear away the rubble to reveal a trapdoor set into the floor. You command Star Lynx to tie one end of his rope to its bronze ring and then together, from a safe distance, you pull open this stone hatch. No traps are sprung as the heavy slab of stone creaks open, and when you move closer, you see a circular chute and a ladder descending to a deeper level of the catacombs. You peer down into the darkness and you detect fresh tracks on the ladder’s iron rungs. You are back on the impostor’s trail.</p>
<p>Cautiously you lead the descent into the chute, using your powers of infravision to scan for signs of movement in the damp darkness below. After several minutes you reach the bottom of the ladder where you discover a large, vaulted chamber. Around its walls are positioned urns and grey stone caskets, each embellished with traces of gold. There is an unexpected air of opulence about this vault which prompts you to guess that it is a secret burial tomb.</p>
