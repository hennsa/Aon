<h3>37</h3>

<p>As your enemy’s platform passes through the next level of the tower, he leaps off and disappears from view. A few moments later, when your platform reaches this level, Wolf’s Bane is nowhere to be seen. You step into the circular chamber and cast your eyes around its bare metallic surfaces. There is only one exit from here: a narrow tunnel in the north wall.</p>
<p>Quickly you enter this tunnel and discover footprints in the dust which blankets the floor. You follow the tracks, but they soon fade and then disappear completely. You stop to examine the floor and your tracking skills tell you that your adversary is deliberately masking his trail. Determined not to give up the pursuit, you break into a run and hurry along this tunnel to where it makes a sharp turn to the left. What you see filling the corridor ahead brings you skidding to a halt.</p>
<p>The way is blocked by a criss-crossed tangle of thick, gluey strands, which are anchored to the floor, walls, and ceiling. You sense that Wolf’s Bane has cast this magical net to ensnare and delay you while he makes good his escape.</p>
