<h3>49</h3>

<p>With mixed feelings of fear and fascination you force open your eyes and gaze upon your alien surroundings. At first it seems as if you have fallen into a humid, green-walled cell, illuminated by a solitary lantern at the apex of a fluted chimney-like ceiling. Then slowly your mind makes sense of sights and smells, and the realization of where you are makes you shiver with dread.</p>
<p>You have landed inside the corolla tube of some gigantic flower. Huge stamens rise up to the light from the sticky bowl-shaped floor on which you lie, and nearby there is a large, chute-like tunnel which drops away into the plant’s hollow stem. For a moment you close your eyes and let your psychic senses explore this strange environment. Your greatest fear is that you have been drawn through the Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness, the supernatural realm of the Dark God Naar, yet you can detect no abnormally high concentrations of Evil. Also, you are unable to sense the presence of your adversary—Wolf’s Bane. Your hopes begin to rise when suddenly you realize that you are still somewhere within the material universe of Aon. You are able to determine that this alien place is not your home world, yet you are certain that it is a planet that lies within the same galaxy as Magnamund.</p>
<p>You cling to this small crumb of comfort and resolve to find a way of returning to Magnamund as quickly as you can. You open your eyes and stare around the walls of your plant-prison, searching for a means of escape. There appear to be only two ways out: by climbing a stamen towards the light high above, or by sliding down the nearby chute which plunges deep into the plant’s stem.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to climb a stamen, <a href="sect264.htm">turn to 264</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to slide down the hollow stem, <a href="sect103.htm">turn to 103</a>.</p>
