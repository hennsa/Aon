<h3>51</h3>

<p>You relax the tension in your body and allow yourself to enter a trance state, the preliminary stage required before you spirit-walk. You feel yourself leave your corporeal body and, in spirit form, you move through the curtain of vines and out into the jungle heat. Immediately beyond the cave mouth there is a small clearing which slopes away to the jungle perimeter. You scan the border of dense foliage, and you are shocked when you detect your adversary, Wolf’s Bane, hiding among the bushes less than fifty yards away. He is armed with a bow which he has trained upon the entrance to the tunnel.</p>
<p>You retreat into the cave mouth and re-enter your body. On awakening from your trance, you move forward and peer through the hanging vines to locate your enemy’s hiding place. So advanced is his camouflage skill that it takes you several minutes to find him. Once you are sure you have him, you allow yourself a smile; you are looking forward to turning the tables on this arrogant impostor.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a Bow and wish to use it, <a href="sect196.htm">turn to 196</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Grand Nexus and have attained the rank of Kai Grand Crown (and wish to use your mastery), <a href="sect43.htm">turn to 43</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not have a Bow or the Discipline of Grand Nexus, or if you have yet to attain this higher level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect114.htm">turn to 114</a>.</p>
