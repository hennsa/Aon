<h3>7</h3>

<p>Guided by a circle of blazing beacons, Javano the pilot lands the skyship expertly in the middle of a paved training park located within the castle’s expansive grounds. In Tyso a curfew is in force, and the only figures lawfully abroad this night are Baron Medar’s guardsmen, whose numbers have been doubled by a regiment of Border Rangers recently arrived from Holmgard. Banedon suggests that you stay on board until he has informed Baron Medar of the true situation.</p>
<p>‘The guards of Tyso are under orders to kill you on sight,’ he says, as he gets ready to disembark. ‘It would not be wise to show yourself, Grand Master, until I have explained all to the Baron.’</p>
<p>You remain in his quarters while Banedon seeks an audience with Baron Medar. Shortly he returns with the Baron who, upon entering the cabin, greets you warmly like a father welcoming home a favourite son.</p>
<p>‘You will always be welcome here, Lone Wolf,’ he says, clasping your hand in friendship. ‘I knew in my heart that you were innocent of these crimes which have so shocked our people. You may rely on me to help you find this impostor who has sought to harm us and bring dishonour upon your good name.’</p>
<p>You thank the Baron for his support and his pledge of loyalty, and you tell him how pleased you are to be in Tyso after the months you have spent abroad.</p>
<p>‘Then come, my lord, let’s adjourn to my hall where you may enjoy the hospitality of my court,’ he says, and turns to leave the cabin. As he reaches the door he says: ‘Oh, and by the way, there are some men waiting there who, I’m sure, will be most pleased to meet with you.’</p>
