<h3>9</h3>

<p>Your killing blow punctures the beast’s single lung and heart, sending it swiftly to the bottom of the flooded cellar. You sheathe your weapon and strike out for the surface where, upon clambering onto the steps, you pause for a few moments to regain your composure. As you recover, you note that one of your Backpack Items is missing, lost during your underwater combat with the Ekmakon. (Erase from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> the item which you have recorded at the top of your list of Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>Eager to continue your pursuit, you climb the steps and emerge through a trapdoor into the rubble-heaped city ruins. There is no sign of Wolf’s Bane, but when you hurry to where you saw him last, you discover a flight of steps leading down into a wide underground passage. His tracks can be seen clearly embedded in the muddy floor of this tunnel.</p>
<p>The tunnel passes under a street and then surfaces in front of a grand two-storey building, once a busy warehouse that stored braided coils of fine copper cable. You avoid the main entrance in case your adversary is lying in ambush there, and enter instead by way of a flight of iron steps that lead to a second floor window. The moment you set foot inside the building you sense that Wolf’s Bane is here. Warily you explore, your nerves stretched to breaking point as your eyes seek out detail in the darkness. You are approaching the west wing of this building when you suddenly catch sight of your opponent through a hole in the floor. He is sitting on his haunches behind a mound of wooden crates, busily eating a green-skinned fruit, and he is unaware that you are watching him.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Magi-magic and have attained the rank of Grand Thane (and wish to use your skill), <a href="sect81.htm">turn to 81</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Bow and wish to use it, <a href="sect106.htm">turn to 106</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use it, <a href="sect319.htm">turn to 319</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess none of these skills, have yet to reach the required level of Kai rank, or simply choose not to use them, <a href="sect20.htm">turn instead to 20</a>.</p>
