<h3>92</h3>

<p>The broken buttress and the rope plummet into the fissure and are lost when they hit an underground river far below. Steel Hand swings one-handedly from the ceiling yet he manages to maintain his grip, despite being showered with loose rocks and dust. You command him to return and he obeys readily.</p>
<p>As soon as Steel Hand is back on solid ground, you praise his skill and his brave effort. Only ill luck thwarted him. He offers to try again but you say that it is your turn—he has already proved his courage. Blazer offers you his rope and you accept it; then you walk along the edge of the fissure until you reach the wall. You find it easy to ascend the rough surface and work your way across to a point directly above the fissure. From here you fix the rope to a secure beam and cast the other end to your companions waiting below. One by one you watch them swing across the void and, when all have crossed safely, you untie the rope and make your way over to the far side to join them.</p>
<p>‘Come, my lords,’ you say, as you jump effortlessly down from the wall, ‘we must press on. We’ve a trail to find.’</p>
