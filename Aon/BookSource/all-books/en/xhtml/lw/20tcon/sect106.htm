<h3>106</h3>

<p>Your fear of being engulfed by the approaching fire-storm prompts you to take immediate and decisive action. You leap into the well and a painful jolt runs the entire length of your body as you are consumed by the shimmering light. It feels as if you have just jumped into a pool of ice-cold electricity: lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>The initial shock quickly passes and you surrender yourself to a long descent through a column of glimmering azure light. You feel your Platinum Amulet glowing warmly at your throat and you sense that it is protecting you from the rigours of this journey into the unknown.</p>
<p>Looking down through the curtain of blue light, you can see the roofs of ziggurats and towers rising up to meet you. Gradually you slow to a halt and find yourself standing upon a circular dais of basalt rock atop a large, flat-roofed building. Several yards away to your left you see a squat tower, and to your right, standing at a parapet, you see a horny-skinned creature with wings that glimmer like folded sheets of gold leaf. Your pulse races when you recognize this creature to be a Lavas, one of Naar’s deadly minions. The Lavas is peering idly at the view beyond the parapet and is unaware of your arrival, yet you are reluctant to leave the shimmering beam for fear that it may see you and raise an alarm.</p>
