<h3>120</h3>

<p>The moment you reach firm ground, you sprint headlong across the clearing towards a distant jungle perimeter. At first the giant arachnids give chase, but they prove themselves not to be so agile on dry land, and you are soon able to outdistance them and escape.</p>
<p>On entering the jungle perimeter, you force your way through dense foliage and soon discover the remnants of a trail which you follow for nearly a mile until you arrive at the edge of a second clearing. This area of levelled ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, make your way around the fruits, and hurry across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with a pair of sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door. You detect waves of power emanating from somewhere beyond this darkened doorway, but you are unable to determine just how deep below the ground the source of this energy is located.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Telegnosis and wish to use this skill to spirit-walk through the doorway to investigate what lies beyond, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or choose not to use it, <a href="sect177.htm">turn to 177</a>.</p>
