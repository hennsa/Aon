<h3>160</h3>

<p>You cast your gaze around the mouldering walls of this dimly lit vault and feel a surge of joy and relief well up from the pit of your stomach. The dripping granite is cold and cheerless, but to your eyes, having witnessed the horrors of Naar’s throne hall, this dank stone vault looks warm, welcoming, and reassuringly familiar. You have returned to the secret burial chamber below the Necropolis of Tyso, the place from where you began your journey through the Shadow Gate some time ago. With Alyss’s help you have arrived home safely to Sommerlund.</p>
<p>No trace of the Shadow Gate remains; it vanished the moment you emerged from the cocoon of light and took your first tentative steps into the vault. With eager anticipation you leave the chamber and hurriedly ascend to the surface where you are greeted by warm summer sunshine. The commander of Tyso is Baron Tor Medar, and two of his stewards are dutifully guarding the gates to the city’s necropolis. When they see you emerge from a mausoleum close by, their jaws drop open in amazement as simultaneously they recognize who you are from the cut and colour of your Grand Master robes. Upon recovering their senses, the stewards volunteer to escort you directly to Baron Medar’s castle. During the brief journey through the city you are shocked to learn that a whole year has passed since you entered the Shadow Gate, even though the time that you spent upon the Plane of Darkness seemed no more than a few days at most.</p>
<p>Baron Medar is an old and trusted friend and he welcomes your safe return to Tyso with a show of great warmth and affection. Having feared for the past year that you had perished during your pursuit of Wolf’s Bane, he is clearly delighted to hear that not only did you survive your ordeal beyond the Shadow Gate, but that you also vanquished the impostor. Naturally you are anxious to return to your Kai brethren without delay and Medar gladly offers his help. He gives you the finest horse in his stables and assigns a troop of his personal bodyguards to escort you swiftly across Sommerlund to the Kai Monastery.</p>
<p>At the monastery you receive a rapturous reception from the ranks of the Kai, for whom your return is the fulfilment of a year’s hopes and prayers. Firestone, the most senior of the New Order warriors, dispatches journeymen to carry word of your triumphant return to the King in Holmgard and to Guildmaster Banedon, the leader of the Magicians’ Guild in Toran. Firestone had rightly assumed command during your absence and, as he accompanies you through the grounds of the monastery to your vault below the Tower of the Sun, you commend him on how well he has conducted his stewardship of the monastery and the training of the Kai in his charge.</p>
<p>‘Thank you, my lord,’ he says with pride, ‘yet truly I cannot lay claim to all of the credit. My duties would have been far harder to fulfil had it not been for the invaluable aid I’ve received from your wise advisors, Lord Rimoah and Lord Ardan of Dessi.’</p>
<p>These two Old Kingdom magicians—Lords Rimoah and Ardan—greet you the moment you enter the vault. Ever since you disappeared into the Shadow Gate a year ago, they have resided at the monastery so that they could assist Firestone with the task of training the New Order Kai.</p>
<p>‘We sensed that you were still alive somewhere in the void beyond the universe of Aon,’ says Rimoah, beaming delightedly, ‘but neither I nor Ardan were able to discern precisely when you would return to Sommerlund. Come, Grand Master, tell us of your adventures beyond the Shadow Gate.’</p>
<p>Eagerly they listen to your account of how you tracked and defeated Wolf’s Bane and escaped from the throne hall of the Dark God. But it is your surprise revelation that Naar possesses the Moonstone of the Shianti which seems to fascinate and frighten them the most.</p>
<p>‘This is grave news indeed, Lone Wolf,’ says Lord Rimoah, in a suddenly sombre tone. ‘The Moonstone contains great power. It can create life and it can also destroy life—utterly. If Naar were able to fully harness its power he could use it to destroy all life on Magnamund. I fear it is just a matter of time before he fathoms its secrets. The Moonstone was once a blessing for the creatures of this world. In Naar’s hand it could become the curse of us all.’</p>
<p>‘I for one shall not permit this,’ you reply defiantly. ‘I shall find the means to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the Moonstone. This I vow. For Sommerlund and the Kai, so long as I live, Naar will never conquer Magnamund!’</p>
<p>‘Your courage is an inspiration to us all, Grand Master,’ says Lord Ardan respectfully.</p>
<p>‘Aye, to us all,’ echoes Lord Rimoah. ‘And be assured, Lone Wolf, soon you <em>will</em> have the opportunity to enact your pledge, for it is within our power to help you fulfil your vow.’</p>
