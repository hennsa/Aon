<h3>183</h3>

<p>Seated on the throne is a huge being whom you judge to be more than seven metres tall. She appears to have the body of a human female, although it is difficult to be completely sure for she is slumped forward over the adjacent table, her face buried in her crossed arms as if asleep. She has a coarse mane of black hair and the skin of her hands has a deathly corpse-like pallor. The few remaining parts of her body which are visible are sheathed in pieces of shiny black armour. Your skin prickles with apprehension when you stare at this sleeping giantess for you sense that she is the Demoness Shamath, the ruler of this realm.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound of approaching footsteps echoes from one of the nearby tunnels. Anxious to avoid the risk of a confrontation, you slip into the chamber and take cover behind one of the icy pillars that encircle the walls. Moments later, you see two robed figures glide into the hall. They are carrying between them a large phial of golden fluid which rests upon a pillow of purple silk. As they pass close by your hiding place, you hastily call upon your Kai skills to mask your physical and mental presence.</p>
