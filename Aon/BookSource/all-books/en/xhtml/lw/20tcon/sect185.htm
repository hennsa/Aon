<h3>185</h3>

<p>Two great scaly legs, each tipped with razor-clawed talons, precede the huge bulk of Huan’zhor as he lowers himself down upon his nest of flames. You take cover as best you can among the piles of treasure, but when his talons descend to within an arm’s length of where you are cowering the Dragonlord suddenly detects your presence. He emits a deafening roar and bolts of flame shoot from his mouth to explode with shattering effect among the piles of precious artefacts that lie close to where you are sheltering. Hurriedly you roll away from your hiding place and unsheathe your weapon as you scramble to your feet. There is now no place for you to hide, and you dare not enter the transporter beam without the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon for fear of certain death. Your quest and survival now depend on the outcome of your imminent combat with the mighty Huan’zhor.</p>
<p class="combat">Huan’zhor the Dragonlord: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 56   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 60</p>
<p>This being is immune to all forms of psychic attack, except Kai-blast and Kai-ray. If you possess a Blue Diamond, you may add 3 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of this combat. If you possess Skarn-Ska, you may add 2 (in addition to all other combat bonuses applicable for this Special Item) to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of this combat.</p>
<p class="choice">Conduct this fight using normal combat procedures. However, as soon as your enemy’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to 20 or less, do not continue. Instead, <a href="sect70.htm">turn immediately to 70</a>.</p>
