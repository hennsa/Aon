<h3>202</h3>

<p>The ridge leads you more than a mile into this unwholesome morass, yet you encounter no sign of animal life. A strange quietness overhangs the swamp, an eerie calm which accentuates the aura of evil that is radiating from every rock and murky pool.</p>
<p>As you press on, the cloudy green sky begins to darken and you sense a storm approaching. Minutes later, a gentle rain begins to fall which turns the surface of the swamp a milky blue. You raise the hood of your cloak and continue, but suddenly you notice that your clothes are giving off wisps of smoke where they have been spattered by the rain. This rain is not water: it is a vile and corrosive acid. Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus protects your flesh from the effects of this acidic rain, but your clothing and equipment are vulnerable. Rather than risk them being ruined, you look around for some place to shelter from the coming storm. The only cover that you are able to discern is a clump of stunted, thorn-studded trees which stand upon a knoll several hundred yards ahead.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery and have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian or higher, <a href="sect123.htm">turn to 123</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to attain this level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect78.htm">turn to 78</a>.</p>
