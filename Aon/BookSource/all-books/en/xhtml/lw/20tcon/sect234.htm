<h3>234</h3>

<p>As the beast leaps from the ramp you jump into the air, pivot in mid-flight, and bring your weapon crashing down upon the top of its skull. The power of your blow deflects the creature and sends it slamming into the wall. It growls in surprise and pain but it does not forget its hunger; it simply shakes its bloodied head and springs once more towards you. Dodging this clumsy attack with ease, you let loose a backhanded swipe which slices a chunk of flesh and muscle from its furry shoulder. It yelps and writhes against the pain, but it still refuses to give up the fight. With lightning speed it recovers and lunges for your chest with its claws. You sidestep but it succeeds in knocking you backwards as its heavy bulk glances your arm. Cursing its tenacity, you steel yourself for what will be a desperate fight to the finish.</p>
<p class="combat">Ghazoul: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 50   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 40</p>
<p>This creature is immune to all forms of psychic attack, except Kai-blast and Kai-ray.</p>
