<h3>246</h3>

<p>Drawing once again upon your knowledge of Brotherhood magic, you utter the words of the spell <i>Teleport</i> and will yourself to move through the air towards a place on the far side of the clearing, close to the jungle perimeter (lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point). At first the arachnids come scurrying onto the shore to follow your line of flight, but you quickly outdistance them and they lose interest and return to the muddy river. As you descend to make your landing you see that, in frustration, they have turned their attention to your grounded canoe which they rip apart with their powerful jaws.</p>
<p>The moment your feet touch the ground, you rush into the jungle and take cover in the dense undergrowth where you happen upon the remnants of a track. You follow this overgrown trail for nearly a mile until you come to the edge of another clearing. This expanse of level ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, making your way around the fruits, and hurry across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with a pair of sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door. You detect waves of power emanating from somewhere beyond this darkened doorway, but you are unable to determine just how deep below the ground the source of this energy is located.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Telegnosis and wish to use this skill to spirit-walk through the doorway to investigate what lies beyond, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or choose not to use it, <a href="sect177.htm">turn to 177</a>.</p>
