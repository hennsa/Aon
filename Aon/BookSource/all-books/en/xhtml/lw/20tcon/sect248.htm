<h3>248</h3>

<p>Beyond the Bridge of the Damned, you enter the vast forest of fire that encircles the perimeter of Naar’s realm. You sense that your Platinum Amulet is keeping you safe from the hellish heat of this region, and your Kai ability to spirit-walk is propelling you on a swift and steady course towards the central crater.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the lip of this crater, the forest of fire comes to an abrupt end and you get your first clear view of the desolation which surrounds the stronghold of Dazganon. Cosmic winds blow across this barren plain, moaning like tortured souls. Now and then you hear cries of pain, bursts of mocking laughter, and haunting alien howls that chill your blood. Then you see swirling gossamer shapes that grow and multiply as your psychic senses become attuned to their presence. Millions of evil souls are swirling around the crater which encompasses Naar’s stronghold, and as you watch their endless passage with a sense of awe and disbelief, you realize that this is the Plain of Despair detailed upon the last page of the Tome of Darkness. You stare at the ceaseless torment of these evil souls and you are deeply shocked by the visage of one spirit which rises out of the howling mass.</p>
