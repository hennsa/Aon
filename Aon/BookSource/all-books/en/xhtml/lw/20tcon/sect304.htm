<h3>304</h3>

<p>You are about to cut your way through this barrier of vines when you notice something very odd: each creeper is trembling slightly, as if it is shivering with cold or fear. You draw back your weapon and take careful aim before striking your first blow which severs three of the thick vines.</p>
<p>As if in response to your attack, the mass of hanging creepers suddenly rises up and flails the air. They lash out at you with stunning ferocity, forcing you to retreat along the trail before their stinging blows: lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point. With mounting dread you realize that these vines are not plants at all: they are hostile living creatures.</p>
<p>Beneath the coating of moss which sheathes them are hundreds of tiny hollow barbs, easily capable of ripping flesh to shreds. One passes close to your face and you strike out at it, cutting it in half. It emits a high-pitched squeal as it recoils, trailing a spray of sticky green slime from its sundered tip. As if enraged by their companion’s cry of pain, the other vines come snaking towards you with increased tenacity. You must fight them.</p>
<p class="combat">Haemodyls: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 49   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 47</p>
<p>These vine-creatures are immune to all forms of psychic attack, except Kai-blast and Kai-ray. If you possess Animal Mastery, you may add 2 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of this fight.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect19.htm">turn to 19</a>.</p>
