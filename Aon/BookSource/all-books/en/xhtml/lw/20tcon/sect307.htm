<h3>307</h3>

<p>Rimoah ushers you to a refectory table at the entrance to the chamber where Lord Ardan is carefully arranging some magically-crafted artefacts upon a sheet of scarlet silk. He invites you to inspect these items and Lord Ardan steps aside to allow you a closer look. The first object to catch your eye is a double-edged sword with a jewel-encrusted hilt. The blade looks exceptionally sharp and appears to have been crafted from a rich golden alloy. It shimmers brightly, like sunlight on water, even in the gloom of this torchlit chamber.</p>
<p>‘This is “Skarn-Ska”,’ says Rimoah proudly. ‘It was crafted by Lord Ardan and myself in the weapons forge at the Kai Monastery, during your absence. It was tempered in spell-fire and is imbued with Old Kingdom magic. It will never lose its razor-keen edge. There are few blades better suited to the slaying of the Dark God’s foul spawn than this.’</p>
<p>‘Aye,’ comments Ardan, ‘and we have named it in your honour, Grand Master. In the tongue of the Old Kingdoms, “Skarn-Ska” means “Wolf’s Blade”.’</p>
