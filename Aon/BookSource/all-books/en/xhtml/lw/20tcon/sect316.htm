<h3>316</h3>

<p>As you strike the killing blow that finishes the last of these hideous arachnids, you drag yourself out of the thick mud and collapse on the crest of the river bank. But you allow yourself just a few moments to recover from the fatigue of combat before you are once again back on your feet and on the move.</p>
<p>You cross the clearing to a perimeter of jungle on its far side. Here you force your way through thick foliage until you discover the remnants of a trail which leads you to the edge of a second clearing. This expanse of open ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, make your way around the fruits, and hurry towards a gigantic statue which sits crouched among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door. You detect waves of power emanating from somewhere beyond this darkened doorway, but you are unable to determine just how deep below the ground the source of this energy is located.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Telegnosis and wish to use this skill to spirit-walk through the doorway to investigate what lies beyond, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or choose not to use it, <a href="sect177.htm">turn to 177</a>.</p>
