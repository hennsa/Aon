<h3>327</h3>

<p>The sight of Huan’zhor fast approaching galvanizes you into action. You abandon your physical search for the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon, and instead you close your eyes and focus your psychic Kai skills in an attempt to detect its presence. The tactic seems to work for the image of the scarab crystallizes in your mind’s eye, but when you open your eyes you are disappointed to discover that you are staring at a seemingly plain orb of gold. Through the wall of flames you can see Huan’zhor flaring his mighty wings; he is slowing his approach to the temple in preparation to land upon his nest of fire. In desperation, you stoop to retrieve the orb from among the other treasures and, as your fingers touch its golden surface, it breaks open to reveal the scarab within. Moments later the shadow of Huan’zhor darkens the nest—he is now seconds away from landing.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to keep the scarab and leap into the transporter beam, <a href="sect155.htm">turn to 155</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to pocket the scarab and find a place in the nest where you can hide from the approaching Dragonlord, <a href="sect64.htm">turn to 64</a>.</p>
