<h3>336</h3>

<p>In the blink of an eye you unshoulder your Bow and draw an Arrow ready to fire. The warrior does not flinch in the face of your swift threat and you soon understand why this is so. As you cast your eyes over his body in search of a target, you are unable to detect any chink in the thick plate armour that encases him. Cursing your mysterious foe, you release your Arrow and send it whistling towards his throat, at a point where the scales of his chest armour meet the lower edge of his great helm. The steel-tipped missile fails to penetrate; it shatters harmlessly on impact and the pieces tumble away into the chasm (erase this Arrow from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>Having now tested his armour, you are in no rush to close for combat with this enemy. If at all possible you would still prefer to use your skills to defeat him at a distance.</p>
