<h3>44</h3>

<p>You hit out at the onrushing column of fire and it connects with the flat of your magical blade. There is a terrific flash of blinding golden light and you feel an electrifying jolt that sets every nerve in your body jangling. You follow through with your blow and send the Künae flame rebounding from your blade to slam into the far wall where it dissipates harmlessly across its surface.</p>
<p>Aware now that the Lord of Decay seated on the right-hand throne is Jantoor, you shout his secret name and immediately the creature becomes immobile. The sight of his frozen form—and the sudden cessation of mind contact—throws his brother-lord into a state of panic and confusion. In a blind rage he utters a curse and, to your horror, you see the maggot swarm emerge from the shadowy recesses of the hall. As the tide of larvae writhe towards you they begin to swell grotesquely in size.</p>
<p>If you are to save yourself from this monstrous horde you must quickly use the secret name of the remaining Künae. But there is no time to consult the Tome of Darkness: you must try to recall the name from memory.</p>
<p class="choice">If you think the secret name is ‘Rhunotar’, <a href="sect96.htm">turn to 96</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you think the secret name is ‘Rhunadan’, <a href="sect311.htm">turn to 311</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you think the secret name is ‘Rhunaguin’, <a href="sect289.htm">turn to 289</a>.</p>
