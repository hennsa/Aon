<h3>47</h3>

<p>The seven riders keep their distance, yet they pass close enough to satisfy their curiosity before they turn and speed away into the void. As you watch them disappear, a deep sense of unease grips you. You are relieved to have avoided a confrontation yet you sense that their departure is but a temporary reprieve; they may yet return in greater numbers.</p>
<p>Shortly after, you witness several objects that appear like comets encircling a cluster of distant stars. As you glide towards these stars the comets break away from their orbit and come soaring to meet you, racing with each other to reach you first. A collision looks imminent, but your mounting fears are soon forgotten when the surfaces of these shooting stars undergo a stunning transformation. Their leading surfaces take on the semblance of human faces.</p>

<p class="choice">If you have never visited this city, <a href="sect91.htm">turn to 91</a>.</p>
