<h3>5</h3>

<p>You have survived the first volley but your ordeal is far from over. As soon as the front rank hurl their spears they retreat to let those behind them come forward to take their places at the rim of the pit. With cool defiance you stare back at this new rank of mutants. This time you count more than thirty spears held ready to be hurled at you upon Nza’pok’s command, far more than you can hope to avoid at once, even with the aid of magic. Yet, despite the overwhelming odds, you refuse to show this loathsome spawn any sign of weakness or despair.</p>
<p>You offer up a silent prayer to the God Kai to protect you, and then suddenly you recall part of the script of the Tome of Darkness that told of a secret name which can bind Nza’pok when spoken aloud. This name could be the key to your survival, yet you have no time left to retrieve the book from your Backpack. If you are to use this secret name you must try to recall it from memory.</p>
<p class="choice">If you think that Nza’pok’s secret name is ‘Hulka’, <a href="sect171.htm">turn to 171</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you think that the name is ‘Khula’, <a href="sect105.htm">turn to 105</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you think that the name is ‘Lukha’, <a href="sect56.htm">turn to 56</a>.</p>
