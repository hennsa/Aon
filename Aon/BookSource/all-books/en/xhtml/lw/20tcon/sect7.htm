<h3>7</h3>

<p>As you listen to the rumbling sound drawing closer, you notice markings in the grit and dust which blankets the ground. You count wheel prints that have been made by several heavy wagons, and there are also innumerable rippled tracks that you cannot readily identify. The only markings you have experienced which bear any resemblance to these tracks were much smaller and were made by a centipede.</p>
<p>The curious tracks have diverted your attention from the approaching noise. You glance along the tunnel and see a dark shape speeding through the gloom. Its width almost completely fills the tunnel.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to wait for it to come closer so that you attempt to identify it, <a href="sect141.htm">turn to 141</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to find somewhere you can hide from it, <a href="sect266.htm">turn to 266</a>.</p>
