<h3>76</h3>

<p>You crouch down among some mossy boulders directly opposite the stairwell to the open entrance. Then, using your Grand Mastery, you let yourself slip into the trance-state that will allow your conscious mind to leave your corporeal body. You continue to see your surroundings as they would appear to your physical eyes, but now you are able to transport yourself freely through the air like a bird.</p>
<p>You glide towards the statue and swoop down through the open portal, pausing momentarily to scan the surrounding arch for hidden traps. Detecting none, you continue deeper into the darkness of this alien edifice. A wide stone ramp descends to a sealed portal which is engraved with runes. You cannot immediately decipher them but you sense that they are evil in design and possess some destructive power locked within their jagged forms. Then the sound of a growl, above and far away, makes you suddenly fearful for the safety of your physical body, and so you leave the portal and ascend rapidly to the surface where you rejoin your dormant form. (Unless you have attained the Kai rank of Sun Lord or higher, you lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points due to the haste with which you have returned to your corporeal body.)</p>
<p>Having already reconnoitred the entrance to your satisfaction, you are able to descend the steps and enter the base of the statue with confidence. You follow the stone ramp down to the sealed portal where you carefully examine the runes which cover every square inch of its surface. You are beginning to fathom some of their secrets when suddenly you hear a noise above and behind you. Instantly you spin on your heel and reach for your weapon, but the outline that you see silhouetted in the archway at the top of the ramp is so shocking that you are unable to close your trembling hand upon it.</p>
