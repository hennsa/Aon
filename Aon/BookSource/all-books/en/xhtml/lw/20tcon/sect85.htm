<h3>85</h3>

<p>The canoe grounds on a submerged boulder a few dozen yards from the beach, forcing you to abandon the craft and wade ashore. You soon discover that the stones littering this beach are slick with an oily residue. Your natural agility overcomes this obstacle but the slippery surface makes it difficult for you to reach the cover of the distant tree-line as swiftly as you would like.</p>
<p>As you draw near to the perimeter of trees you pause for a moment to scan the dark jungle undergrowth. Long streamers of moss-encrusted vines hang from the trees, draping themselves limply over every rock and bough, and a tangled mass of interwoven creepers and low-spreading branches forms a blanket canopy which keeps much of the forest floor in semi-darkness. As you stare into the damp and shadowy foliage, you feel a growing sense of unease. Your burning desire to press on with your quest is suddenly dampened by an overwhelming urge to avoid this jungle.</p>
