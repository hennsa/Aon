<h3>119</h3>

<p>You say farewell to the three marines and wish them a swift and safe journey home to Sommerlund. Then you leave the tavern with Kol and make your way quickly to his ship which is moored at the end of the quay. Two of the Funtal’s guards are patrolling the quayside but they do not challenge you as you board Kol’s vessel. They only seem interested in foreign traders who are entering the harbour rather than those making a hasty departure. The Vassagonians who man the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> seem a friendly crew, and they welcome Kol’s return with cheerful humour. He in turn treats them like sons and it is clear from the way they converse that he is a very popular owner.</p>
<p>The ship sets sail at noon and sails swiftly southwards with a benevolent wind filling its triangular sail. Kol expects the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> to take a day and a half to navigate the two hundred and sixty miles of coastal water between Bir Rabalou and Bisutan. He suggests that you relax and enjoy the voyage, yet despite the fair weather and jovial company you are disturbed by a growing sense of unease. You spend your time on deck for the holds and cabins are filled to the brim with cargo. The only shelter from the sun which scorches the open deck is a makeshift spread of canvas near the stern. You are lying here in the shade when, late in the afternoon, you sense a storm brewing on the horizon.</p>
