<h3>142</h3>

<p>You awake with the dawn feeling refreshed and eager to begin the day’s ride south towards the city of Bir Rabalou. During the morning, you and your travelling companions pass several traders and caravans that are heading north to sell their wares in Cape Kabar. Your fair complexions and Sommlending clothes draw many suspicious glances from the caravan drivers, prompting you to stop when you come to a village shortly after midday. Here the marines go looking for some <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">mhaktis</i>—the flowing grey and white robes traditionally worn by the desert dwellers of Vassagonia. While they busy themselves in the hunt for new clothes, you water and feed the horses at the village stables. You are tending to the horses when you are approached by an elderly street vendor. He is pushing a handcart on which he has displayed the following items for sale:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Scented Oil</li>
<li>3 Candles</li>
<li>Slippers</li>
<li>Copper Cup</li>
<li>Rope</li>
<li>Lantern</li>
<li>Lyre <em>(musical instrument)</em></li>
<li>Ball of Chalk</li>
<li>3 Arrows</li>
</ul>
<p>The vendor’s items cost 1 Gold Crown each (3 Candles or 3 Arrows are respectively considered as 1 item). If you wish to purchase one or more of them, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>After a while the three marines return to the stables. They are now dressed in <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">mhaktis</i> and, when they pull up their hoods, you feel sure that they could pass for native Vassagonians. They bundle and tie their marine uniforms to the saddle blankets of their horses, and then the four of you mount up and leave this village. The sun is sinking below the desert horizon when you come to the next village on the road to Bir Rabalou. It is located on the fringe of a wide beach and it can only be reached by a sandy track which branches away from the main coast road. As you reach this junction you notice a group of local people have gathered around something that has washed up on the beach.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to leave the main road and go down to the beach, <a href="sect24.htm">turn to 24</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to ignore this coastal village and continue your ride south, <a href="sect232.htm">turn to 232</a>.</p>
