<h3>159</h3>

<p>Over a delicious supper of fish roe and steamed vegetables (restore 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points), you learn that the old man’s name is Yranai and that he is a native of Hikas. He was on his way home from Bisutan aboard his flying craft when it developed a mechanical problem, and he was forced to make an unscheduled landing in the hills just a few miles to the south of this town. He is staying overnight at the tavern while the blacksmith repairs the convexor, the device that accidentally snagged your cloak. When you tell Yranai that you are bound for Elzian, he offers to transport you there aboard <cite>Simoom</cite>—his flying craft. To travel the last leg of your journey to Elzian by air would save you many days, especially as you have yet to cross the Great Masourn Mountain Range. Gladly you accept Yranai’s offer, and you agree to meet him in the taproom at dawn so that he can take you to the place in the hills where his craft <cite>Simoom</cite> is grounded.</p>
