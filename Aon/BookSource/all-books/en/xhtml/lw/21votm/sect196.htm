<h3>196</h3>

<p>To your dismay you discover that there are hundreds of tracks covering these cobblestones, and you cannot be sure which of them belong to the creature that you are chasing. Hurriedly you decide to follow the left alley, but as a precaution you direct the militia to go off along the right alley.</p>
<p>After a few hundred yards the alley opens out into a small square surrounded by private houses. There is only one exit from this square, other than the one by which you entered, and it is barred by a heavy iron gate. Lanterns surrounding the square illuminate the flagstones and you are unable to see any tracks that have been made here within the last hour. Suddenly the ghastly howl shreds the silence of the city once more. You focus your keen Kai senses and detect that it came from somewhere beyond the iron gate. Now you are sure that you have come the wrong way.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to retrace your steps back to the junction and enter the right alley, <a href="sect14.htm">turn to 14</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide instead to climb over the iron gate, <a href="sect233.htm">turn to 233</a>.</p>
