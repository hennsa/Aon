<h3>214</h3>

<p>You leave the lodging house and stand outside in the busy market square. While you are watching the city’s lamplighters going about their evening duties, you contemplate your situation. You know that you are going to need to raise some money if you are to reach Elzian without incurring great delays. In fact, the success of your mission could hinge upon it. With this thought foremost in your mind, you hurry across the square and enter a rough-looking hostelry opposite. It is home to several rogues and rascals who spend most of their nights drinking and gambling. You join in one of their dice games and, using your Magnakai skill of Nexus, you manage to win 10 Gold Crowns from them before they suspect something is wrong and they demand you leave.</p>
<p>You go back to the lodging house where the Chai landlady is disappointed to see you return. She is about to tell you to go away when you place 3 Gold Crowns into her hand, payment for one night’s board and breakfast (you may add a total of 7 Gold Crowns to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>: your winnings less your lodging fee).</p>
