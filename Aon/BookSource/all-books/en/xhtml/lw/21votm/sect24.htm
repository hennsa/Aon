<h3>24</h3>

<p>As you ride across the firm sandy beach towards the excited crowd you see that they are gathered around the carcass of a whale. These poor villagers are celebrating their unexpected good fortune for this whale will provide them with food for a month, and enough oil to fuel their lamps until winter. A cheerful-looking old man hails you with his walking stick and you slow your horse to a halt.</p>
<p>‘You be bound for Bir Rabalou, good sirs?’ he asks. ‘ ’Cause if you is, then you’d do well to heed my advice.’</p>
<p>‘And what advice would that be?’ replies Ernan. The old man gives him a thin smile and then hobbles nearer to your horse. He does not say anything; he simply holds out his hand in the hope that you will pay him something for his advice.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to give this old man 1 Gold Crown, <a href="sect219.htm">turn to 219</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose not to give him anything, <a href="sect313.htm">turn to 313</a>.</p>
