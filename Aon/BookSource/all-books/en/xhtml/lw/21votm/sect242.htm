<h3>242</h3>

<p>You are woken at daybreak by the cawing of seagulls and the sound of the pounding waves. The owner of the inn provides you and the marines with a hearty breakfast, after which you say your farewells and take your leave of this sleepy little village by the bay.</p>
<p>You wile away the hours that you spend riding the coast road by recounting some of the many legends of the Kai. The marines are particularly enthralled by your account of the quest for the Lorestones of Nyxator, when Sun Eagle—the first Kai Lord—sought out the legendary seven stones of power so that he could acquire the secrets of the Magnakai Disciplines. At noon you stop to rest your horses and catch some local game called flomi. These rabbit-like creatures are so plentiful in these parts that you have enough food left over for 2 Meals. (If you decide to keep this food, amend your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p>The afternoon ride passes pleasantly without incident or delay, and shortly before sunset you come within sight of the town gates of Khor. It is only now that you see something in the distance which gives you cause for concern.</p>
