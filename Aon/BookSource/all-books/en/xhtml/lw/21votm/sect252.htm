<h3>252</h3>

<p>You are less than fifty yards from the gatehouse when suddenly the dull <i>clang</i> of an iron bell shatters the evening calm of Cape Kabar. The owners of the Barczak Stables have discovered that some of their expensive horses are missing and they have raised the alarm. Through the open gate you glimpse the flicker of torches and your keen ears detect the sound of beating hooves. It is an armed search party and they are following your tracks while they are still fresh.</p>
<p>You call to your companions to stay close as you urge your horse to the gallop. For ten miles you race together along the flat coast road and are able to maintain a safe distance from your pursuers, but when the trail begins to ascend into the hills, the lack of saddles and stirrups begins to exact its toll. Those following behind have no such disadvantage and they close the gap rapidly.</p>
<p>You are ascending a steep slope towards the crest of a moonlit ridge when ahead you see the beginning of a hill track. It forks away from the main road and disappears into the hills to your right.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to steer your horse along this hill track, <a href="sect206.htm">turn to 206</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to stay on the coast road, <a href="sect189.htm">turn to 189</a>.</p>
