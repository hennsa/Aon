<h3>272</h3>

<p>The marines go to their rooms and you are about to retire to yours when the innkeeper notices that you have a musical instrument, part of which is protruding from beneath the flap of your Backpack. He asks if you would be kind enough to play for his customers, but after having paid his son so much for such poor food and lodging at this inn you do not feel inclined to agree to his request. When you refuse he offers you 5 Gold Crowns to change your mind.</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ you say, pocketing the five gold coins. ‘I’ll play them five songs, but no more.’</p>
<p>The villagers listen rapturously to your recital of five popular Sommlending ballads. When you finish they show their appreciation by giving you an additional 2 Gold Crowns. (Unless you already possess the maximum permissible, you may add a total of 7 Gold Crowns to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect8.htm">turn to 8</a>.</p>
