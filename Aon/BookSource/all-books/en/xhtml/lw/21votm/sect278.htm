<h3>278</h3>

<p>The deck of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> becomes a hive of activity as the crew sets about getting the ship ready to sail. When the last spread of canvas has been unfurled and the cables are cast off from the quayside, you feel the deck rock gently as Paoll steers the cargo-heavy vessel towards the entrance to Holmgard harbour. At first she responds sluggishly and the First Mate curses her as he struggles with the ship’s wheel. Yet, once you pass beyond the harbour’s protective walls, a sea wind fills the sails and the ship is swiftly transformed. Within minutes of leaving harbour, <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> is speeding swiftly eastwards through the foam-flecked waters of the Holmgulf.</p>
<p>For six uneventful days you sail across the Gulf of Durenor, the passage made easy by fair weather and a strong following wind. After a night’s anchorage at Port Bax, the voyage continues along the Rymerift and into the warm, turquoise waters of the Kuri Sea. Shortly after dawn of the thirteenth day, an island looms into view on the horizon. Its white sandy beaches and rich vegetation appear innocuous, but Captain Raker informs you that it is one of the notorious Lakuri Isles. For centuries the bays and hidden coves of the Lakuris have provided a safe haven for pirates, the most infamous of whom was Captain Khadro. Six years ago this murderous buccaneer was slain by your master, Lone Wolf, yet despite his demise the Lakuri Islands still harbour renegades and pirates who have set up camp here during the past year. Captain Raker scours the horizon with his telescope, seeking a tell-tale glimpse of sail among the inlets and coves which pepper the shoreline. During his last voyage he came close to losing his ship in these waters and he is understandably wary.</p>
