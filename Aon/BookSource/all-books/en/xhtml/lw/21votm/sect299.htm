<h3>299</h3>

<p>Skilfully you ascend the rigging and approach the giant spider from behind and below. It is busily tearing at the mast and topsail with its fanged maw, and at first it fails to notice you. When you pause for a few moments to unsheathe your weapon, suddenly the creature swivels its head and fixes you with a pair of ghastly green eyes. Chittering excitedly, it rubs its forelegs together and sparks appear, warning you that it is preparing to launch a bolt of energy. Quickly you cut free a trailing rope and swing away from the rigging just in time to avoid being burnt to a cinder when it launches its burst of crackling blue fire. Your swift reflexes save you, but as the momentum of your swing carries you back towards the rigging, you see that the creature is preparing a new form of attack.</p>
<p>It waits until you come to rest upon the criss-cross of ropes and then it ejects a stream of sickly grey fluid from a sac located below its gaping maw. This fluid hardens as it passes through the air, and is transformed into several long and sticky strands which threaten to engulf you.</p>
