<h3>315</h3>

<p>You strike your killing blow and the Otokh emits a loud and terrible shriek. Its great body convulses, and hissing sparks cascade from its limbs and maw as slowly it relinquishes its grip upon the masthead. You watch with awe as the creature plummets through the rigging and crashes down upon the deck rail with terrific force. Five enemy raiders are crushed to death and several more are consigned to a watery grave when they become entangled in the creature’s legs. They are dragged screaming to their doom as the Otokh rolls through the shattered ship’s rail and disappears beneath the foaming waves.</p>
<p>The death of the Otokh sends a wave of panic coursing through the enemy’s ranks and soon they begin to falter and fall back to their own vessel. The enemy leader curses and screams as his men swarm aboard, and you hear him threaten personally to tear the throat from any warrior who refuses to fight on. This threat appears to work for the raiders cease their retreat and begin instead to regroup in preparation for another attack. You watch as the leader leaves the protection of his ship’s forecastle and takes his place at the head of his troops, ready to lead this second assault.</p>
