<h3>316</h3>

<p>You magnify your vision and detect that there are violent thermal air currents swirling between the mountain peaks. You detect that these are the result of the dry air currents from the Bavari Hills meeting with the humid jungle air of the southern reaches. You warn Yranai but he seems unconcerned.</p>
<p>‘It may get a little rough but <cite>Simoom</cite> is built to take it,’ he says with bravado, and he bangs his fist on the handrail that runs around the rim of the basket, as if to demonstrate his craft’s sturdy workmanship. When a section of the handrail immediately falls away and is lost in the mountains below, it does not readily inspire your confidence in this craft or its pilot. Sheepishly, Yranai plays with the valves of the engine and the balloon drifts to the east, towards some more distant but lesser peaks where the air is calmer. He gives you a wry grin and you give thanks to Kai and Ishir that he has heeded your warning.</p>
