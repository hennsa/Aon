<h3>333</h3>

<p>The owner places the items under his counter and then he ushers all four of you to a table. After a few minutes his wife appears carrying four plates, each stacked high with a mound of fresh vegetables and poached fish. While you enjoy this delicious meal, you listen to the marines talking about their homes and families back on Kirlu, their past tours of duty, and their fond memories of Sergeant Dryan. You sense that each man, in his own way, is grieving the loss of this brave young sergeant. Soon their jovial conversation has become tinged with melancholy and homesickness and you become a little worried by their mood of sadness. To raise their morale you ask the owner to bring them each a measure of his finest brew. Gladly he accepts your order and pours each man a flagon of strong dark ale. This proves most effective in curing their melancholy for it is so strong that it renders all three of them unconscious! With the owner’s help you carry the marines to their beds and then return to enjoy a small glass of ale in his company.</p>
<p>A little while later an old woman enters the inn clutching a basket filled with bones, dice, and other fortune-telling paraphernalia. She offers to tell you the secrets of your future in return for 1 Gold Crown.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accept the old woman’s offer, <a href="sect69.htm">turn to 69</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to decline her offer, you can retire for the night by <a href="sect242.htm">turning to 242</a>.</p>
