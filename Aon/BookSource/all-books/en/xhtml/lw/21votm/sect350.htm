<h3>350</h3>

<p>It is dusk when at last you reach the wondrous city of Elzian. It is a magical metropolis that sparkles like a fiery crimson jewel in the last rays of the setting sun. You pass through its broad outer wall and cross the canal which encircles its tallest edifice—the Tower of Truth. As you approach a vast gatehouse, the portcullis rises and a troop of Vakeros guards rush forward to greet you. They have been keeping watch for your arrival for many days and had all but given up hope that you would appear. They escort you swiftly into the tower’s vaulted council chamber where you are received by Lord Rimoah and the illustrious members of the High Council of the Elder Magi. The grand chamber is cleared of all but the most senior council members and a gasp of reverence fills its echoing reaches when, at Lord Rimoah’s request, you open your satchel and reveal the Moonstone to their learned eyes. Rimoah requests that you recount the details of your journey here and, when you have finished, he and his kinsmen praise you warmly for the greatness of your achievement.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. You have proved your courage and resourcefulness. Lone Wolf was right to entrust the task of returning the Moonstone to you. You are a credit to your homeland and your noble order. You have completed the task set by your Supreme Master and you have triumphed in the face of great adversity.</p>
<p>However, your mission is not yet fully completed. The second and most challenging part of your journey awaits, a journey that will take you deep into the wild and lawless reaches of Southern Magnamund where no Kai has ever ventured before. If you truly possess the courage to return the Moonstone to the Isle of Lorn, then your quest continues in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure entitled:</p>
