<h3>36</h3>

<p>You turn and sprint back along the street, but you have taken only a few paces when you hear a Vakeros shout a single, thunderous word: <i>Gloar!</i></p>
<p>A concussive blast of air hits you in the middle of your back and sends you tumbling forwards to crash face-first to the ground. You strike your head on the cobblestones and badly bruise your shoulder as you somersault into the base of a street lantern-post: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>You have been struck by the effects of the Old Kingdom Spell <i>Power Word</i>. Painfully you stagger to your feet and see that the Vakeros have moved forward to surround you. As they close in, you notice that their spears are held out at arm’s length as if they are afraid to come too close. Their officer, a young lieutenant, steps a pace nearer and you see that he is sweating profusely. It is a warm night but this is not the reason he is perspiring: he is terrified. Then he recognizes the style of your tunic, and when he looks carefully at your face you see the whipcord tension in his body begin to ease a little.</p>
<p>‘You’re a Kai?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ you reply. ‘I’m a journeyman bound for Elzian.’</p>
<p>The Vakeros signals to his men and expertly they couch their spears and form a column in readiness to march.</p>
<p>‘Well, Master Kai,’ says the lieutenant, ‘you had better come with us.’</p>
