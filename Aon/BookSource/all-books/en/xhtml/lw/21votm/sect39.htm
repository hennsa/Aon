<h3>39</h3>

<p>The evil that lingers around this chamber makes your skin crawl and you decide to stay here not a moment longer. You and Oriah climb the stone steps and return to the marines who are now hiding among the boulders at the edge of the plateau. Ernan tells you that during your absence he has watched the riders pass by the entrance to the hill track and continue along the coast road for several miles. Just a few minutes before you arrived, these same riders came galloping back along the road towards Cape Kabar. He is convinced that they have called off the chase and have decided to return to their town.</p>
<p>Now that the threat appears to have passed, you and your travelling companions remount your horses and leave this plateau.</p>
