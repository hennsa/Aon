<h3>64</h3>

<p>‘He’s right,’ says the rogue, and sheepishly he backs away from your table.</p>
<p>‘He can’t be the creature,’ whispers one of the other men. ‘It wouldn’t know the answer.’</p>
<p>Confused and angered by their actions, and by what they are saying, you rise from your seat and demand an explanation. The innkeeper hurries over with a tankard of ale in his hand. He and the men apologize for the frosty reception you have received since you entered the tavern, and the innkeeper offers you the ale, free of charge, as if to make amends for their behaviour.</p>
<p>‘I don’t want your ale,’ you snap. ‘What I want is an explanation. What’s really going on here?’</p>
<p>The innkeeper looks at you and there is fear behind his eyes. ‘Very well,’ he says, ‘I’ll tell you. It’s only right that you should know.’</p>
