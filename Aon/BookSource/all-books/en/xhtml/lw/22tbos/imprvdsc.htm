<h3>Improved Grand Master Disciplines</h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Grand Mastery you will find that your Disciplines will steadily improve.</p>
<h4><a name="superior">Kai Grand Master Superior</a></h4>

<p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Assimilance</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy’s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Astrology</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Herbmastery</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two pints of water per day can be purified using this skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Elementalism</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of one large bucketful of fresh water.<br /><br />
</dd>
<dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
<dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to utilize their musical skills to pacify an excited or hostile animal.<br /><br />
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of additional improvements and how they affect your existing Grand Master Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Grand Master Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> books.</p>
