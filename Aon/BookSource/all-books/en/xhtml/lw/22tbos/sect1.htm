<h3>1</h3>

<p>For three days you are treated to the lavish hospitality of the Elder Magi and the freedom of the wondrous city of Elzian. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, having fully recovered from the rigours of your journey to Dessi, you meet with Lord Rimoah in the Tower of Truth to discuss the final stage of your quest—the voyage to the Isle of Lorn. He informs you that passage has been arranged for you aboard a Suhnese trading ship called <cite>The Azan</cite> which sails tomorrow at dawn. The ship’s master, Captain Jenkshi, has been paid generously to carry you to his home port of Suhn, and you can expect to be well treated by him and his crew. It will be a long voyage, some 2,500 miles in all, but not all of it will be spent at sea. <cite>The Azan</cite> will put in at several ports along the way, both to trade and to take on fresh supplies of food and water. Rimoah reminds you of the need for secrecy—nobody must know the real purpose of your journey. Jenkshi and his men have been told that you are simply a courier who is carrying official papers for the attention of Lord Zinair, the Dessian ambassador to Suhn. On arriving at Suhn you are to contact Lord Zinair who will arrange for your passage across the Sea of Dreams to the Isle of Lorn. Before you leave the Tower of Truth and return to your chambers, Lord Rimoah examines the satchel in which you carry the Moonstone. Its special korlinium lining meets with his approval.</p>

<p>‘Lone Wolf has prepared you well for your mission,’ he says, as he secures the buckle. ‘I’m sure I have no need to remind you to keep this bag closed at all times. You are about to venture through dangerous territory, and there are many who would give anything to possess the contents of this satchel. You would be wise to trust only yourself, Grand Master.’ (If you have not already done so, record the Moonstone on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You carry it slung over your shoulder in its leather satchel.)</p>
<p>Rimoah escorts you to your room and tells you that he will call for you at an hour before dawn to take you to the quay. As he bids you goodnight, a doleful bell rings out in some distant part of the city. Rimoah’s eyes fill with sadness.</p>
<p>‘What does the bell mean, my lord?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘It signifies the passing of Lord Casis. He, too, is about to begin a journey. Alas, it will be his last. I must go now—I am being summoned to witness his departure.’</p>
<p>As he leaves, Rimoah pauses for a moment and then glances back over his shoulder. ‘You are welcome to accompany me if you wish, Grand Master. The passing of an Elder is a rare and special occasion. You may learn much from what you see.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accept Lord Rimoah’s invitation, <a href="sect225.htm">turn to 225</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to decline his invitation, <a href="sect118.htm">turn to 118</a>.</p>
