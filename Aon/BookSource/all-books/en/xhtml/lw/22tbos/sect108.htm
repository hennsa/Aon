<h3>108</h3>

<p>You pat your Belt Pouch to make the coins inside jingle, and then you tell the innkeeper that you want to buy your companions a drink.</p>
<p>‘What’s wrong wiv’ you? Ya hard o’hearin’? I said get out and I meant get out!’ And with these harsh words the innkeeper flashes a glance at a group of mean-faced men who are standing along the counter. They put down their ales and then move slowly towards you, their hands hovering menacingly around the hilts of their swords and daggers. For a few anxious moments it looks as if a fight is about to break out, but then a gruff voice arises from the corner of the taproom and the men halt in their tracks.</p>
<p>‘Hold y’horses,’ says the commanding voice. ‘Let me speak with the Northlander.’</p>
<p>You peer across the smoky room and see that the voice belongs to a stout, bearded man who is sitting alone in an alcove. He beckons you to join him, but when you approach his table in the company of the Suhnese crewmen he suddenly snaps at you: ‘I said I wanted to speak to you, not these raggin’ crows. If you want to do business with me, they’ll have to wait for you in the street outside.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to agree to his terms, <a href="sect164.htm">turn to 164</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you refuse to part company with the Suhnese, <a href="sect121.htm">turn to 121</a>.</p>
