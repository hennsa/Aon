<h3>113</h3>

<p>Radyard is clearly impressed by your act of selflessness and he thanks you. He orders his crew to hoist the sails, and he tells his bo’sun to wave a white flag from the stern deck to signal to Sesketera that he is complying with his command. A longboat is launched from <cite>The Triasus</cite> to collect you. It is carrying an officer and six marines, each armed with a half-pike and a Bor pistol. You present yourself to the officer and he ties your hands with cord before placing you aboard the boat. Radyard and his crew watch grim-faced as the longboat pushes off and begins its return run. Four of the marines are rowing whilst the officer and the other two watch you closely, the tips of their shortened naval pikes never wandering far from the vicinity of your heart. You turn to look to the jungle shore, less than half a mile distant, and suddenly a bold plan springs into your mind.</p>
