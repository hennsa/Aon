<h3>117</h3>

<p>You dismount from your mule and hurry into the village. The fiercest fire is raging through the roof of the largest hut which dominates the centre of the settlement, and it is here that you use your Kai skill to best effect. You suppress the flames, shrinking them and containing them so that the villagers are able to approach with buckets of water and put out the blaze.</p>
<p>When all of the smaller fires in the surrounding huts have also been extinguished, the elder of the village thanks you for your timely help. He tells you that the fire was started deliberately by a dragon that dwells in the Hulhuk Mountains.</p>
<p>‘It is the bane of our humble village,’ he says, shaking his head sadly. ‘We fear that it will return this night to finish us.’ Seeing the Kai Weapon sheathed at your side, the elder looks at you with hope in his eyes. He begs you to stay here tonight and help rid the village of its bane.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stay and help the villagers, <a href="sect267.htm">turn to 267</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide not to help them, <a href="sect213.htm">turn to 213</a>.</p>
