<h3>136</h3>

<p>Fearing that Hiojin will carry out his threat, in desperation you make one last attempt to reason with the man.</p>
<p>‘If I were an assassin, do you really think that I would ask the City Guard for directions to my victim’s house?’</p>
<p>Hiojin frowns. He is beginning to have doubts about his assumption that you are a hired killer. Rather than admit that he could be wrong he begins to bluster:</p>
<p>‘Er, I’ll have to look into this further. In the meantime you will be held here pending … er, further investigations.’</p>
<p>Hiojin quickly summons his men and has you taken away and placed in a solitary cell.</p>
