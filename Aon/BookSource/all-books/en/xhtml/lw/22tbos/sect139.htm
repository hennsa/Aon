<h3>139</h3>

<p>On returning to Grooja’s hut, you find Tolshi waiting there for you. He asks you to accompany him to the ship at once for the captain needs you to help with the repairs. It is as if your silent prayers for rescue have been answered. You thank the elder for the visit to the oracle, and his wife for her hospitality, and then you leave quickly with the helmsman.</p>
<p>‘The captain doesn’t really need your help,’ confides a grinning Tolshi, as you make your way hurriedly through the hovels of Dlash-da Ralzuha towards its torchlit harbour. ‘He just thought you’d welcome an excuse for not having to stay all night at Grooja’s flea-ridden shack!’</p>
<p>On your return to the ship you thank the captain for sending Tolshi to rescue you, and to show your appreciation, you help the crew to patch the damaged hull. By first light the repairs have been completed and the cargo is then reloaded into the hold. Jenkshi gives Grooja and the natives some copper ingots as payment for their help, and then the crew cast off and catch the morning tide.</p>
<p>For two days <cite>The Azan</cite> hugs the coastline as it sails a southerly course to Ghol-Tabras. The weather is kind and the ship makes good progress, enabling you to enter port shortly before dusk.</p>
