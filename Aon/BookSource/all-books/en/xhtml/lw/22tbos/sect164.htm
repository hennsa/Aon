<h3>164</h3>

<p>You apologize to your companions and ask them to wait for you outside the tavern. Meekly they agree, and as they file out of the door, you assure them that you will not keep them waiting too long. You then sit opposite the bearded man and soon discover that he is a merchant captain from Lunarlia. He is interested in buying copper but he will only offer you 4 Nobles for an ingot. It is a poor price and you tell him that you will have to speak with Captain Jenkshi before you can agree to his bid.</p>
<p>As you rise from your seat he tells you to wait a moment. Copper is not the only thing that he buys. He offers to pay you 8 Nobles for any Special Item you possess (excluding the Moonstone which is not for sale), 2 Nobles for any Weapon, and 1 Noble for any Backpack Item. If you wish to raise some money for yourself by selling items of equipment to this man, do so now and adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>You bid the merchant goodnight and he acknowledges the pleasantry with a snake-like blink of his eyes. As you go he calls out to remind you that he can be found here in the morning should Jenkshi decide to sell his copper ingots for 4 Nobles each.</p>
