<h3>18</h3>

<p>You apologize to your companions and ask them to wait for you outside the hall’s double doors. Meekly the Suhnese agree, and as they file out of the hall you assure them that they will not have to wait too long. You then accompany the guildsman to his chambers where he attempts to drive a hard bargain for the copper. He offers you 6 Nobles for each ingot and says that it is his best and final price. It is not a very good price and you tell him that you will have to speak with Jenkshi before you can agree to his offer.</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ he says. ‘I’m sure your captain is a reasonable man. I feel confident we’ll do business.’</p>
<p>From an ornate cabinet he removes a decanter and two long-stemmed glasses. He then pours two glasses of liqueur and offers one of them to you.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Grand Pathsmanship, <a href="sect72.htm">turn to 72</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, <a href="sect324.htm">turn to 324</a>.</p>
