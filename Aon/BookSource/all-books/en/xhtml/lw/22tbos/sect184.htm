<h3>184</h3>

<p>Fair weather returns and <cite>The Azan</cite> makes good speed as it crosses the jade-green waters of the Gulf of Tentarium. It is shortly before noon of the following day when the first glimpse of Zharloum is sighted by the lookout, and less than an hour later you find yourself sailing into the harbour of this grand city. Emerald pennants flutter from the towers and roofs of its sun-bleached houses, and crowds of industrious citizens throng its paved avenues and alleyways. This old Shadakine port has a long history of free and fair trading. It is many miles from the cities of Shadakine political power which lie to the south and, due to this fortunate fact, it has been spared much of the damage wrought upon this troubled land by a succession of ruthless and tyrannical rulers.</p>
<p>The ship enters and docks at the harbour wall, close to the jetty of a warehouse which contains the iron and copper ingots that it will carry to Suhn. As the crew begin the task of loading the cargo aboard, you decide to go and explore this thriving city. But after little more than an hour the heat, hustle, and noise of the crowded streets becomes oppressive and you find yourself yearning for somewhere quiet to rest before you return to the ship. Looking around, you notice two places which offer the promise of some respite from the teeming crowds. The first is a public park which stands upon a cliff that looms above the city to the east of the harbour wall. The second is a narrow, deserted alley that wends its way into the city’s Old Quarter.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to visit the park, <a href="sect291.htm">turn to 291</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to explore the city’s Old Quarter, <a href="sect126.htm">turn to 126</a>.</p>
