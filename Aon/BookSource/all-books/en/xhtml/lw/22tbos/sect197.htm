<h3>197</h3>

<p>During the journey to Tiklu you learn much from Tzai—your talkative companion. He tells you tales about the local history of this region, its ancient legends and heroes, and about the dark days not so long ago when it was ruled by Shasarak, the infamous Wytch-king of Shadaki.</p>
<p>The journey passes swiftly in his good company and you arrive at Tiklu during the afternoon. It is a bustling port which stands at the edge of the Sea of Winds, and is second only in size and importance to the City of Shadaki itself. Tzai is welcomed by the guards on watch at the gate who wave as you pass beneath its mighty arch. It is clear from their reaction that your companion is a popular man. As you travel along a paved avenue towards the heart of Tiklu, Tzai asks where you are going to stay during your visit. When you cannot readily answer his question, he invites you to stay at his house tonight. Gratefully you accept his generous invitation.</p>
