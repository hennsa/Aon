<h3>206</h3>

<p>You make a quick search of the dead henchmen and discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 Swords</li>
<li>3 Daggers</li>
<li>8 Nobles</li>
</ul>
<p>Melchar helps you to hide their bodies before you leave the tackroom. Outside, you discover that the race has ended and that the favourite, Forlu-zhan, came in last. The crowds are bitterly disappointed with the result, but Wrok the Bookmaker is beaming with joy, for he and his conspirators have made a fortune by sabotaging the favourite guanza. He begins to wonder why his henchmen have not returned and, when he looks to the tackroom door, he catches sight of you and Melchar leaving. Frantically he signals to his conspirators to stop you getting away. You see them closing in and you grab Melchar by the arm for fear of losing him among the crowds that are heading for the exit gates.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to leave the racetrack by the main exit, <a href="sect179.htm">turn to 179</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to leave by a side gate, <a href="sect347.htm">turn to 347</a>.</p>
