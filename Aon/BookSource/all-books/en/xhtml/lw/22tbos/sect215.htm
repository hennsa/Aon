<h3>215</h3>

<p>Your second blow has gashed Sesketera’s face. It is a minor wound but it is enough to make him break off the combat. He staggers backwards, clutching at his injured cheek with his left hand, and you see blood begin to trickle through his fingers. Then there is a noise over on the far side of the balcony and moments later three citadel guards come rushing through the open archway.</p>
<p>‘Kill him!’ shouts Sesketera, and he presses himself flat to the wall so that they are able to get to you. Looking down into the hall you can see that the main doors are still unguarded despite the incessant ringing of the alarm bell. Fearing that your only route of escape may soon be sealed off, you sheathe your weapon and leap over the parapet.</p>
