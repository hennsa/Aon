<h3>218</h3>

<p>You throw yourself to the deck and take cover behind the wooden parapet of the prow as the enemy’s shot rips into the sails and rigging. Shredded canvas and splintered timbers fall about your ears, yet you survive this ferocious bombardment without sustaining the slightest injury. Bravely Captain Jenkshi takes over the helm and steers his battered ship relentlessly towards the channel. You see him cursing the enemy captain and shaking his fist defiantly at the villainous Shadakine gunners as their cannonballs whistle across the decks of <cite>The Azan</cite>. Then a gust of wind fills the torn mainsail and the ship begins to pull away from the lumbering man o’war. A second broadside falls wide of its mark, and Jenkshi’s bold plan finally pays off when the enemy ship is forced to veer away for fear of beaching her hull in the shallows. The crew cheer loudly when they see her red sails falling away to the stern, and <cite>The Azan</cite> is left alone to make a swift passage through the islet channel.</p>
<p>You pull yourself unsteadily to your feet and make your way along the debris-strewn deck to congratulate Jenkshi for his masterful display of seamanship. He accepts your praise and the cheers of his crew with a rueful smile, even though his skill and his coolness under enemy fire have undoubtedly saved the ship and the lives of all aboard. However, as the ship emerges on the far side of the islets, you soon discover that more than just Jenkshi’s bravery will be needed if everyone aboard <cite>The Azan</cite> is to live to tell the tale of their deadly encounter with the buccaneers of Shadaki.</p>
