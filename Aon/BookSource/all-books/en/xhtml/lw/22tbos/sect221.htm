<h3>221</h3>

<p>The City Guard patrol confiscates your Weapons (including your Kai Weapon) and marches you out of the square under close escort. You are taken to a black-stoned citadel called the Hall of Correction, a dour building that was constructed by order of Mother Magri—the former Steward of Suhn—during the reign of the hated Wytch-king Shasarak.</p>
<p>You are brought before a pompous Guard Officer called Hiojin who refuses to believe that you are a messenger from Elzian here to meet with Lord Zinair. He believes you are a hired assassin.</p>
<p>‘These are troubled times. There are men abroad who would seek to harm Lord Zinair. I cannot allow this. It is my duty to protect the ambassadors to our great city.’</p>
<p>When you steadfastly refuse to change your story, the officer scratches his pock-marked chin and narrows his beady eyes.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps you have some proof that what you say is true?’ he says, as he stares at your satchel.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy, <a href="sect279.htm">turn to 279</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this Grand Master Discipline, <a href="sect163.htm">turn to 163</a>.</p>
