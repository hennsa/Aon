<h3>265</h3>

<p>The gaol of Ghol-Tabras was once the southern wing of a grand citadel built by Jublazh Khyr, the first emperor of Shadaki. Its cells are reputed to be among the most escape-proof of any in Southern Magnamund, especially those which are located below ground level in the dungeons of the old citadel. Upon arriving at the gaol, you and your companions are thrown into a communal cell on the second floor. However, as soon as the gaolers examine the Kai Weapon and equipment that they confiscated from you, they begin to think that perhaps you are something more than just a hapless curfew-breaker.</p>
<p>An hour after you arrive, the door of the communal cell bangs open and six armed citadel guards burst in. They have come to take you away from the Suhnese and transfer you to a separate cell below ground level. Your destination turns out to be a damp, windowless chamber. It opens onto a torchlit corridor that is lined with rusting stands of armour. At the end of the corridor is a guardroom and, when you pass by this room on your way to the cell, you catch a glimpse of the wooden crate which contains your Weapons and equipment. It is being stored here. You are pushed into your dingy cell, and then the iron door is slammed shut and bolted. As you listen to the footsteps of the guards receding down the corridor, you vow that you will escape from this gaol before the night is over.</p>
