<h3>267</h3>

<p>The elder spreads the news to his people that you have agreed to help them and they cheer you loudly. The women of the village bring you food and wine (restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points), and the children make it their duty to see that your mule is watered and fed.</p>
<p>At sunset, you follow the elder and a dozen of the village men to a rocky outcrop which overlooks the settlement. They have prepared several hiding places among the rocks where they can lie in wait for the dragon. They are armed with spears and bows, and you note that they have a plentiful supply of arrows. You take cover with the elder and wait patiently for the dragon to arrive. You do not have to wait very long. In the fading light of dusk you see the creature come gliding down from the mountains. The elder tells his men to ready their bows and, as they carry out his order, you see him smile. He seems to be relishing the thought of avenging the damage this creature has caused. The dragon circles above the village and then comes swooping over the outcrop. It is now within arrow range.</p>
