<h3>268</h3>

<p>Once everyone is safely back aboard <cite>The Azan</cite>, you inform Captain Jenkshi of what happened at the Three Capstans Inn. With a resigned expression on his weather-beaten face, he listens to your report and then thanks you for the part you played in saving his crew from further injury or death. He tells you that similar incidents have happened many times before, in ports all over Magnamund, and he is resigned to the fact that they will happen again sometime in the future. Eldenorans are infamous for their bigotry and intolerance; Jenkshi is just glad that this time his crew had the good fortune to have you looking after their interests.</p>
<p>Before you and the crew retire to your cabins to sleep, the captain takes the precaution of posting extra watchmen on deck, just in case the Eldenorans should come looking for trouble during the night.</p>
