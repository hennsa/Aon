<h3>271</h3>

<p>You take the glass and sip the cherry-coloured liqueur. It has a delicious flavour and you commend the guildsman for his good taste. The man is greatly flattered, so much so that he offers you a bottle of this fine Scava liqueur. (If you wish to accept his offer, record this Bottle of Scava on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.)</p>
<p>You then bid the guildsman good evening and promise that you will return tomorrow morning to conclude your business. On leaving the hall you rejoin the Suhnese and hurry with them through the flagstoned streets of the city, retracing your route back to the harbour in the hope of reaching <cite>The Azan</cite> before night closes in completely. You are within a few hundred yards of the harbour entrance when suddenly a patrol of the city watch come marching around a corner with their spears couched on their chainmailed shoulders. Their officer commands you all to halt and demands that you raise your hands above your heads.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to do as the officer has ordered, <a href="sect228.htm">turn to 228</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to make a dash for the harbour, <a href="sect330.htm">turn to 330</a>.</p>
