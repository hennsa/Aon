<h3>290</h3>

<p>For two days you follow this shoreline which borders upon the Sea of Dreams. You feed upon the plentiful supply of marine life that you find at low tide in rockpools and caves, and you avoid the natives of the coastal villages through which you take care to pass only at night.</p>
<p>During the morning of the third day you catch your first sighting of the Port of Suhn and your spirits rise. It sits upon an islet at the mouth of the River Azan, and it is a most welcoming sight. There have been many times during your long voyage south that you feared you might not live to ever see this city.</p>
<p>You continue your trek and enter Suhn by means of a grand wooden bridge. It spans the Azan and leads directly to the harbour. You stop to admire the great harbour gate of Suhn. It is a magnificent arch that is decorated with likenesses of the heads of every ruler this city has known. You count 120 heads in all, the last in the line being that of the city’s present ruler—Grey Star. The harbour is filled with low, wide boats, many with makeshift shelters, that rock gently on the tide. Native families crowd these vessels, their menfolk working long hours at the busy quayside and trading wharves nearby. Passing through the harbour you see several patrols of City Guardsmen who are heavily armed and quick to stop anyone they consider to be suspicious. There is an underlying sense of unease about the place, a tension that reminds you of Nhang. You decide it would be wise to avoid the City Guards and so you leave the harbour and go in search of Lord Zinair, the Dessian ambassador. Beyond the harbour gate you see that there are only two thoroughfares. One leads directly to Suhn’s Market Square and the other, the Avenue of the Southern Seas, wends its way into the city’s trade quarter.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to follow the street that leads to the Market Square, <a href="sect116.htm">turn to 116</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to enter the Avenue of the Southern Seas, <a href="sect194.htm">turn to 194</a>.</p>
