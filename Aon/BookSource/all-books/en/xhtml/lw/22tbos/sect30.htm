<h3>30</h3>

<p>You push open the swing doors and enter a crowded taproom. Never have you seen so many different types of people and faces together in one place before, and it takes you a few moments to get over your initial surprise. Nobody pays you a second glance as you push your way through this exotic crowd of traders and travellers and make your way to the counter.</p>
<p>When you find the landlord you ask if he knows or has heard of Captain Radyard. The man laughs like a drain and nods his head enthusiastically.</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes, oh yes … Radyard. Him and his men stay here two nights ago. Fine men … good drinkers … fine fellows. They come here always when in Masama.’</p>
<p>The landlord goes on to say that he has not seen them since. He suggests that you ask at the Masama Warehouse. It is the place where they usually sell their cargo. You thank the landlord and turn to leave. As you reach the exit, you are tapped on the shoulder by a weasel-faced man who begs for a moment of your time.</p>
<p>‘Excuse me, sir,’ he says, ‘but I overheard you asking for Captain Radyard. I know the captain and I can take you to him. Only … well, I’ve a great thirst and I’m in sore need of some ale. Perhaps you would buy me an ale? Then I’d gladly take you to the captain.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to buy the man an ale, <a href="sect264.htm">turn to 264</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="sect83.htm">turn to 83</a>.</p>
