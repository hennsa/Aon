<h3>308</h3>

<p>Night has fallen since you were first imprisoned in the hut and you are able to use the cover of darkness to avoid being seen. You are anxious to escape from this place but you are not prepared to leave without first retrieving the Moonstone, your Weapons, and your confiscated equipment.</p>
<p>You allow your Kai Sixth Sense to guide you to where your Kai Weapon is being stored. It is a large wooden shack at the centre of the settlement, and it is occupied by the village elders. Soon the news of your disappearance prompts the leader to order a search. You stay hidden until the shack is empty and the coast is clear, and then you enter it by means of an open window. Inside you discover all of your confiscated equipment, as well as several other items which could prove useful during your quest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>6 Arrows</li>
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Rope</li>
<li>3 Fish Hooks</li>
<li>Bottle of Rice Wine</li>
<li>Soap</li>
<li>Short Sword</li>
<li>Lantern</li>
<li>Crystal Prism (Special Item)</li>
</ul>
<p>Having restored your equipment, you leave the shack and make your way into the jungle. Your Kai skills enable you to avoid the villagers and make a swift escape westwards into the hills.</p>
