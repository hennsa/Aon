<h3>31</h3>

<p>You grab the sides of the ladder and climb towards the hatch. The rungs are slippery and the slick leather of your soles does not make for a speedy ascent. Then you hear a loud hissing and you look down to see that the creature is directly below you. Suddenly the ladder lurches violently as the ship is struck by another wave. There is a loud roar, and then the hatch above your head collapses and you are hit by a deluge of seawater that sweeps you off the ladder. You crash down upon the creature’s head, stunning it, and the force of your fall sends it reeling to the floor.</p>
<p>Frantically you scramble to your feet and reach for your Kai Weapon to finish the beast before it can recover. But to your horror you discover that your weapon is not at your side; it fell from your belt when you were swept off the ladder. You look around and catch sight of it sliding across the floor towards the bulkhead door.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to retrieve your Kai Weapon, <a href="sect227.htm">turn to 227</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to attack the beast with a normal Weapon before it fully recovers, <a href="sect176.htm">turn to 176</a>.</p>
