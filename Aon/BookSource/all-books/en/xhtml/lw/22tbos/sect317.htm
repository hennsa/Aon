<h3>317</h3>

<p>Your Arrow glances off the blade of Sesketera’s spear and gashes his face. It is not a serious wound but it makes him drop his weapon and stagger backwards. He is clutching at his injured cheek with both hands and you can see blood is beginning to trickle freely through his fingers. Then you hear a noise over on the far side of the balcony and moments later three citadel guards come rushing through the open archway.</p>
<p>‘Kill him!’ shouts Sesketera, and he presses himself flat to the wall so that they are able to get to you. Looking down into the hall you note that the main doors are still unguarded despite the incessant ringing of the alarm bell. Fearing that your only route of escape may soon be sealed off, you shoulder your Bow and leap boldly over the parapet.</p>
