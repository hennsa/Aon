<h3>319</h3>

<p>Guided by your companions, you make your way through the darkening streets of Ghol-Tabras and arrive at the entrance to the Flying Fish Tavern. The inn is filled with the captains and crews of many of the vessels that are moored down in the harbour. They are a raucous crowd, yet their noise quietens to barely a whisper the moment you and your companions step through the door.</p>
<p>Slowly you approach the bar, trying your best to ignore the dark mutterings that are passing among the hard-faced sailors. The innkeeper glares at you. It is as if he is daring you to ask him for service. You swallow hard and ask if he knows of anyone who would be interested in buying some copper.</p>
<p>‘Hey, listen up,’ he shouts to the others. ‘This infidel wants to sell some copper!’</p>
<p>The crowded inn erupts with laughter. Now grinning inanely, the innkeeper fixes you with his piggy eyes and asks: ‘An’ just what is it you’ve got to sell then, eh? Your father’s old spit-pot maybe? Bah! Begone, y’scabs. We don’t serve the likes o’you no more. I’m the new owner of this fine establishment and we don’t want your kind here!’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to buy some ale in the hope that it will appease this boorish innkeeper, <a href="sect108.htm">turn to 108</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide that you are wasting precious time here, you can leave the inn by <a href="sect249.htm">turning to 249</a>.</p>
