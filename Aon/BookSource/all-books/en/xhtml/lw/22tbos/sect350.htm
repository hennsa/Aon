<h3>350</h3>

<p>The Shianti escort you from the beach to a wondrous edifice—the sacred Temple of Amida—which stands upon a high spur of rock commanding a spectacular view of the four corners of their magical isle. Here in a formal ceremony you receive the thanks and praise of Acarya—the leader of the Shianti exiles. Solemnly he vows to deliver the Moonstone into the hands of Goddess Ishir herself, thereby ensuring that never again will its powers disrupt Magnamund’s delicate balance of nature, nor be misused by the forces of Evil.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the Shianti show you some of the magical wonders of their island that have never before been seen by Man. You marvel at flowing rivers of jewels, fabulous flora, and species of exotic fauna that defy description. After your tour of this paradise isle you are allowed to rest awhile before you are escorted to your boat to begin your journey back to the Port of Suhn.</p>
<p>Your return voyage across the Sea of Dreams is swift and eerily smooth. You sense that your direction and speed are being controlled by the Shianti, for within minutes of casting off from the shores of Lorn, the bustling harbour entrance to the Port of Suhn suddenly appears from out of the swirling sea mist. A stiff breeze catches your sail and propels you towards the quayside where, to your astonishment, Lord Zinair is waiting to greet your valiant return.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. Once more you have proved your courage and resourcefulness. You have completed the quest entrusted to you by Lone Wolf and you have triumphed magnificently. The safe return of the Moonstone to the Shianti is a major victory in the war against Evil, but it is a war that is still yet to be won. Upon your return to the Port of Suhn you learn from Lord Zinair of a new and sinister threat to the fragile peace of your world. If you wish to confront this deadly threat and prove that you are truly a champion of the New Order Kai, then the nature of the challenge can be found in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure, entitled:</p>
