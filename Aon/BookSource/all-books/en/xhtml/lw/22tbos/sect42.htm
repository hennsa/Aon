<h3>42</h3>

<p>The barman is reluctant to talk. You suspect the reason for this is because you have not had the courtesy to purchase some of his food and ale. When you repeat your question he replies curtly:</p>
<p>‘Lord Zinair of Dessi, you say. Yeah, I think I’ve heard of him. Lives in the North Quarter some place. Don’t know exactly. You’d be best asking the City Guards. They’ll be sure to sort you right.’</p>
<p>You thank the man for his advice and then you leave the tavern and continue along the avenue. At length you arrive at a busy market square. On the far side of this square you see a City Guard patrol who are policing the market.</p>
<p>Remembering the barman’s advice, you decide to approach them and ask for their assistance. You are confident that they will know where Lord Zinair can be found.</p>
