<h3>47</h3>

<p>You utter the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <i>Invisible Fist</i> and project your hand at the creature’s head. The force of your spell makes the beast stumble, but it quickly recovers its footing.</p>
<p>Angered by the pain you have dealt it, the creature turns its ghastly stare on you and hisses vehemently. Quickly you reach to your Kai Weapon in readiness to defend yourself from its attack. Yet it does not attack you; it continues to stalk its chosen target. Gemulkin frees himself from the wheel, but before he can get away, the beast is upon him like a hungry lion. It grabs him by the throat and lifts him off the deck. You race across the slippery decking and raise your weapon to strike the creature in the side. Callously the beast hurls Gemulkin into the sea and then spins around to face you. Your first blow opens a wound in its chest, making it shriek loudly. But it recovers and it lashes out at you to connect with your shoulder. The force of the blow knocks you sideways and sends you sliding across the slick deck to fall headlong through an open cargo hatch.</p>
