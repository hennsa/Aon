<h3>56</h3>

<p>You swallow your pride and politely you ask the captain to release the crewman. Your request is met by a torrent of shouts and coarse laughter from the drunken Eldenorans, yet the captain does as you ask; he releases his grip and lets the gasping crewman drop in a heap to the taproom floor. You motion to the others that the time has come to leave. Without a word they abandon their tables and move towards the door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade as they go. With the threats and crude curses of the Eldenorans ringing in your ears, you walk away from the Three Capstans Inn and return to the harbour. The crew feel angry and frustrated by what has happened, yet they also know that your cool-headed intervention probably saved them from far worse treatment at the hands of the brutish Eldenorans, and for that they are grateful.</p>
