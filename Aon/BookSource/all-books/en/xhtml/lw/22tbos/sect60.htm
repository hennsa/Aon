<h3>60</h3>

<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that, despite his threats, the bandit has no intention of chopping through the rope which anchors the bridge. To do so would lose him your horse, and horses are worth a great many Nobles in this region of Shadaki.</p>
<p>However, you decide to play along with their game. You raise your hands to give the impression that you are surrendering, and when they order you to return across the bridge, you pretend you do not understand. The axeman shouts to his accomplice who is hidden in the crevice. He tells him to stop pulling on the rope and he dutifully obeys. As the bridge ceases to sway, the axeman and one other walk across the bridge towards you. They stop just beyond sword reach and motion to you to lay down your Weapons and equipment. Slowly you lift the satchel off your shoulder. As the strap clears your head, you grip it tightly and take a swing at the axeman. The satchel catches him on the jaw and the weight of the Moonstone knocks him unconscious. His companion screams with anger and lunges at you with his sword, but you swiftly sidestep him and he loses his balance. With a fearful cry on his lips he falls over the side of the bridge and tumbles to his doom.</p>
<p>Quickly you remount your horse and coax him across to the far side. Angry voices echo from the gorge behind you as you spur him to the gallop and escape along the jungle trail beyond the bridge.</p>
