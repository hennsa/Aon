<h3>85</h3>

<p>You magnify your vision and focus on the tangle of burnt timber and ash that lies heaped inside the ruined hut. You are unable to see anything clearly, but you sense that there is something lying buried there. You tell the elder of your discovery and you see a flicker of fear in his old eyes. He says that there is nothing in the hut that could be of interest to the dragon, but your senses tell you otherwise. They also tell you that he is lying.</p>
<p>A group of villagers armed with long spears rush to the hut and attempt to stab the dragon. The creature roars at them and then flaps its leathery wings and begins to circle around the settlement once more. You slip away from your hiding place and hurry down to the ruins for you are determined to discover what it is that the dragon is seeking. Guided by your Sixth Sense, you uncover a bronze statuette from beneath the ashes. Then the dragon returns. It lashes out at the villagers with its clawed forelimbs and smashes their spears to matchwood. The men retreat in confusion and the dragon lands and settles itself beside the hut. You move to unsheathe your weapon but you freeze when suddenly the dragon speaks to you. The creature has the voice of a man.</p>
<p>The dragon pleads with you for the return of the statuette, for he says that it will remove the curse that has changed his shape. Your Kai senses detect that the creature speaks the truth, and that he is not the evil bane that the elder and the villagers have led you to believe. You notice that the elder and his men have left their hiding places and are now running towards the hut. You focus on the elder and see that a strange transformation has taken place. He is no longer the frail old man that he was; his face has become younger and it is contorted with a savage rage. Your Kai senses detect an aura of evil that is chillingly familiar. It is identical to that which surrounded Ulonga the Shaman and you sense that he, too, is a necromancer. He orders his men to take aim at you with their bows and blindly they obey his command. The dragon urges you to escape with him while you are able, and hurriedly you rush forward to climb upon his back as the first volley of arrows comes whistling through the hut.</p>
