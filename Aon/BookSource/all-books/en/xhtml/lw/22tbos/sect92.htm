<h3>92</h3>

<p>You estimate that you are less than a mile from the mainland coast—a comfortable distance for a good swimmer, especially for one who possesses the strength and stamina of a Kai Grand Master.</p>
<p>You say farewell to Captain Radyard and he thanks you for your selflessness. He orders his crew to hoist the sails, and he tells his bo’sun to wave a white flag from the stern deck to signal to Sesketera that he is complying with his commands. A longboat is launched from <cite>The Triasus</cite> to collect you. It is carrying an officer and six marines, each armed with a half-pike and a Bor pistol. Radyard suggests that you go to the head of the boarding ladder so that you can surrender to the longboat’s officer when he comes aboard.</p>
<p>‘Who said anything about surrender?’ you retort.</p>
<p>‘But … I thought … ,’ stutters the captain.</p>
<p>‘I’ve no intention of surrendering to Sesketera!’ you say, and before Radyard can utter another word, you vault over the gunwale and plunge feet-first into the clear blue sea.</p>
