<h3>94</h3>

<p>You dismount from your mule and hurry into the village. The fiercest fire is raging through the roof of the largest hut which dominates the centre of the settlement, and it is here that you concentrate your efforts. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you are able to limit the spread of the flames and allow the villagers time to collect water with which they put out the blaze. Your Kai skill protects you from the scorching heat of the fire, but your Backpack is damaged and you lose two pieces of equipment. (Erase any two Backpack Items from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>When all of the smaller fires in the surrounding huts have also been extinguished, the elder of the village thanks you for your timely help. He tells you that the fire was started deliberately by a dragon that dwells in the Hulhuk Mountains.</p>
<p>‘It is the bane of our humble village,’ he says, shaking his head sadly, ‘and we fear that it will return this night to finish us.’ Seeing the Kai Weapon sheathed at your side, the elder looks at you with renewed hope in his eyes. He begs you to stay here tonight and help rid the village of its bane.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stay and help the villagers, <a href="sect267.htm">turn to 267</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide not to help them, <a href="sect213.htm">turn to 213</a>.</p>
