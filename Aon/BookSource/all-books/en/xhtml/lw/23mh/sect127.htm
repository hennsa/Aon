<h3>127</h3>

<p>After an interminable wait you arrive at the front of the slow-moving queue. Without looking up from the books and papers spread around him, the reeve-sergeant motions you to sit down on the bench before his table. With a tone of bored indifference he asks you to state the reason for your visit to the Judicars’ Hall. You tell him that you are looking for Prince Karvas of Siyen, and that you have come here with urgent news of events in his homeland that you must impart to him. The officer rubs his stubbly chin and stares unblinkingly into your eyes. You sense that he doubts your word and is contemplating whether or not he should have you arrested. When you insist that it is vital that you find the Prince he gives a gruff laugh and shrugs his shoulders.</p>
<p>‘Karvas is not here,’ he grunts. ‘Lived here when he first came to Sheasu, maybe ten years ago now, but when his bride arrived he took her up north. They live up there on the coast someplace … not sure where. Rarely visits Mydnight nowadays. That’s all I know.’</p>
<p>You thank the reeve-sergeant for his help and leave. On returning to the street outside the hall you notice that the sun is low on the western horizon. Having spent nearly all day queueing in the Hall of the Judicars for such scant information, you pray that your companions have fared better as you hurry back through the darkening streets towards the eastern quarter of the city.</p>
