<h3>152</h3>

<p>The lightning bolt hits the skyship’s hull directly below the helm, rendering you unconscious as the concussive force of the blast is transmitted upwards through the deck (lose 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>On regaining consciousness you discover that the <cite>Starstrider</cite> is now more than three miles clear of the fissures. As your vision slowly clears you see that Acraban has taken control of the wheel. He smiles when he sees that you are still alive. You notice that he looks gaunt and exhausted, and his ginger hair is matted with grime and sweat. Clearly his efforts to repair the ailing skyship have severely drained his magical energies. As you stagger to the helm you sense that the steering has become more erratic. The <cite>Starstrider</cite> has lost altitude and her deck is starting to tilt alarmingly to starboard. Soon it becomes almost impossible to stand upright.</p>
<p>‘We have lost one stabilizer and the other is badly damaged,’ says Acraban, grimly. ‘I have done all I can to repair it but I fear it will fail us at any moment. Without stabilizers we cannot stay airborne.’ Acraban orders his crew to prepare for a crash landing. Some of the young men tie themselves to the ship’s mainmast, while others brace themselves against the rails and place their fate in the hands of the Goddess Ishir. Prince Karvas has found refuge in a rope locker which is bolted to the main deck. He lifts the lid and calls out to you to join him for there is sufficient space for two inside.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to climb into the rope locker alongside Prince Karvas, <a href="sect79.htm">turn to 79</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to stay with Acraban at the ship’s helm, <a href="sect199.htm">turn to 199</a>.</p>
