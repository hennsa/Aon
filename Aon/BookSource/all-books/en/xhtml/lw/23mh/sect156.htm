<h3>156</h3>

<p>At first your senses lead you to believe that a tempest is brewing, that the fluctuating air pressure is merely the prelude to a violent electrical storm. You magnify your vision and scan the horizon in sure expectation, but, to your surprise, you see neither lightning bolts nor storm clouds in the far distance. Then your Kai senses detect the source of the shifting pressure: it is coming up from the ground.</p>
<p>Rapidly the blanket of cloud below the keel dissipates to reveal a stark landscape of black volcanic rock. It is scarred by deep chasms and fissures, some of which emit jets of steam that roar skywards to buffet the hub of the <cite>Starstrider</cite> as it passes by. These colossal jets condense to form strange green-grey clouds which slowly drift and tumble back to the ground. One such cloud forms in the air and begins to fall on a collision course with the ship. Acraban sees the threat and he orders Kuo, his helmsman, to descend 300 feet in order to evade the falling cloud mass. As he obeys the wizard’s command, you sense suddenly that this manoeuvre could place the ship in greater danger, from the roaring jets of steam.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to tell Acraban to cancel his last command and order the helmsman to climb 300 feet instead, <a href="sect98.htm">turn to 98</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide it is best to leave the steering of the skyship to Acraban and his crewmen, <a href="sect290.htm">turn to 290</a>.</p>
