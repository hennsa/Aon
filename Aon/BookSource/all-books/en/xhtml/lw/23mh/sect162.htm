<h3>162</h3>

<p>‘It is I, my lord Marshal,’ says Karvas. ‘Do you not recognize me?’</p>
<p>‘Prince Karvas! By the gods, how can this be?’ exclaims Marshal Phedros. ‘This wine must have addled my brain, for Karvas dwells in exile. You cannot be him. This is another of Sadanzo’s foul tricks, I’ll be bound.’</p>
<p>Karvas pulls up the sleeve of his tunic and advances towards Phedros to show him the crescent-shaped birthmark on his wrist. But Phedros, his senses wine-dulled, mistakes his advance for an attack. ‘Seize them!’ he bellows, and immediately four of the Marshal’s bodyguards emerge from the shadows of the mess hall. Two of them wrestle Karvas to the ground, while the others come rushing at you with their swords drawn. Rather than risk the Prince’s life by resisting these guards, you raise your hands in surrender. Karvas begs Phedros to believe that he truly is the Crown Prince of Siyen. He asks that he be allowed to explain how he returned to his homeland, but Phedros refuses to listen to his pleas. He calls for more guards and he commands them to confiscate your Weapons and equipment. Then you are both taken to the barracks’ cells where you are placed in irons.</p>

<p>It is in the early hours of the morning when the cell door bangs open and in shuffles Marshal Phedros in the company of Baron Sadanzo and a dozen of his robber knights. The Baron cackles with glee when he sees Karvas chained to the wall. He takes a glowing green gem from the pocket of his ermine robes, and immediately your Sixth Sense warns you that this stone is radiating strong psychic energies. Through its use, Sadanzo is able to exert a powerful control over Phedros’ mind.</p>
<p>‘So, Marshal Phedros,’ says Sadanzo, in a quiet, silky-smooth voice that is chillingly evil, ‘this is the impostor and his accomplice. Pray tell me, my lord, what is the punishment for impersonating a member of the Royal household?’</p>
<p>‘It … is … death,’ croaks Phedros. By the forced sound of his voice you can tell that the Marshal does not speak of his own free will.</p>
<p>Prince Karvas rails against his shackles and shouts out in protest, but the gem flares in Sadanzo’s hand and instantly Karvas ceases to speak or move. Your Sixth Sense tells you that your psychic Kai defences are preventing you from succumbing to the power of this evil gem, a power that has rendered Karvas incapable of speech or movement.</p>
<p>‘Well, my loyal knights,’ says Sadanzo, addressing his gloating henchmen, ‘did you not hear the Marshal? The punishment for their crime is death.’ The Baron looks at you and Karvas and a malicious smile spreads slowly across his taut, cadaverous face. ‘By the power invested in me as King of Siyen, I sentence you both to death. Sentence to be carried out … at once!’</p>
<p>And with these fateful words ringing in their ears, the robber knights unsheathe their swords and move forward to carry out the Baron’s order of execution. Mercifully, death is swift for you both.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your quest end here in the cells of the Royal Cavalry Barracks of Siyen.</p>
