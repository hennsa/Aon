<h3>17</h3>

<p>You descend the stairs and make your way through the taproom crowd to the two Cavalian lordlings who are sipping wine at the counter.</p>
<p>‘Good evening, my lords,’ says Karvas, politely. ‘My friend and I were wondering if you two gentlemen are bound for Seroa this night.’</p>
<p>The Cavalians regard you with disdain as they sip their perfumed wine from long-stemmed glasses.</p>
<p>‘And what business would it be of yours, pray tell?’ retorts the taller of the two.</p>
<p>‘We wish to buy two tickets for the riverboat to Seroa,’ you reply, truthfully.</p>
<p>‘My, my,’ tuts the shorter, plumper man. ‘I do believe they want us to sell our tickets, Foluge. Would you credit their nerve?’</p>
<p>The taller dandy utters a terse laugh and he flicks his fingers at you dismissively. ‘We’ve waited many years for Baron Sadanzo to come to power, and we would not miss his crowning for all the Orla in Siyen.’</p>
<p>‘Yea, ’tis so,’ fawns his stout companion. ‘When Baron Sadanzo becomes King we shall both become rich men. Now leave us. We have no tickets to sell and we tire of your company.’</p>
