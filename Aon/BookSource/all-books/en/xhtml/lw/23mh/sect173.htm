<h3>173</h3>

<p>‘So you’re on your way to Seroa, eh?’ says the Knight Bachelor. ‘If you are there in time for Harvestmas then you’ll see the crowning of Baron Sadanzo. I only wish I could be there myself to celebrate that happy day. Alas, someone must remain to protect Cavalia while our master, our future king, is away.’</p>
<p>Karvas asks the young knight why he and his men are wearing the crown of Siyen upon their shields and surcoats. ‘I thought,’ he says, taking care to mask his native Siyenese accent, ‘that it is customary here in Siyen for only soldiers of the King’s Guard to wear the royal crown? Is it not so?’</p>
<p>The Knight Bachelor glares at Karvas and you sense that the Prince’s comments have stung him. ‘Our master is … will be … the King of Siyen,’ he blusters. ‘There is no other who claims the throne of our realm. We wear the crown in honour of his right to ascendance. Perhaps you foreigners oppose our Baron’s right?’</p>
<p>The Knight Bachelor stares accusingly into your eyes. When he gets no reaction, he jerks his head back to Karvas and fixes the Prince with the same cold, unblinking gaze. Your Kai Sixth Sense informs you that this Knight Bachelor is a greedy and ambitious young man who is hungry for promotion. Unwittingly, Karvas has insulted his honour and, to save face in front of his men, he is thinking of arresting you both on the suspicion that you are spies. You know that you must act swiftly if you are to avoid this.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to apologize to the Knight Bachelor and tell him that your companion did not mean any insult by what he said, <a href="sect95.htm">turn to 95</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to offer the Knight Bachelor a bribe in the hope that he will allow you and Karvas to go on your way, <a href="sect161.htm">turn to 161</a>.</p>
