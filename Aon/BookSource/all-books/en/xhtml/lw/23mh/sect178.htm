<h3>178</h3>

<p>Beyond the draperies you find a circular chamber with a polished wooden floor. The dark oak surface is inlaid with lighter woods which form intricate pentagrams and other mystical patterns. The walls are lined with shelves which store a vast number of books, scrolls, and parchments. Your Kai senses warn you that these are works of great evil; it is a library of sorcerous manuals and tomes of worship dedicated to Naar. Prince Karvas is repulsed by the sight of this evil repository. It confirms the suspicion he has held for many years, that Baron Sadanzo is a secret disciple of the Dark God.</p>
<p>You scan the walls and your Kai senses reel in the face of the evil that festers here. Your instincts tell you to destroy these vile works, to put them to the torch, yet to do so could jeopardise your chances of making a successful escape from the citadel. Rather than take that risk you decide to leave this evil library at once, but as you are retreating towards the archway you notice a square plate of steel sandwiched among the books on a middle shelf. A closer look reveals it to be the door of a wall safe. There is a dial at its centre, similar to the cylinder lock which secured the door to your prison cell. Your Sixth Sense reveals that only two digits are required to open this safe.</p>
<p>The first number in the sequence is equal to the number of bonus points added to <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> when the Kai Weapon ‘Alema’ is used against undead enemies. The second is equivalent to half of the <cite>Starstrider</cite>’s full complement of crewmen (not including Acraban).</p>
<p class="puzzle">When you think you know the two-digit answer, note down the figures in order and <a href="numbered.htm">turn to the section of the book</a> which is the same as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect178-1-foot" name="sect178-1">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you are unable to determine the correct solution, <a href="sect258.htm">turn instead to 258</a>.</p>
