<h3>181</h3>

<p>‘Perhaps I have not made myself clear,’ says Karvas, his voice now deep and menacing. ‘My friend and I need your tickets. Kindly hand them over without a fuss.’ The Prince pulls his sword a few inches from its scabbard to reinforce his demand.</p>
<p>Normally these two fops would blanch and faint in the face of such an open threat, but a night spent drinking at the tavern has filled them with liquid courage. The taller man stares Karvas defiantly in the eye and then he begins to shout at the top of his voice: ‘Robbers! Footpads! Cut-throats!’</p>
<p>Karvas reacts instinctively. He punches the dandy squarely on the jaw and leaves him sprawled unconscious on the ground. His stout companion freezes and his mouth drops open with shock. Before he, too, can scream out in alarm, you knock him out with a sharp blow to the nape of his neck.</p>
<p>Quickly you drag their bodies into the alleyway and rifle their pockets in a search for their tickets. Karvas finds both of them in the jacket pocket of the stout lordling, and he hands one to you. (Record the Riverboat Ticket on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep in the pocket of your breeches. You need not discard another item in its favour if you already possess the maximum number of Special Items permissible.)</p>
<p>Having now obtained what you need to reach Seroa by boat, you leave the alleyway and hurry back to the jetty.</p>
