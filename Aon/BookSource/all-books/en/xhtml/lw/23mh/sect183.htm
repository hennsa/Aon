<h3>183</h3>

<p>You are desperate to keep ahead of the herd for fear of being trampled under their pounding hooves. Yet, as you approach the fast-flowing river, you are forced to tug hard on your horse’s reins to slow him to a walk. The bank ahead is steeply undercut. If you were to rush headlong over the edge, you and your horse would plummet more than 20 feet into the rushing river.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Karvas reacts swiftly when he sees you slowing your horse and he is able to rein in his mount behind you. Following your lead, he coaxes his horse over the edge of the steep bank and he is able to control his descent down the bank towards a narrow strip of muddy clay at the water’s edge. Above you, the leading fanji come thundering over the edge to tumble into the river with a mighty splash. They barely break the surface before they are swept downstream by the strong current. More than a hundred fanji crash into the river and are washed away before the remainder of the herd comes to a halt. You coax your horse forward and for two miles you keep him to the narrow strip of sticky soil which borders the river, until you reach a place where the steep bank tapers away to a gentle incline. Here, you are able to leave the river and climb the bank to the grassy plain. As you crest the top of the bank, you see the remaining herd scattering in all directions as, relentlessly, the hunters pursue them.</p>
