<h3>188</h3>

<p>You take a scroll, one of many that are crammed between the books that line the surrounding shelves, and you place it in the empty safe. Then you recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i> and point your right index finger at the scroll. An arc of crackling fire jumps from your hand and ignites the yellowed parchment, causing it to burn fiercely. You wait for a few moments until all that remains of the scroll is a layer of flaky ash, and then you slam shut the door and spin its dial. Now, should Sadanzo open his safe, he will find that his contract with the Assassins’ Guild has mysteriously combusted.</p>
<p>Your work done, you turn away from the safe and motion Karvas to follow as you hurry to leave this evil library. But, as you are approaching the arch which leads to the adjoining chamber, you suddenly hear a noise which makes you both stop dead in your tracks.</p>
