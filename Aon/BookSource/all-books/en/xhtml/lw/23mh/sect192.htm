<h3>192</h3>

<p>You fix the trader with a piercing stare and quietly breathe the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mind Charm</i>. As the spell takes hold, you command him mentally to signal to his men that all is well between you. Your magical charm instils a sense of calm well-being into the man and he begins to relax and smile. He complies with your command and the two Mythenians turn away. When you are sure that they are out of earshot, you ask the trader if he knows the whereabouts of Prince Karvas of Siyen. He tells you that the Prince does not reside in the city. There is a rumour that he lives somewhere on the remote northern coast of Sheasu. He also tells you that Karvas is not alone. Shortly after he came here, almost a decade ago, he was joined by a young woman. They were married by a sea captain in Mydnight harbour, on board the deck of his trading ship, and ever since their wedding day they have rarely been seen again.</p>
<p>You thank the trader for his help and leave the warehouse before the effects of the spell wear off. On returning to the quayside you set out to explore the tangle of alleyways that make up the city’s eastern quarter in the hope of discovering more about the Prince and his wife. Unfortunately, your efforts garner no new information. As the sun begins to settle on the horizon, you abandon your search and hurry back through the darkening passageways towards the market square.</p>
