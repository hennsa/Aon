<h3>199</h3>

<p>You brace yourself against the ship’s rail and watch with trepidation as Acraban fights to maintain control over his ailing skyship. Your stomach churns as the deck heaves from side to side, and your heart misses a beat when there is a sudden jolt and a fearful sound of screeching metal.</p>
<p>‘We’ve lost the second stabilizer!’ shouts Acraban in alarm. The wheel is suddenly wrenched from his grasp and it begins to spin out of control. The <cite>Starstrider</cite> has been losing height for several minutes, but now its angle of descent becomes far steeper. The skyship dives through a bank of low cloud and a great sea of trees comes rushing up to meet the bow. You grip the rail as tightly as you can and await the dreadful moment of impact. There is a splintering <i>crack</i> of timber when the hull collides with the treetops, and then, moments later, there is a terrific jolt as the craft’s bow slams into the rocky soil and comes to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>The impact of the crash wrenches your hands from the rail and sends you tumbling across the stern deck.</p>
