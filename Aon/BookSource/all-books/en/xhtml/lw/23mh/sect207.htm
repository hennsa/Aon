<h3>207</h3>

<p>As the remaining rider presses home his attack, you draw your Kai Weapon and get ready to strike as he passes. Karvas sidesteps the tip of his weapon and simultaneously you stab at the lancer as he gallops his horse between you. His lance spins through the air and you hear his plaintive death-cry as he tumbles out of the saddle. As you glance over your shoulder, you see him crash to the ground and roll limply across the cobblestones. The citizens who crowd this passageway cheer the lancer’s demise and some rush forward to pick his pockets and loot his armour.</p>
<p>You focus your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control upon the two horses and you summon them to approach yourself and Prince Karvas. Obediently they obey your mental commands, and quickly you are able to mount them and make good your escape from this passageway into a wider street at its eastern end.</p>
