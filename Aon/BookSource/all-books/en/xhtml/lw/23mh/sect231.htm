<h3>231</h3>

<p>You climb the wall with little difficulty. As you settle your feet securely between the spikes in readiness to leap into the training field that lies beyond, you see that there is a guard standing directly below your position. Without a moment’s hesitation, you leap onto his back and bring him crashing to the ground. He tries to shout out but a sharp blow to the base of his skull renders him unconscious before his cry has left his lips. Instinctively you scan the perimeter of the field and the buildings beyond in case you have been seen, but there appear to be no other guards on duty. (If you made use of a Rope during your climb you must now erase it from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. In your haste to silence the guard you have left it behind, fixed to a spike, and hanging down the far side of the wall.)</p>
