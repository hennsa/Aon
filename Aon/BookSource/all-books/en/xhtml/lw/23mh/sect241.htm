<h3>241</h3>

<p>The tavern-keeper looks at the Ren with a mixture of suspicion and disdain. ‘Bah, lousy Bakhasian coinage,’ he spits, and he takes away the frothing tankards and places them under the counter.</p>
<p>‘I’ll not accept Ren in my tavern. There’s some in this town that do, but I’ll touch nothing that comes from Bhanar since my son, Foulse, was murdered last year in Bakhasa.’ The tavern-keeper looks to the garrison soldiers seated at the table and indicates, with a jerk of his thumb towards the door, that he wants them to throw you out.</p>
<p>‘That won’t be necessary,’ says Karvas, and he tugs at your sleeve. ‘We’ll leave of our own accord.’</p>
<p>You abandon the Ren (erase these from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>) and return to your horses. You are disappointed that you have not been able to slake your thirst, but you are also mindful that you still have many miles to travel before you reach Seroa.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to visit the trading post before you leave Battle Pass, <a href="sect120.htm">turn to 120</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to depart without further delay, <a href="sect230.htm">turn to 230</a>.</p>
