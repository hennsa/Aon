<h3>263</h3>

<p>You dive to avoid your enemy’s lance, timing your move to perfection. As you roll over and spring back to your feet, so you lash out with your Kai Weapon and its tip cuts clean through the belly-strap of his saddle. Moments later, he tumbles from his horse and crashes heavily among the trees that border the trail.</p>
<p>His followers curse you bitterly when their leader fails to stand. They fear he is either unconscious or has broken his neck in the fall. Using your Kai skills, you command your horse to come to you and he obeys at once. Before the Bakhasians can enact their revenge, you are able to mount up and ride back towards Karvas. In the distance you can see that the tree is now burning less fiercely. On approaching the Prince, you call for him to follow as you race along the trail towards the flaming pine. Bravely your horse makes a tremendous leap across the tree to land surefootedly on the trail beyond. As you bring him to a halt, you pat his neck in praise for his courageous action. Moments later, you see Karvas come leaping over the trunk and you cheer his masterful display of horsemanship. The Bakhasians choose not to follow you. They break off their pursuit and allow you to make good your escape into the foothills of the Dammerdon Mountains.</p>
