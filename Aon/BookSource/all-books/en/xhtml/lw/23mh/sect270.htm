<h3>270</h3>

<p>News of Karvas’ return spreads like wildfire through the capital. Hundreds of cheering citizens enter the square and surround the platform on all sides, weeping and shouting with joy that they are to be spared the tyranny of Sadanzo’s rule. With the blessing of the gathered nobles, Marshal Phedros proclaims Karvas the King of Siyen and he places the State Crown upon his head. Gladly Karvas accepts his birthright and he rises to receive the adulation of the excited crowd. As the cheering gradually subsides, he turns to you and bids you kneel before him. You obey his command and Karvas unsheathes his sword. He dabs its blade lightly upon your head and smiles:</p>

<p>‘Arise, Sir Kai, for I proclaim that you are now a Knight of Siyen.’ The crowd cheer loudly, though not for their king. This time their cheers are for the Kai Grand Master of Sommerlund without whom their beloved Prince would never have claimed his throne.</p>
<p>You accompany King Karvas and his noble entourage to the Royal Palace where the celebration of his ascendance to the throne begins with a banquet, and concludes with a procession of royal coaches that visits every quarter of the city. The citizens of Seroa shower their new king with flowers. They also call for the swift execution of the traitor Sadanzo. The following day you learn that Karvas has granted his citizens their request for justice. Baron Sadanzo is sentenced to death, the execution to be carried out at noon in the Palace Square. Upon the platform on which he sought to be crowned king, the Baron loses his head to the executioner’s axe.</p>
