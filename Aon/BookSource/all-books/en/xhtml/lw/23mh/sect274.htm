<h3>274</h3>

<p>The number of guards and the frequency of the patrols make it too dangerous to attempt to gain entry to the stables from the square, and so you decide to search around the perimeter wall to see if there is an easier way. Karvas gets ready to move from behind the cart, but you tell him to stay here and wait for your signal.</p>
<p>‘Better I should go alone, my lord,’ you say. ‘It will halve the risk of being seen. Wait here for my signal and be prepared to act quickly when you see it.’ The Prince nods his agreement and he wishes you good luck before you depart.</p>
<p>Using your Kai camouflage skills to keep yourself hidden from the watchful guards, you scurry away from the cart and skirt around the high perimeter wall. On the west side of the compound you discover that the wall is lower and the number of passing soldiers is fewer and less frequent. You run to the base of the wall and, as you look up at its spiked top, you ponder the best way you can reach the other side.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy, <a href="sect336.htm">turn to 336</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you choose not to use it, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
