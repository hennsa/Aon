<h3>278</h3>

<p>You draw an Arrow from your Quiver, take aim, and fire in one smooth movement. Your shaft speeds towards the leading hunter and burrows deep into his chest, knocking him clean out of his saddle. Upon seeing his comrade fall, the other hunter tugs hard on his horse’s reins and turns him around to gallop back to the others. Rather than risk having to face them all, you decide that now would be a good time to leave. You motion to Karvas and he follows as you thread your way through the trees to the far side of the hillock. As soon as you are clear, you race away together as fast as your horses will carry you.</p>
<p>You are more than two miles from the hillock when you bring your panting steeds to a halt and look back. You see the fanji herd have been scattered by the hunters and they are running in all directions. The hunters show no interest in pursuing you; their only concern appears to be slaying as many fanji as possible. The sight of this wanton slaughter raises your ire, but you quell your anger and ride on with Karvas through the tall grass, back towards the trail.</p>
