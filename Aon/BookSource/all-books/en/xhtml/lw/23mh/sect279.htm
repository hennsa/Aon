<h3>279</h3>

<p>Your skill and persistence pay off when you hear the dull <i>click</i> that tells you that you have successfully picked the lock. You twist the iron door handle and push it open to reveal a circular stone staircase which leads all the way to the bell chamber at the top of the tower. Here you are treated to a spectacular view of the city. Aided by your night vision, you locate stables less than a mile to the north of the tower. You commit their location to memory and then hurriedly you descend the stairs to the antechamber below.</p>
<p>On your return to the warehouse, Prince Karvas is delighted to hear that there are stables in the city and he insists that you set off for them at once. He is leading the way out of the ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors swing open and the procession of black-clad figures file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they pass by, you peer around the edge of the crumbling warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of unease makes the skin on the back of your neck prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with shock at what you see.</p>
