<h3>32</h3>

<p>The farmer seems bemused by your refusal. His fee is very reasonable, especially when compared to the charge you would be expected to pay for crossing the river at the Voshno Bridge. When he tells you that there are no other river crossings for 30 miles in either direction, you ask if he would accept something other than cash in return for the use of his raft. After a few moments’ thought, he says that he would accept either 1 Weapon or 1 Backpack Item.</p>
<p>If you possess sufficient cash, you can still pay the farmer a fee of 8 Lune, or 2 Gold Crowns. If you do not have enough money, you must give him either 1 Weapon or 1 Backpack Item of your choice. (Make the appropriate changes to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>The farmer ferries you and your horse across the river, and then he goes back to collect Karvas and his mount. Once the Prince is safely across, you bid the cheerful man farewell and ride away from the river, heading east. You notice that Prince Karvas is smiling as he rides across this lush river valley and you ask him why he is so happy. He explains that the Ioma is the political boundary between the realms of Lunarlia and Siyen, and having crossed the river you are now on Siyenese soil. After ten years in exile he has, at last, returned to his homeland.</p>
<p>Dusk is turning to darkness when you come to a road that traverses the plain to the east of Voshno. Your horses are tired and so you decide to camp for the night in a small wood that borders this road. Before you rest, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery).</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect125.htm">turn to 125</a>.</p>
