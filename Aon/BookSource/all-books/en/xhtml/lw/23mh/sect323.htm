<h3>323</h3>

<p>While the horses are drinking, you laugh with Karvas when you recall the startled faces of the militiamen as you galloped through their dithering ranks at Bakhasa’s east gate, and you take the opportunity to give him the sword and belt that you took from the sleeping guard at the Tehda Stables. He smiles as he buckles it on his hip and then he unsheathes the blade to gauge its weight and balance.</p>
<p>‘Not the best steel I’ve ever handled,’ he muses, ‘but better than no steel at all. I’m indebted to you, Grand Master.’<sup><a href="#sect323-1-foot" name="sect323-1">11</a></sup></p>
<p>It is an hour past midnight and the passing of another day rekindles thoughts of the road ahead. With only nineteen days to Harvestmas, the city of Seroa still seems a very long way away. But you draw some comfort from the fact that you now have two fine stallions. They are sure to make the long road seem far shorter. You are admiring them when suddenly they stop drinking and become agitated. You scan the surrounding trees yet you detect nothing untoward. Then you hear the sound of approaching hoofbeats and you curse yourself for being complacent.</p>
<p>‘I should have known they would not let us get away with two horses as fine as these,’ you say, as hurriedly you and Karvas climb back into the saddle. You urge your horses across the ford and, as you take to the trail beyond, you look over your shoulder to see half a dozen armed Bakhasians come galloping along the trail towards the stream. They are led by a warrior who is sheathed from head to toe in shiny black armour and he holds a metal staff raised in his gauntleted hand. Beyond the stream the trail narrows as it ascends into the forested hills.</p>
<p>As you reach the crest of a ridge, you glance back to see that your pursuers are gaining on you. The leader aims his staff and a ball of flame hurtles from its tip to come streaking between you and the Prince. This fiery missile fails to strike its target, but the heat and noise of its passing startles Karvas’ horse. The Prince controls his mount with admirable skill, yet in so doing he loses speed and is soon left trailing over 100 yards behind. You wave to him, urging him frantically to catch up, and he signals to you to ride on. When you turn to look at the trail ahead, you are shocked to see that it is now blocked by a burning tree. The fiery missile has struck and felled a pine and ignited its inflammable sap. As you gallop towards this blazing trunk, your heart sinks when you see that it blocks the narrow trail: there is no clear way around it.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to jump your horse over this blazing pine trunk, <a href="sect204.htm">turn to 204</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to rein in your horse and turn to face your pursuers, <a href="sect60.htm">turn to 60</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect323-1-foot" href="#sect323-1">11</a>] The reason that the Prince is unarmed remains unexplained. He is armed in <a href="sect170.htm">Section 170</a>, and no explicit statement since then explains why he has lost or forsaken his short sword.</p></div>
