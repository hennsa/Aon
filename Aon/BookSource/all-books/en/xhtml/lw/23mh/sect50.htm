<h3>50</h3>

<p>Sadanzo gasps as your killing blow pierces his heart. He drops to his knees and the gem in his hand suddenly crumbles and disintegrates to dust. With his last ounce of strength he lunges at you with his sword, but you sidestep his last, desperate thrust, and he crashes lifelessly to the floor.</p>
<p>The destruction of Sadanzo’s gem frees the Siyenese nobles from its evil influence, an influence that had robbed them of their free will. Marshal Phedros immediately orders that the city gates be sealed, and then he commands the Royal Guardsmen and the Court Cavalry to hunt down Sadanzo’s robber knights in every quarter of Seroa and bring them to justice. As these noble troopers eagerly set about their task, Phedros turns to Prince Karvas and hugs him to his chest. ‘Welcome home at last, my boy,’ he says, his voice wavering with emotion. ‘Welcome home … King Karvas.’</p>
