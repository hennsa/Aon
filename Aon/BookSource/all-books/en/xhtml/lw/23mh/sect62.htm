<h3>62</h3>

<p>You glance at Karvas and give a slight, almost imperceptible nod of your head. The Prince narrows his eyes in recognition that he understands you are going to attempt to break free from these Cavalian horsemen.</p>
<p>You dig your heel into your horse’s flank and he suddenly rears up and scrabbles at the air with his forelegs. The Knight Bachelor pulls back on his reins and turns his steed aside to avoid being struck by the flailing hooves. At this moment, you press yourself flat against your horse’s neck and urge him forwards. The knight’s men bring their mounts together to block your escape, but your horse is quick to the gallop. He surges forwards and forces himself between two troopers, barging them from the saddle as he pushes through their stationary ranks. As you break out of the circle, you hear a cry and it sends a shiver down your spine. You recognize the Prince’s voice. When you glance back you see that he has been unsaddled and he is now lying on the ground, helpless before the stamping steel-shod hooves of the Knight Bachelor’s warhorse.</p>
<p>‘Surrender yourself, Northlander!’ commands the arrogant Cavalian knight. ‘Or your journeyman companion dies!’</p>
<p>Reluctantly you rein in your horse and raise your hands. Better to surrender and live to fight another day than allow Prince Karvas to be crushed by the hooves of this arrogant knight’s horse.</p>
