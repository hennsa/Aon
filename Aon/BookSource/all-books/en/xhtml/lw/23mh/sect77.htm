<h3>77</h3>

<p>You strike a killing blow and the last of the robber knights tumbles backwards over the parapet of the bridge to splash into the rushing river. There is a moment of deathly hush, and then the silence is shattered by an eruption of whooping and cheering. The citizens of Voshno have gathered to watch your fight and now they are applauding your brave victory. For more than a month this band of murdering knights have been abusing the people of this hamlet, and any traveller who has sought to cross their bridge. Now, at last, their reign of terror has ended.</p>
<p>The grateful villagers insist that you and Karvas spend the night as their guests at the Fuller’s Inn, the best tavern and hostelry on the east bank of Voshno. Your horses are groomed and you are treated to a delicious feast at the owner’s expense, after which you are given the finest rooms in the hostelry (you may restore 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points). As you are retiring to bed, you notice that Prince Karvas is smiling delightedly. At first you think it is just the food and fine ale that have cheered him so, but he tells you it is more than this. He explains that the east side of Voshno is Siyenese territory, part of his native country, and after ten years in exile he could not have wished for a more appreciative homecoming.</p>
