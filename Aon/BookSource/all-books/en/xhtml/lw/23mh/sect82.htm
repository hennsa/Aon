<h3>82</h3>

<p>You grab the soldier’s spear, barge him aside, and then take off along the avenue at a run with Prince Karvas close on your heels. The soldier staggers to his feet and attempts to give chase, but he soon loses you both in the darkness and is forced to give up his pursuit.</p>
<p>You hurry through the city, past grimy two-storey houses of hardwood that are silent behind their bolts and shutters. The wide thoroughfare leads to a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda and then continues into the heart of the east quarter. Here you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You observe the ten-strong patrol as it marches past. These men are clad in black quilted tunics and wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. All are almond-eyed and they have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the bridge, yet as they do so, another patrol comes tramping along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden in the timber yard and attempt to catch a few hours’ sleep before dawn.</p>
