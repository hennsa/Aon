<h3>86</h3>

<p>You can hear the sound of metal scraping on stone above your head. When you look up at the ceiling, you see a pair of crossed swords cocooned by pale amber tongues of flame. These flames give off no heat and you recognize at once that they are magical. The swords are slowly rotating, their shiny steel blades skimming the ceiling stones as they gather speed. Sparks fly, and then the blades separate and come whirling towards you with frightening speed. Swiftly you raise your Kai Weapon and fend off a stunning blow as one of the magical blades flashes past your head in a scything arc. Karvas unsheathes his sword and parries the other blade as it sweeps around the room and strikes at him from behind. Having failed to draw blood with their initial attack, the blades return to the ceiling where they hover menacingly above your heads. But you sense the threat has not passed. Their magical power is recharging itself, increasing its intensity in readiness for a second, swifter attack.</p>
