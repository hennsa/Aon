<h3>10</h3>

<p>‘Vandyan is out for revenge,’ says Delissa, as she hurries to her bookcase. ‘He must have sent every guard in the city out hunting for you this night.’ She opens the secret compartment that contains the plans of Skull-Tor, and removes a clear crystal sphere that lies beneath them. You recognize that this sphere is a seeing stone, for Gwynian possesses one that is identical. It is through the use of these seeing stones that he has maintained contact with his agents in Duadon. Delissa places the stone on a table and she recites the arcane words which activate it. A milky mist swirls at its core and then rapidly it dissipates to reveal Gwynian’s smiling face.</p>
<p>The wise sage congratulates you for the success of your mission. He tells you that the Vorka have been destroyed and the Eldenoran armies are retreating on every front. He is saddened to hear of Hulsta’s death and he consoles Delissa with the promise that her husband will be remembered and revered as a hero in the years to come. She is heartened by his kind words and she reaffirms her vow to help keep you safe until you are able to return to your homeland.</p>
<p>Gwynian informs you both that a rendezvous has been arranged to take place at dusk in three days’ time. You are to meet with Guildmaster Banedon aboard his flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> at a place called ‘Xaitar’s Rock’. It is a landmark located in the hills 10 miles to the north of Duadon, close to the Luyen road. Delissa says that she knows it well.</p>
<p>‘Banedon will take you to Varetta where we shall meet again soon at the Halls of Learning,’ says the sage. ‘But until that glorious day, you must remain vigilant. You have dealt Vandyan a mortal blow. Now that his days are numbered, he will do everything in his power to avenge the destruction of the runes. Be warned, Grand Master. A viper is most dangerous when it knows it is doomed.’</p>
