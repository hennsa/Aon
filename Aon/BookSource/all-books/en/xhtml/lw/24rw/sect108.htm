<h3>108</h3>

<p>You recite the words of the spell and launch a bolt of energy that strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a loud <i>Crack!</i> and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as the evil stone is sundered in two. Seconds later, the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and instinctively you cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken stone cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers. When this deluge ceases, you look with fearful expectation upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber.</p>
<p>Pools of fire burn among the shards that litter the floor of the pit, and the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>
<p>The noise of the destruction and the hellish dying shrieks of the Vorka horde alert Vandyan to your presence in the hall below. You look up and see his face twisted with hate and rage. He raises a glowing silver disc, clasped tightly in the palm of his right hand, and he spits out a vile curse that chills your blood.</p>
