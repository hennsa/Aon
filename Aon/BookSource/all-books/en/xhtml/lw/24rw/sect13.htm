<h3>13</h3>

<p>You crouch beside the body of the Vorka with your weapon held ready to strike. You are expecting to be attacked again at any moment, but something is drawing the creatures away to the river. Then you realize that your provisions have been discovered under the boat’s canvas, and it is the scent of your food that is enticing them away.</p>
<p>The Vorka rush through the trees, but they arrive too late to share in the unexpected feast and they proceed to vent their frustrations on the boat itself. You are taken aback by the sheer speed and ferocity of their attack which reduces your sailboat to matchwood. Silently you watch as they go back to the bridge and cross once more to the other side of the river. The incident seems to have amused the Eldenoran guards, and you can hear them laughing and cursing wildly. You decide to wait until their excitement has cooled a little before you attempt to leave your hiding place. During your wait you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (you are unable to use Grand Huntmastery to forage for food in this instance).</p>
