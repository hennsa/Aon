<h3>137</h3>

<p>Hulsta groans when he sees that the passage ahead is blocked by a solid brick wall. He holds up his lantern and its yellow light washes over the uneven surface, illuminating mouldering mortar which is several centuries old. He taps the stonework with the hilt of his dagger and listens expertly to its dull note. ‘More than 3 feet thick,’ he mutters. ‘It’ll take time to dig through this.’</p>
<p>Delayed but undeterred by the wall, you and Hulsta try hard to think of a way to reach the tunnel beyond and you determine two possibilities. The first is to dig a hole in the wall just large enough through which to crawl. The second is to retrace your steps to the last floor grating that you passed. If you are able to remove this grating and drop down into the underground river, the current would carry you along. You could pass under the brick wall and then return to the tunnel through the first grating that you find.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to attempt to make a hole in the wall, <a href="sect162.htm">turn to 162</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to get past the wall by means of the underground river, <a href="sect214.htm">turn to 214</a>.</p>
