<h3>144</h3>

<p>The bitter shock of Hulsta’s sudden demise hits you like a warhammer in the chest. For several minutes you kneel and stare at his lifeless hand as you struggle to overcome your feelings of grief and remorse. When at last you feel able to continue, you stand up and salute your fallen companion. Then you say a short prayer to the Goddess Ishir to watch over his soul, and you vow to complete your mission in his honour. The swift and successful destruction of the runes will be the best way to ensure that his ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>With grim resolve you leave the rockfall and follow the tunnel away to the east, but you have covered little more than 100 yards when you come to a dead end. You recall what Hulsta had said earlier, and when you examine the wall closely you discover a secret panel. At waist level a raised lever protrudes from the left wall, but when you attempt to pull it down you find that its ancient mechanism has jammed.</p>
