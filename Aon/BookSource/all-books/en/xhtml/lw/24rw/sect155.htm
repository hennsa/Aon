<h3>155</h3>

<p>You continue along the tunnel for several hundred yards until Hulsta calls you to a halt. He holds his lantern up to the wall and you notice that the stonework is changing. A ragged seam encircles the tunnel where brown brickwork meets rough grey rock.</p>
<p>‘This is good,’ says Hulsta, approvingly. ‘We’re passing through the granite foundations of Skull-Tor. According to the plans, this tunnel runs to a dungeon store room, three levels below the surface. We have not far to go now—perhaps two hundred paces at most.’</p>
<p>You are about to lead the way when suddenly you hear a rumbling sound and feel a tremor run through the floor.</p>
<p>‘What was that?’ you ask, anxiously.</p>

<p>Hulsta’s words are suddenly drowned by a deafening noise. The floor shifts violently and you are hurled onto your back as the passageway heaves and shakes. A wide crack appears in the ceiling and you hear Hulsta scream in terror as tons of stone and earth cascade into the tunnel. Helplessly you watch as your companion is buried beneath this deluge of dirt and broken rock.</p>
