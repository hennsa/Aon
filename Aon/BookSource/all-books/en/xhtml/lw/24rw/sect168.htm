<h3>168</h3>

<p>‘Very well,’ you reply, in a hushed tone, ‘let’s get them. But follow my lead, understand?’</p>
<p>Rouf nods his head and draws his weapon, a cavalry sabre taken from one of his Eldenoran captors. Then he follows you around to the front of the cabin where you take up positions on either side of the main door. Using your Magnakai Pathsmanship skills, you mimic a rough Eldenoran accent and bellow: ‘Come out o’ there, you good-for-nothing saddle-crabs!’</p>
<p>Fearing that one of their officers has caught them looting, the Eldenorans drop their plunder and scramble for the door. Two come running through the doorway and they are cut down by your waiting blades, but the third looter leaves by a side door. He is attempting to reach his horse and make a speedy escape. You are anxious to prevent the surviving Eldenoran from escaping. If he gets away he could alert others to your presence here.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Bow and wish to use it, <a href="sect6.htm">turn to 6</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use it, <a href="sect131.htm">turn to 131</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Magi-magic and wish to use it, <a href="sect342.htm">turn to 342</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess neither a Bow nor any of these skills, or if you decide not to use any of them, <a href="sect230.htm">turn to 230</a>.</p>
