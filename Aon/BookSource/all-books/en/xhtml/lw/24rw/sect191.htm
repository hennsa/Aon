<h3>191</h3>

<p>As you enter the clearing, your Magnakai Discipline of Divination makes you aware that this place was recently the site of a terrible crime. You close your eyes and force yourself to concentrate, and slowly a host of terrible images takes shape in your mind’s eye. Beneath the soil of this clearing lie the bodies of a thousand Slovian prisoners of war. Captured when Tekaro fell, they were brought here by Eldenoran guards and murdered by the merciless Vorka. This clearing is the site of their mass grave and you can detect a strong psychic presence. Mostly it comprises a lingering residue formed by the souls of the innocent men who were murdered here, but there is also something else—something invisible yet wholly evil.</p>
<p>Your pulse races when you suddenly realize that this evil entity has come here to feed upon the psychic remains of the slain Slovian prisoners. You are now in its presence and your life is in grave danger.</p>
<p>Immediately you open your eyes and catch a fleeting glimpse of a dark shadow that is sweeping through the surrounding trees. You try to focus upon it but suddenly your head is filled with the blinding pain of a powerful psychic assault.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-screen, <a href="sect150.htm">turn to 150</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, <a href="sect61.htm">turn to 61</a>.</p>
