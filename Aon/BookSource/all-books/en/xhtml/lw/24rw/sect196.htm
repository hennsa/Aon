<h3>196</h3>

<p>Over the course of the next hour, the traffic gradually decreases until the highway is empty of enemy wagons. At this time you approach the road and follow it towards the northwest. By noon, having covered more than 10 miles, you stop to gather a meal of wild berries that are growing along the banks of a stream. While you are eating, two riders approach you from the north. You magnify your vision and see that they are Eldenoran scouts; they are clad in uniforms similar to the one you are wearing. Immediately you look around for a place to hide until they have passed, but when you notice that they are now galloping directly towards you, clearly it is too late to hide: you have already been seen. You leave the stream and step out into the middle of the highway to wave a greeting as the riders approach. You trust this bold action, backed by your Kai Disciplines, will be enough to see you through.</p>
<p>The scouts rein in their mounts and regard you with suspicion. ‘Where’s your horse, trooper?’ asks the older scout.</p>
<p>‘He shed a shoe and went lame,’ you reply. ‘I’ve left him at a farmhouse, 10 miles yonder. I’m trying to get back to Duadon to report the loss.’</p>
<p>The younger scout casts a nervous glance at his older companion and you notice his right hand creeping towards his sword.</p>
<p>‘You’re a long way from your regiment,’ he says, accusingly. ‘Too far to be anything but a deserter … or a spy!’ And with this accusation ringing in your ears, the scouts unsheathe their swords and attempt to cut you down. You must fight them.</p>
