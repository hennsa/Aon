<h3>21</h3>

<p>Rouf bites back his anger as he watches the Eldenorans piling their loot into sacks. Stubbornly, Prizo and his wife refuse to answer their demands and eventually the Eldenorans tire of their obstinacy and leave the cabin. They fix their bulging sacks to their horses’ saddles and mount up, but as they turn to ride away, one of the thieves takes a tinderbox and torch from his pack and sets the torch alight. As the riders gallop past the cabin, he hurls this burning torch through the open doorway.</p>
<p>You are outraged by this murderous act for the two elderly Slovians are tied up and helpless. As the riders disappear into the night, you rush to the doorway of the cabin and enter. Prizo and his wife scream when you appear, for you are wearing an Eldenoran uniform and they think you have come to finish them off. But their terror soon turns to joy when they see Rouf rush into the cabin behind you.</p>
<p>‘Don’t fear!’ shouts Rouf. ‘Your ordeal’s over. My companion’s an ally not an enemy.’</p>
<p>Quickly you extinguish the burning torch, using your Magnakai skill of Nexus, and then you assist Rouf in untying his uncle and aunt.</p>
