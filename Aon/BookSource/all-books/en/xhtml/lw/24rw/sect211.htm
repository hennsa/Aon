<h3>211</h3>

<p>Using the cover of the trees, you skirt around the stone bridge and then follow the river southwards. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans, you stop to sleep for a few hours in the comfortable bough of an oak tree. The night passes without incident and you awaken at dawn to the shrill sound of bird song. Through the thinning canopy of autumn leaves you can see a forest track which runs parallel to the river. A distant flicker of movement catches your eye and, when you magnify your vision, you see three riders approaching from the south. Two are armed and they wear the uniforms of Eldenoran cavalry scouts, but the third is clad in a tunic of scarlet and black—the colours of the Slovian army. His hands are tied and you suspect that he is a prisoner of war. The loss of your sailboat threatens to delay your journey downriver to Tekaro by several days. Mindful of this, you decide to set an ambush for the approaching Eldenoran riders to capture their horses.</p>
<p>From the cover of the trees that border upon the track, you wait until the riders are close and then you draw upon your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to command their horses to stop. They slow to a halt and, despite their riders’ stinging blows, they refuse to take a step further. Silently you unsheathe your Kai Weapon. As soon as the Eldenorans dismount, you leap from your hiding place and take them by surprise.</p>
