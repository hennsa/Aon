<h3>212</h3>

<p>The guards glance at your wristband and nod their approval. They part their crossed spears and allow you to march out across the drawbridge, towards the open archway of the inner keep. As you reach the middle of the bridge, you look to your right and see plumes of black smoke rising up into the night sky. They originate from the chimneys of armouries located on the east side of Skull-Tor. Even at this late hour they are in full production, manufacturing an unending supply of weapons and armour for Vandyan’s Vorka hordes.</p>
<p>Upon entering the archway, you find yourself standing in a circular hall that is hung with tapestries and framed portraits. At a desk positioned in the middle of this hall sits an Eldenoran scribe who is busily writing in a ledger with a quill pen. He is so engrossed with his work that he does not acknowledge your presence in any way. Behind him you see a flight of stairs spiralling up to the floor above, and on either side of the entrance archway there are open portals which lead off to the left and right.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to approach the scribe and ask where you may find Captain Dvedka, <a href="sect60.htm">turn to 60</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose not to approach the scribe, <a href="sect236.htm">turn to 236</a>.</p>
