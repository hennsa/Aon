<h3>220</h3>

<p>The tip of the sergeant’s spear grazes your knee as your horse brushes past him (lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point), but you block the stinging pain of your wound from your mind and urge your horse to the gallop. Eldenoran curses echo across the fields as you race away from their campfire and head towards a distant ribbon of silver that is the River Storn, glimmering in the starlight.</p>
<p>Shortly you come to a highway that runs parallel to the Storn. You cross over this road and descend a bracken-covered slope towards the river’s east bank. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>
<p>Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
