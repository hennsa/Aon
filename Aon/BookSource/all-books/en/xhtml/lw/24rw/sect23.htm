<h3>23</h3>

<p>When you do not meet his demand, the taller guard unsheathes his sword and levels it at your chest. ‘Get your hands up!’ he barks, and meekly you comply; resistance would be futile. He orders the confiscation of your horse and then commands the portcullis be lowered. A wail of protest goes up from those who are queueing to enter Duadon, but the guard is not swayed. He announces that they must wait while you are escorted to the guardhouse. The whistles and jeers of the impatient wagon drivers ring in your ears as you are marched away and taken before the Guard Captain. He is a snub-nosed officer with a brutal demeanour. He orders the two gate guards to wait outside his door while he questions you. When they have left, he takes note of the regimental number that is embroidered on the sleeve of your tunic and then checks it against lists of regiments that are pinned to his wall.</p>
<p>‘Your unit is posted for combat on the Slovarian Plain, trooper,’ he says, in a menacingly quiet way. ‘You had better give good reason for being here or, by Naar, I’ll see you hanged for desertion.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Bardsmanship and have attained the rank of Kai Grand Defender, <a href="sect86.htm">turn to 86</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use it, <a href="sect76.htm">turn to 76</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess either of these skills, or if you have yet to attain the required level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect127.htm">turn to 127</a>.</p>
