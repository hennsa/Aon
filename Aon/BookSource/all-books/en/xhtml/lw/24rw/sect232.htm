<h3>232</h3>

<p>The wheelwright is disappointed that you have not visited his shop on business. Impatiently he replies: ‘I don’t know. You’re looking for a street that’s way over on the north side of Duadon. Go left when you get to the watchtower and you’re in Flank Avenue. Maybe, if you follow it far enough, it’ll lead to Flank Street. I don’t know for sure.’</p>
<p>You thank the wheelwright and leave his shop. When you come to the watchtower at the end of Kettle Street, you turn left and enter Flank Avenue. A signpost bearing its name is topped by a copper badge shaped in the likeness of a galleon with billowing sails, indicating that you are now entering Duadon’s East Quarter.</p>
<p>You walk up Flank Avenue, past the establishments of moneylenders, wagoneers, and rope-makers until you come to a flagstoned square before the city’s East Gate. A column of scaly-skinned Vorka are marching across the square and out through the gate, accompanied by young fresh-faced Eldenoran officers on horseback. You stop to watch the Vorka and, when you look back along their ranks, you see a busy street which leads to the centre of the city. Lurking behind a hazy curtain of acrid grey smoke is the fortress of Skull-Tor, less than half a mile distant. It is from here that the Vorka are emerging. Like some foul discharge, they flow forth in green streams from the newly-constructed armouries that adjoin Vandyan’s grim stronghold.</p>
<p>You resolve to avoid Skull-Tor and continue along Flank Avenue in the hope that it may lead directly to Flank Street. When a gap appears between the marching ranks, you hurry across the square and press on towards the north of the city. Soon you come to a watchtower in the northeast corner of Duadon. Your spirits rise when you see a signpost surmounted by a silver star, for it indicates that you are about to enter the Northern Quarter. But when you read the name engraved below the star you are disappointed to find that it says: North Watch Lane.</p>
<p>Here, on the corner of North Watch Lane, is a glassblower’s workshop. Its doors are open and you can see several craftsmen at work inside. They are shaping and trimming ribbons of molten glass.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter the glassblower’s shop and ask for directions to Flank Street, <a href="sect186.htm">turn to 186</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to enter the shop, you can explore North Watch Lane by <a href="sect123.htm">turning to 123</a>.</p>
