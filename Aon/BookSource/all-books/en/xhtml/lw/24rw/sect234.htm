<h3>234</h3>

<p>The old woman descends to the bottom step and snatches the coins from your palm (remember to erase the relevant number of Gold Crowns from the Belt Pouch section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>‘Very well, you can stay here,’ she grumbles, ‘but be sure you’re gone before daybreak, y’hear?’ Without waiting for you to reply, she scurries up the stairs with an impressive bout of speed and slams the door shut behind her.</p>
<p>It is a frosty night, but you sleep warm and well and leave the stable before dawn, just as the old woman requested. The alleyways and streets of this quarter are empty at this early hour, and you do not see any Eldenorans until you reach a tree-lined avenue that leads to the plaza of Tekaro Cathedral. Vandyan has turned this magnificent building into a dormitory for his troops and, as you pass by its open doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers asleep on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard you with suspicion as your horse plods his way slowly across the frosty plaza. Gently you urge him to increase his pace for fear that they may stop and challenge you.</p>
<p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls you come to the city’s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at your horse and uniform and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. The gate creaks open and quickly you ride through it and out onto a highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the River Storn and you follow it for five miles before you come to a wide cinder track, newly-laid by Eldenoran engineers to service their military ferry across the great river. You recall Rouf’s uncle telling you about the ferry and you decide to take a closer look. You steer your horse onto the cinder track and descend towards a large raft which is moored at the river. There are six Eldenoran guards on duty here, but none pay you too much attention. They all appear to be nursing hangovers this morning and none feel inclined to talk. You ride onto the raft and remain in the saddle as the flat-bottomed ferry is winched by rope and pulley across the Storn. As soon as it comes to a halt, you ride your horse up a wooden ramp and onto a road that has been cleared and levelled by the Eldenoran army through this part of the Grochod Forest. Once clear and beyond sight of the ferry, you leave this military road and enter the trees. The forest is too dense for you to traverse it on horseback and so you abandon your mount and continue on foot.</p>
