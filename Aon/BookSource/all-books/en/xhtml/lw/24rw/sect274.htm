<h3>274</h3>

<p>You place your ear against the door and hear a bubbling sound. You can detect no other noises and your Kai senses inform you that there are no persons present in the chamber beyond, so you carefully push open the door and slip inside.</p>
<p>The room beyond appears to be an alchemist’s workshop. Its many benches are crowded with flasks, and strange glass containers which are interconnected by a tangled mass of glass piping. Beakers of coloured fluids bubble over naked flames and the air is soured by a harsh, chemical stench.</p>
<p>Your eye is drawn to a rack of shelves that stretch along one wall. They are filled with hundreds of bottles and stoppered flasks, each one labelled and filled with powders, granules, fluids, or crystals. A cursory inspection of these containers reveals four potions with which you are familiar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potion of Gallowbrush (induces sleep for 1–2 hours per dose)</li>
<li>Graveweed Concentrate (fatal when swallowed)</li>
<li>Potion of Mokradon (causes irreversible blindness in humans)</li>
<li>Potion of Volzoc (causes violent hallucinations)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to take and keep any of these potions, record them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as Backpack Items.</p>
<p class="choice">Upon leaving this laboratory, you can go left and continue along the corridor, by <a href="sect173.htm">turning to 173</a>.</p>
