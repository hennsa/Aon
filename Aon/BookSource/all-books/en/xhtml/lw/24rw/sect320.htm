<h3>320</h3>

<p>Hulsta bids his wife a fond farewell and she, in turn, wishes you good luck and godspeed. During your absence she will make arrangements for your escape from Duadon to a place of safety. ‘May Ishir protect you both,’ she says, as she watches you descend the steps and walk across the yard to the rear gate.</p>
<p>Running along the back wall of Hulsta’s yard is an alleyway, one of a thousand such passages that weave around the main streets of Duadon like capillaries around veins. It is dark now, and the alleys are unlit, yet Hulsta leads you expertly through the maze of narrow passageways. Soon you arrive at the rear of a three-storey shop where Hulsta stops to peer over the rear wall.</p>
<p>‘This is the place I showed you on the plans,’ he whispers. ‘I came here three months ago to make sure that it’s still possible to get into the old tunnel from here. It is, although since then a problem has arisen. The shop has a new owner, a saddle-maker, and he is fiercely loyal to Vandyan. We must get into the cellar without his knowledge.’</p>
<p>Hulsta checks that the coast is clear, and then he climbs over the wall and unbolts the rear door to let you into the yard. You discover that the shop is closed; there are no lights and its solitary rear door is locked. Hulsta suspects that the owner has retired early to bed. You examine the door and detect that it is not bolted. It is secured by a simple mortise lock.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess a Dagger or a Spike, add 1 to the number you have picked. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Nexus, add 2.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 3 or lower, <a href="sect265.htm">turn to 265</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4–7, <a href="sect170.htm">turn to 170</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 8 or higher, <a href="sect89.htm">turn to 89</a>.</p>
