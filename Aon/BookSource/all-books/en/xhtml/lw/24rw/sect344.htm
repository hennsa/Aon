<h3>344</h3>

<p>The cellar is filled with the overpowering stench of tannic acid, a fluid used by the saddle-maker to convert his raw animal hides into leather. Hundreds of gallons are stored here in stout wooden casks that line the walls. Hulsta hurries past them to the southeast corner of the cellar where he drops to his knees. Carefully he places the lantern down on the floor and then he runs his hands lightly across the surface.</p>
<p>‘Ah, here it is!’ he says, locating something hidden beneath the dirt. He unsheathes a dagger and scrapes at the encrusted grime to reveal the outline of an old trapdoor. With your help, he prises open this hinged iron cover to reveal a dark shaft. You can hear the distant sound of water, and when Hulsta lowers his lantern into the opening, you see the floor of a passage less than eight feet below. ‘This is the tunnel,’ he says, excitedly. ‘It’s exactly as shown on the plans.’</p>
<p>Hulsta drops through the opening and you pass him the lantern. Then you enter the shaft and pull the trapdoor down behind you. It slams shut with a resounding <i>clang</i>.</p>
<p>This gloomy tunnel echoes to the far-off sound of rushing water and the occasional squeak of rats. Hulsta leads the way and you follow in his footsteps, taking care not to scrape your head against the low, mould-encrusted ceiling.</p>
