<h3>53</h3>

<p>In your rush to escape from the barn, you misjudge your jump and sprain your left ankle upon hitting the paved ground: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. You are unable to get back on your feet immediately, and you lose precious time when you are forced to use your innate Kai curing skills to repair your injured foot.</p>
<p>You are testing your weight on your ankle when suddenly you see the farmer’s son come rushing out of the barn. He has discarded his pitchfork and has taken up a sword which he waves menacingly above his head. You draw your Kai Weapon and warn him to stay back. He is young, untrained in combat, and he is certainly no match for a Kai Grand Master. The young man laughs when he hears your order to halt. He continues to advance. You warn him once more but he ignores you. Then, with a scream of anger, he rushes forward in a clumsy attempt to land a blow upon the side of your head.</p>
<p class="combat">Farmer’s Son: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 19   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 24</p>
<p>You have no wish to kill this young man and so you deliver all of your blows with the flat of your weapon’s blade in order to subdue, rather than wound, your adversary. Fight this combat in the normal way, but halve all <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point losses sustained by your enemy.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the fight, <a href="sect177.htm">turn to 177</a>.</p>
