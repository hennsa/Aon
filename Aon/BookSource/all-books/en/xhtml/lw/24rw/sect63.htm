<h3>63</h3>

<p>Drawing upon your advanced Kai skills, you focus on the Vorka and exude a powerful scent from the palms of your hands. This scent is abhorrent to the lizard-like creature and it causes it to shy away in disgust. It shrieks, and then it retreats towards the river where it joins with its brothers who are making short work of your provisions which they have just found hidden under the canvas.</p>
<p>The remaining Vorka suddenly detect the smell of the food and instantly they abandon their search and scurry down to the river. They arrive too late to share in the unexpected feast, and in frustration they vent their anger on the boat itself. You are taken aback by the sheer speed and ferocity of their attack which reduces your sailboat to matchwood.</p>
<p>Silently you watch the Vorka as they return to the bridge and cross once more to the other side. The incident seems to have excited the Eldenoran guards, and you can hear them laughing and cursing wildly. You decide to wait until their excitement has died down a little before you attempt to leave your hiding place. During your wait you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (you are unable to use Grand Huntmastery to forage for food in this instance).</p>
