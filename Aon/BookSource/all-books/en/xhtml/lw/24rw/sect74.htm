<h3>74</h3>

<p>Hastily you apologize to the sergeant and tell him that you are a balladeer, sent from Duadon by Lord Vandyan to entertain his troops garrisoned in Tekaro. On hearing this incredible tale, the sour-faced reeve and his men burst with laughter.</p>
<p>‘So you’re a songbird, eh?’ he coughs, incredulously. ‘Well, Master Songbird, why don’t you trill us a song to lift our weary hearts!’</p>
<p>Using your Grand Master skills, you give voice to a ballad extolling the virtues of the Eldenoran military police. The sergeant and his men are so mesmerized by your melodic voice that they relax and forget completely why it is they have stopped you. When your ballad is over, they cheer you and pat your horse’s flanks affectionately.</p>
<p>‘You’ve a fine voice, Master Songbird,’ says the sergeant, ‘and a honeyed way with words. You’ve cheered us, and that takes some doin’, I can tell ye. We’ll be looking forward to hearing you sing again before long. For now, you best be on your way.’ And with these words of praise the sergeant and his men step aside and allow you to ride on into the square.</p>
