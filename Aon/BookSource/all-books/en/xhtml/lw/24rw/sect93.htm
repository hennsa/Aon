<h3>93</h3>

<p>Through the gap in the velvet curtains you can see a large hall. It is ringed with marble pillars and its walls are draped with Eldenoran battle-flags. The centre of the hall is dominated by a large refectory table around which are huddled groups of Eldenoran officers. They are poring over charts and battle-maps which detail the positions of their Vorka hordes and the defensive lines of the Freeland armies.</p>
<p>You await your chance and then you slip out from behind the curtain when nobody is looking in your direction. There are several messengers travelling between the groups of officers, delivering and collecting orders, and nobody seems to pay you special attention as you move discreetly from one group to another and eavesdrop on their briefings.</p>
<p>You are listening to a conversation between two cavalry captains recently returned from the siege of Varetta, when suddenly there is a fanfare of trumpets. Immediately the officers and their aides cease all discussion and the hall comes stiffly to attention in anticipation of Lord Vandyan’s arrival.</p>
