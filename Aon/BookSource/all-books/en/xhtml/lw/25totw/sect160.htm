<h3>160</h3>

<p>Cautiously you approach the open archway and peer around its stone jamb. Beyond the tower entrance you can see a flagstoned plaza that is adjacent to the main gate. Here you see Hammerland bandits drawing pails of dirty grey water from a well by the south perimeter wall, and a dozen hungry Giaks squabbling over the gangrenous remains of a wolfhound carcass.</p>
<p>You scan the streets of this grim city-fortress and note that there are no individual dwellings here. The buildings of Gazad Helkona are grouped into four vast hexagonal blockhouse complexes, each topped by a cluster of minarets and spires. They are connected to one another by bridges that span the wide avenues between. At the centre of the stronghold is a massive octagonal citadel. A broad ramp leads to its portcullised gate which is guarded by a troop of fifty armoured sentries. As you observe the citadel, you sense a powerful concentration of evil lurking somewhere within its jet-black walls. Its highest level is dominated by a domed observatory which emits a pulsating crimson light. Your Sixth Sense tells you that Lone Wolf is being held captive somewhere within this edifice, and it hardens your resolve to rescue him.</p>

<p>Quickly you determine that the citadel gate is too heavily defended for you to dare risk entering by such a direct route. Instead, you resolve to get into this stronghold by one of the bridges that connect it to the surrounding blockhouse complexes. The nearest blockhouse is little more than 100 yards from the tower archway, and you can see two possible ways to enter. Iron doors are set flush into the wall of this rust-streaked edifice; one to the left of the archway, and one to the right.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the left door, <a href="sect263.htm">turn to 263</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to investigate the right door, <a href="sect306.htm">turn to 306</a>.</p>
