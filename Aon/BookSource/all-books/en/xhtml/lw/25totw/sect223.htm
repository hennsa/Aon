<h3>223</h3>

<p>Through the peephole you can see the central section of a large, torchlit chamber. Seated here around a refectory table are three swarthy bandits attired in mercenary garb. The eldest of the group gulps wine from a battered pewter goblet as he talks loudly with another who is polishing a rust-pitted sword.</p>
<p>You magnify your vision and see a short tunnel receding from an archway on the far side of this chamber. At its end you notice the gloomy grey light of the city pouring through a semicircular portal. You focus on this distant light and your pulse quickens when you are able to make out a section of a bridge that connects this blockhouse complex to the central citadel. You appear to have found a route to the citadel, but in order to reach it you must find a way past the bandits occupying the hall beyond. Carefully you push against the cold iron door and feel it move on its hinges; it is unlocked.</p>
