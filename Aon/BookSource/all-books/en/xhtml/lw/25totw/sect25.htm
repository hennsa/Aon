<h3>25</h3>

<p>With the element of surprise firmly on your side, you decide to launch a swift and sudden attack on the bandits in the hall beyond. You shoulder the heavy door wide open and burst into the hall with your Kai Weapon held ready to strike. With gasps of disbelief, the bandits scramble for their swords as they rise to meet your advance. The youngest of the trio is a sweaty-faced youth with lank ginger hair. He lunges at you with his rusty rapier but you sidestep his clumsy stroke with graceful ease. Then you retaliate with a thrust that pierces his thigh, and the youth grunts in agony as his leg buckles beneath him. With a flurry of vile curses, his two older comrades find their feet and come rushing to his aid, their swords slashing wildly at your head and chest.</p>
