<h3>252</h3>

<p>You scour the gallery in case the bandits were not alone, but the upper reaches of this hall are empty and you feel confident that your confrontation has not been witnessed. To avoid the risk of their bodies being discovered, you dispose of them by lifting each one onto your shoulder and heaving them over the balcony. They drop into the fiery pit that blazes in the hall below, and are quickly consumed by the flames. Then you hurry around the gallery to the staircase opposite.</p>
<p>Here you discover a short flight of iron steps that ascend to a long, low-ceilinged hall. This hall has plastered walls which are decorated with frescoes depicting enslaved humans, bedecked with chains and heads bowed in defeat, parading in a line before a triumphant group of Drakkarim warlords. At the far end of this hall you discover three identical doors recessed into the painted wall.</p>
