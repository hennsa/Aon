<h3>281</h3>

<p>You use your Magnakai power of Invisibility to contort your features so that your face takes on the hard and brutal countenance of a Drakkarim warrior. Then you raise the hood of your cloak and cover the Kai insignia that adorns its clasp. Boldly you stride towards the two bandits and they take a few uneasy steps backwards, fearing that you could be about to attack them.</p>
<p>‘Move that whining cur!’ you bark, cocking your thumb at their whimpering wolfhound, ‘or I’ll report you both to Xaol, you incompetent dolts!’</p>
<p>Your bold and convincing threat unnerves the two bandits, and they plead with you not to say anything to their master. Cringingly they apologize for their hound’s behaviour and promptly they drag him away. ‘Bah! Stupid fools!’ you growl, as you watch them enter the tunnel that leads to the exterior platform. Then as soon as they disappear from view, you turn and hurry around the gallery to the staircase opposite.</p>
<p>A short flight of iron steps ascends to a long, low-ceilinged hall. Its plastered walls are decorated with frescoes that depict enslaved humans, bedecked with chains and heads bowed in defeat, parading in a line before a triumphant group of Drakkarim warlords. At the far end of this hall you discover three identical doors recessed into the wall.</p>
