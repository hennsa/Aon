<h3>282</h3>

<p>Lord Rimoah wishes you good luck as you step into the boarding cage in readiness to be winched up to the flying ship. Banedon is waiting on the stern deck to meet you and together you wave farewell to Rimoah as <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> gets underway. Rapidly the monastery recedes from view as the ship ascends into the clouds and forges a course across the grey Durncrag Mountains. You retire with Banedon to his quarters where together you study his navigational charts. The Shezar Hills lie a thousand miles away on a southwesterly bearing, and Banedon anticipates your arrival there within twelve hours. During the voyage, Banedon recalls the year MS 5075 when he was abducted by Nadziranim sorcerers and imprisoned in the Darklord fortress of Kaag. Had it not been for Lone Wolf’s brave and determined effort to save him, he would have surely perished there. Although anxious about Lone Wolf’s abduction, Banedon is also grateful to have been given this chance to help you save his friend from a similar predicament. ‘The task you’ve undertaken will be difficult and dangerous,’ he says, ‘but I beseech you, Grand Master, not to forswear your vow to save your master.’ Readily you reassure Banedon of your iron resolve to rescue Lone Wolf, no matter what difficulties lie ahead.</p>
<p>It is shortly before dusk when <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> approaches its destination. This is a shallow valley at the northwestern edge of the Shezar Hills, close to its border with the petrified forest of Helkona. You heed the lookout’s cry and go up on deck to observe the sullen landscape from the port rail. Meanwhile, Banedon takes command of the ship’s helm in readiness for a landing. As the craft descends, you survey the surrounding deadlands with trepidation. To the west, beyond the barren hilltops, a dull orangey light glows amidst the dust-choked clouds, proclaiming the hour of sunset. There is a strong sulphurous smell, and the distant hiss and rumble of active volcanoes lend further menace to this bleak, inhospitable landscape.</p>
<p>Banedon brings <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> gently to earth where it settles into the smooth, dusty soil. As his crewmen busy themselves securing its anchorage, he helps you to disembark.</p>
<p>‘Godspeed and good fortune, Grand Master,’ he says, as you get ready to descend to the ground by ladder. ‘I shall await Lone Wolf’s signal with optimism. Remember, when you have freed your master, he must speak to me telepathically. Only when I have received his mental command shall I approach Gazad Helkona. I will bring <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> into the centre of the city-fortress and look for your signal. May Ishir protect you both.’</p>
<p>You heed Banedon’s words and bid him farewell before descending to the ground. Then, with a final wave, you turn and trek north across the barren valley floor. In the distance there is an undulating ridge of hills which lie between you and the petrified forest of Helkona. In order to reach your final destination, the fortress at the heart of this dead timberland, you must first traverse this range of hills. You stop for a few moments to observe the hills in the failing light and determine two places where you may be able to cross them. The first is a narrow gully that bisects the range, and the second is a winding, windswept trail that ascends to the peak.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to traverse the hills by way of the gully, <a href="sect87.htm">turn to 87</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to follow the winding trail to the crest of the ridge, <a href="sect304.htm">turn to 304</a>.</p>
