<h3>307</h3>

<p>The observatory platform is littered with chunks of rock and shattered glass. You peer over the parapet and, through the plume of grey smoke that is coiling up the shaft, you see that the lower landing no longer exists. Along with adjoining sections of the staircase, it has been transformed into a vast mound of rubble that lies heaped at the bottom of the shaft. The few enemy troops who have survived the explosion can no longer reach the observatory, but as you watch them attempting to recover the bodies of their fallen comrades, it crosses your mind that the explosion has also destroyed your only known exit from the roof.</p>
<p>You retreat from the parapet and resume your attempt to revive Lone Wolf. At first the signs are not good; his breathing is shallow and his skin has a sickly pallor. But then you notice that his eyes are moving beneath their closed lids and you sense that he is emerging from coma.</p>
