<h3>313</h3>

<p>Lone Wolf opens his eyes, and a faint smile creases his gaunt features when he sees your face looming before him.</p>
<p>‘So I’m still alive,’ he says, with a tone of gentle surprise. ‘Naar will be disappointed.’</p>
<p>He raises his arm and you take hold of it and help him rise unsteadily to his feet. He surveys the devastated observatory and you sense that his agile mind is scrutinizing every detail. He reaches for his scabbard and breathes a heavy sigh of relief when his hand closes around the hilt of the Sommerswerd.</p>
<p>‘I trust my blade found its mark?’ he asks.</p>
<p>‘Aye, my lord,’ you reply. ‘Your timely action consigned Zorkaan to oblivion, and saved my life. For that I will be forever in your debt.’</p>
<p>‘And I in yours, Grand Master,’ he replies, earnestly. ‘I sense that I would not be drawing breath now if it were not for your bravery.’</p>
<p>Hurriedly you inform your leader that Guildmaster Banedon and his flying ship are presently hidden in the Shezar Hills, awaiting his telepathic signal. Silently he acknowledges your words with a nod of his blond head, and then he closes his eyes. You sense rapid bursts of powerful psychic energy surging away from Lone Wolf and, moments later, he reopens his eyes and smiles.</p>
<p>‘It is done,’ he says, confidently. ‘Banedon will be here shortly. Come, we must prepare for his arrival.’</p>
