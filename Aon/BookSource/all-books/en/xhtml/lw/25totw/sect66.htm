<h3>66</h3>

<p>Hurriedly you drag the corpses of the dog and the Drakkarim into the dark alcove from where the Akataz first emerged. When you look around the floor of this shadowy niche, you discover a carpet of flea-infested sacking which you use to cover the bodies of your slain foes. Once they are hidden, you turn and hurry towards the stairs.</p>
<p>At the top of these steps you discover a wide balcony and a door banded by criss-crossing strips of enamelled iron. The door is ajar, and the grey half-light of Gazad Helkona filters through its opening to illuminate the gloom of an entrance hall that lies beyond. Cautiously you enter the hall and cast your eye over its dank walls and high ceiling.</p>
<p>The circular walls of this hall are bedecked with battered shields and torn banners, captured in battle during the Darklands War. Lit by the oily glow of a solitary sputtering Lantern, you can see a crude wooden table and two chairs in the middle of the hall. A pair of Bone Dice rests on the table and two Spears lie on the floor beside it. (If you want to keep any of these items, adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p>You are looking around the walls when you notice an archway directly opposite the main entrance, leading to a flight of stone steps. Quickly you cross to the archway and ascend the steps to a landing on the level above.</p>
