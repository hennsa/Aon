<h3>80</h3>

<p>Your Kai Weapon tumbles through the air and strikes the Urgaroh squarely in the chest. The force of the impact lifts the creature off its feet and sends it somersaulting backwards to land in a broken, untidy heap. As it struggles to wrench your blade from its chest, you rush forward and grab the hilt of your weapon, twist it, and drive it deeper into the foul beast to seal its doom. The Urgaroh shrieks in agony and rakes your arm with its claws (lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points). As you pull away, you tug your weapon from the Urgaroh’s chest and the creature emits a chilling scream. Then its body spontaneously ignites and burns fiercely, giving off a choking black smoke.</p>
<p>Above the noise of the wind that rushes through the shattered glass dome, you hear angry cries and the stomp of booted feet. The Drakkarim have regrouped and are storming the stairs once more, their numbers swelled by a score of Giaks and Hammerland bandits. Driven by instinct, you sheathe your Kai Weapon and pick up the Urgaroh’s crystal rod which lies near your feet; then you turn and rush to the head of the stairs. You can feel the evil power that is held within the rod’s slender shaft, but you are unsure how you may unleash it upon the enemy who are now racing up the stairs.</p>
