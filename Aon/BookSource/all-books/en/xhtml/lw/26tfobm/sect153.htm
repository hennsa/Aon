<h3>153</h3>

<p>You enter the cavern and make your way along a line of parked ore wagons, using them as cover as you stealthily approach the stone channel. The pitiful sounds of torture can be heard above the noise of the furnace, and the victim’s cries make your blood boil with anger. Your instinct is to attack his cruel tormentors and save him from the flames, but to do so would endanger the success of your vital mission, and so, reluctantly, you press on.</p>
<p>You reach the stone channel at the point where it crosses the wagon track, and you hide behind one of its supporting pillars. From here you can see that the exit from the cavern is open and unguarded. However, if you are to reach the mouth of this tunnel and escape from the cavern, you must first cross 20 yards of open ground in full view of a dozen Shom’zaa minions.</p>
