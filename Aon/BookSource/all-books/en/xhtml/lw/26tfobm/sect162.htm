<h3>162</h3>

<p>The lancers are shocked and confused by the mist that has suddenly appeared, and they lose all sense of direction when they pass through this dense white cloud. They emerge from it to crash headlong into the wheat at the northern edge of the clearing. Minutes later, you hear their terrified screams as they gallop into the blazing wall of fire.</p>
<p>You run towards the east and re-enter the tall crops at the edge of the clearing, and then carefully you skirt around the flames before continuing your trek northwards. Soon you come to a muddy ditch which marks the boundary between the wheat fields and a neighbouring crop of barley. The cereal plants here are shorter, and you are able to catch sight of the roof of a Drodarin farmhouse less than 50 yards ahead.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate this farmhouse, <a href="sect73.htm">turn to 73</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to avoid the farmhouse, <a href="sect37.htm">turn to 37</a>.</p>
