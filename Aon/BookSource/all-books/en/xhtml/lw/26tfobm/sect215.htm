<h3>215</h3>

<p>You take aim with your right hand at the two guards before uttering the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Net</i>. A gout of thick fluid gushes from your palm and engulfs the creatures, glueing them together with its sticky strands. They struggle to free themselves but, in their desperation, they fall over and become stuck firmly to the ground.</p>
<p>The dwarves seize their chance to escape from the cage. A hand reaches through the bars and the bolt is pulled. Then the door bursts open and out they pour with a blood-curdling yell as they run to the ore wagons to arm themselves with rocks and tools. The torturers, alerted by the dwarf-yell, abandon their grisly work and come running towards the prison cage with their weapons raised. Suddenly two of these minions appear beside your wagon. Hurriedly you reach to your Kai Weapon as they launch a frenzied attack.</p>
<p class="combat">Shom’zaa minions: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 33   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 38</p>
<p>You are unable to inflict any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> loss on this enemy for the first two rounds of combat, due to the surprise and ferocity of their attack.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect9.htm">turn to 9</a>.</p>
