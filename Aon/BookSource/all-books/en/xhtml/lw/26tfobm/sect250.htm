<h3>250</h3>

<p>The sounds of fighting grow louder as you explore the depths of this tunnel. Frequently you have to hide in the shadows to avoid colliding with ragged groups of wounded Agarashi retreating from battle. But at length you come to a large cavern that serves as the anteroom to the throne chamber of Andarin.</p>
<p>From the cover of a stone column beside the tunnel exit, you observe the deadly struggle that is taking place in this smoke-filled cavern. Scores of dead Agarashi are heaped before the entrance to the distant throne chamber. Its great double doors have been torn from their hinges, yet entry has been denied to the Shom’zaa horde. A barricade fills the open doorway, and this makeshift wall is being skilfully defended by the War-thanes of Prince Leomin and Prince Torfan.</p>
<p>An assault on the throne chamber is about to take place. You watch with grim fascination as the Agarashi rise up from positions they have dug around the perimeter of the cavern, and wait for their commander to shriek the order to attack. A wailing cry echoes around the cavern as the horde rushes headlong towards the barricade. They come to within a few paces of the wall before the leading ranks are obliterated by a cannon’s shell and a deafening volley of Bor pistols. There is a brief clash of swords and spears, followed by an ominous silence. From out of the smoke and carnage, the few who have survived the attack come crawling back to their trenches to lick their wounds and await the next assault.</p>
<p>Soon you hear the approach of enemy reinforcements, their ill-fitting armour rattling as they come running along the tunnel. You are forced to move away from the column for fear of being seen when they arrive but, as you scurry to the cover of an empty powder barrel, you are spotted by a group of Shom’zaa minions in a trench near the cavern wall. They cry out to their comrades, alerting them of your presence as they fumble to load their captured crossbows.</p>
