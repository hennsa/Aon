<h3>293</h3>

<p>You draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus and focus this power upon a large, oil-filled lantern which hangs directly above the platform. By the power of your will alone, you attempt to cause the lantern to tilt and spill some of its blazing fuel onto the kegs below.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the creature on the platform senses you, and it emits a hellish shriek. A fiery pain wells up inside your skull as this servant of Shom’zaa launches a powerful stream of destructive psychic blasts at your mind. Rapidly the pressure builds in your head until your skull feels fit to burst. Your vision is clouded by a scarlet haze, and you are unable to stifle a cry of pain as you are brought to your knees: lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Desperately you struggle to erect a defensive wall around the core of your mind, using your power of Psi-screen. Slowly, as your mental defences lock together, the pain eases and your vision clears. Through the receding red mist you see a group of Shom’zaa Agarashi closing in on you with their swords drawn. You force yourself to stand, and you unsheathe your Kai Weapon just in time to meet their determined attack.</p>
<p class="combat">Shom’zaa Agarashi: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 40   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 30</p>
