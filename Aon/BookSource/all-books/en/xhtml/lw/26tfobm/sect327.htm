<h3>327</h3>

<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense warns you that a large group of Shom’zaa Agarashi are approaching, and your Magnakai Discipline of Divination detects the presence of a creature among them who possesses magical abilities. A cursory look in the opposite direction tells you that this smooth-walled, lantern-lit passage offers very few places in which to hide. Having coolly assessed the situation, you call upon your improved mastery of Nexus to help you survive it.</p>
<p>You curl up on the floor and cover your head with your left arm to keep your Sommlending features hidden from view. Then you place yourself into a state of suspended animation, convincingly feigning death. Minutes later, a dozen Shom’zaa Agarashi come creeping along the tunnel. They are led by a thin creature with ebony skin and iridescent eyes. Without paying you a second glance, they pass by and disappear into the distance.</p>
<p>When you can no longer hear the rasping sound of their clawed feet scraping the tunnel floor, you bring yourself out of the trance and get to your feet.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the bodies that are lying in this tunnel, <a href="sect144.htm">turn to 144</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to explore the tunnel further, <a href="sect160.htm">turn to 160</a>.</p>
