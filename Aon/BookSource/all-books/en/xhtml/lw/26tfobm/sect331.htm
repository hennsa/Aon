<h3>331</h3>

<p>The Sun-crystal hits the rocky tip of the stalagmite and is deflected away from Shom’zaa’s head. Your heart sinks as you watch the glowing crystal bounce off a cluster of grey egg sacs, and then splash into the shallow slime that covers the floor.</p>
<p>You are gripped by the sudden fear that you may have lost the only weapon capable of destroying Shom’zaa, and hurriedly you leap off the stone ramp and race to retrieve it. Your Kai Sixth Sense guides you directly to its location, but as you pluck it from the slime and turn to face Shom’zaa’s hiding place, suddenly you recall Lord Rimoah’s words of warning. You must not be too close to the creature when the Sun-crystal touches his body, or you will risk being consumed when the crystal’s energy is released.</p>
<p>The memory of his wise words makes you pause and reconsider your actions. You focus on the stalagmite, now little more than 10 feet away, and you sense that something is very wrong. You look again, and the glimpse that you can see of Shom’zaa’s head begins to shimmer and fade. Your throat tightens when you realize that you have been duped by an illusion. As you turn back towards the ramp, you are suddenly struck in the back by a terrific force.</p>
