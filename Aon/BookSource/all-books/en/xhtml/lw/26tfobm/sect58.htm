<h3>58</h3>

<p>Your vision swims in and out of focus as you stagger drunkenly to your feet. Drawing upon your Magnakai curing skills, you staunch the flow of blood that is trickling into your eyes from your wounded scalp. As your sight clears, you see Captain Vagel lying trapped beneath the overturned chariot. Arrows thud into the ground as you scramble to his side and attempt to drag him free. But your valiant effort is in vain; he is mortally injured and close to death. You place your hands upon his chest and use your healing skills in a final effort to save his life. Briefly he responds. His eyelids flicker open and he raises a broken hand to point towards the north wall of the quarry.</p>
<p>‘Go that way … throne chamber … ten miles … ’ he gasps. These are his final words.</p>
<p>You magnify your vision and see the entrance to a vertical pit shaft located at the base of the quarry wall. It is partially hidden by a heap of sawn timbers.</p>
