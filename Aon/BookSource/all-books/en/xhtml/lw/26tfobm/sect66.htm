<h3>66</h3>

<p>By the use of your improved mastery of Assimilance, you are able to create a thunderous sound and project it directly above the heads of the Shom’zaa Agarashi guards. Fearing that the roof of the cavern is about to collapse upon them, they drop their spears and dive for the shelter of the tunnel. As they hit the ground, you leave the shadows and set off towards the archway at a run, building speed rapidly as you draw closer. With a mighty leap you clear their bodies and land in the cavern beyond.</p>
<p>Without looking back, you scramble to your feet and race towards the barricade. You are halfway across the chamber when, to your surprise and relief, you note that the only Shom’zaa minions who now occupy this hall are those lying dead on the ground around you. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that you are no longer in any immediate danger, and so you slow your pace as you approach the barricade.</p>
