<h3>97</h3>

<p>The icy bolt is deflected by the wall of hot air, but it strikes your legs and inflicts severe frostbite to your calves and feet: lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus thaws your frozen limbs and saves you from sustaining permanent damage to your feet and toes, but you are unable to move your legs effectively and you topple backwards to the ground.</p>
<p>Before the Shom’zaa Agarashi can rally themselves and attack you while you lie helpless upon the floor, you crawl away into a section of the vast laboratory that is crowded with siege machinery and engines of war. Here you take cover behind a large shield on wheels and observe the enemy milling in confusion. While you are watching them, you use your Kai healing skills to restore all feeling to your frost-numbed feet.</p>
<p>Suddenly their commander galvanizes their attention by freezing two luckless minions to death with another icy blast. When he then commands the portcullis to be lowered to prevent you from escaping, a zealous Agarashi rushes forward and begins hacking at its securing rope with a battle-axe. The rope snaps, and you watch with horror as the portcullis comes crashing down to seal off the exit.</p>
