<h3>100</h3>

<p>Shortly after dark, you and your companions make your approach to the river bank a mile upstream from the stone bridge. The rangers have tied their ropes together to provide a length that will reach to the opposite bank. The plan is for you to swim across and secure the rope on the far side. The rangers will then follow you across, using the rope to prevent themselves from being swept away by the strong currents.</p>
<p>You tie the rope about your waist and wade into the cold dark river. Then you strike out for the opposite bank, swimming diagonally upstream to counter its swift flow. You are halfway across when your rope snags on something below the surface. Furiously you tug at it but to no avail. Then you see a glistening mound begin to rise up from the water. Two slits open, revealing the pupils of two monstrous eyes. Then a wider slit appears below them, filled with jagged fangs. Your rope disappears into the corner of this ghastly maw, and as the mouth opens and closes, so you are pulled ever closer to these deadly fangs.</p>
