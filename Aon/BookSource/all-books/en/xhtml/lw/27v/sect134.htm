<h3>134</h3>

<p>You tell your companions to raise the hoods of their robes to keep their faces hidden, and then you beckon them to follow as you approach the rear of a canvas-covered wagon that is queueing outside the main entrance. Swiftly you clamber over its tailgate and hide yourselves among its load. Several minutes later, the wagon begins to move. You tear a hole in its canvas cover through which you can see the inner buildings of the barracks complex as they pass. The wagon trundles along a passageway towards a parade square, beyond which lies its final destination—the kitchen store rooms. You clamber to the rear of the wagon and crouch beside the tailgate. Then, at the moment the vehicle emerges from the passageway, you signal to your companions to leave. One after the other, you leap from the back of the moving wagon.</p>
