<h3>136</h3>

<p>You follow Gildas and the others as they climb a wide flight of spiral stairs to the top of the tower. As you ascend, lanterns set at intervals in the wall spontaneously ignite, bathing the stone steps with a warm, yellow light. A sumptuous chamber occupies the top floor of the tower. By the time you arrive there, its many lanterns are aglow, and its great log fire is blazing warmly in the grate. The light and heat make for a welcoming arrival, but they give a false impression. Dust lies thickly on the surfaces of every bookshelf, table, and chair. This chamber is well appointed, but it has lain neglected for more than a year.</p>
<p>One entire half of the great circular room is dominated by a huge latticed window, through which you can see every rooftop in Zuda. You hurry across the chamber and peer down through the glass at the courtyard below. It is teeming with Bhanarians and you fear that they now have you trapped like rats in a very comfortable cage. You raise your eyes and look towards the market square. The Autarch’s tent can clearly be seen, with the tiger’s-head shrine standing near. You see its head slowly rotating towards the tower. In the next instant, two pencil-thin beams of red light come shooting from its eyes. Before you can look away, they hit the window, and you are blinded by their terrific glare.</p>
