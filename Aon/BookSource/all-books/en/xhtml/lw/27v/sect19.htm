<h3>19</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, your ploy fails. The squad leader overhears you and he raises the alarm. Suddenly the door to the antechamber is kicked open and a dozen soldiers burst in, armed and eager to protect their esteemed commander.</p>
<p>You fight bravely and slay most of those who attack you, but the antechamber is soon awash with reinforcements and you are forced to surrender. During the mêlée, the rangers are also captured, and together you are taken before the Sergeant of the Guard. He denounces you as would-be thieves, out to steal provisions, and he orders that your weapons and equipment be confiscated before you are led away and thrown into the dungeons.</p>
<p>As the heavy door to your cell slams shut, you immediately look for a way out of this grim prison chamber. You try to pick the lock, but your attempt is thwarted when the sergeant and his guards return. With them is the squad leader, freshly bathed and sporting a fine new uniform. He is carrying the Claw of Naar, and when the iron door is opened, he points it at you and triggers a fearsome blast of raw energy. In the cramped confines of the cell there is no hope of escaping from its terrible power. In the blink of an eye, you and your brave companions are engulfed and consumed by a terrifying ball of white-hot fire.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your mission end here in the barracks dungeon of Yua Tzhan.</p>
