<h3>219</h3>

<p>You smash the head of the Claw against the floor to remove the burning log, and then tuck the artefact in your belt. Below, you can hear the door to the tower being blown off its hinges and an old fear returns to chill your blood. The Autarch’s guards are storming up the stairs; it is only a matter of seconds before they will enter the chamber. Your instincts tell you to save your unconscious companions, but your rational mind tells you that this is now impossible; there is only time enough to save yourself. You bid them a sad farewell as you run towards the open window and leap out onto the platform of the Autarch’s sky-chariot. Below, you glimpse the Imperial Guards gathered around the body of the Autarch. To your amazement, you see that they are helping their leader to his feet. Sejanoz is still alive.</p>
<p>Quickly you look to the controls of the sky-chariot and they seem vaguely familiar. They are similar in design and purpose to those found at the helm of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>, albeit on a smaller, simpler scale. You place your right hand on a sparkling sphere, but as you are pushing it forwards to make the chariot advance, a handful of the Imperial Guards in the courtyard below fire a volley of projectiles at you.</p>
<p>The Autarch has given the order; he is determined not to let you get away.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Assimilance, add 2 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 0, <a href="sect123.htm">turn to 123</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 1–3, <a href="sect254.htm">turn to 254</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4–7, <a href="sect300.htm">turn to 300</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 8 or higher, <a href="sect192.htm">turn to 192</a>.</p>
