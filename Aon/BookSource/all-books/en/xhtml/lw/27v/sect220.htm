<h3>220</h3>

<p>Quickly you return to Captain Gildas and discover that Ranger Durasso has been killed, and Sergeant Paviz badly wounded by the Claw’s second blast of power. You use your Kai healing skills to staunch the flow of blood from the sergeant’s wounded arm, and then you scan the trail leading south from the pass for signs of the escaping enemy squad. In the failing light you glimpse their black-clad forms hurrying away along the trail which heads towards the Bhanarian Plain.</p>
<p>Gildas and his rangers are too shaken to attempt an immediate pursuit and so you allow them to rest and recover their strength. When you cast your eye towards the ravine where <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> was hidden, before it was attacked by the flying horde, your Sixth Sense suddenly informs you that there is something waiting for you there.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect13.htm">turn to 13</a>.</p>
