<h3>226</h3>

<p>You retreat before the advancing Imperial Guardsmen until your backs are pressed against the base of the crimson tower. Gildas calls for you to look behind, and when you glance over your shoulder, you see that there is a red door set flush into the tower wall. Forcefully you push the door but it will not open. Then you notice a dial set in the middle of its surface, and in the centre of the dial is a small keyhole. The rangers load their bows and fire repeatedly at the advancing guardsmen as you attempt to unlock the door to the crimson tower.</p>
<p>The dial is surrounded by numerals numbering from 0 to 100. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you determine that by turning the dial to one of these numbers, you will cause the lock to disengage and the door will open.</p>
<p>While examining the dial, you recall the wall safe in the barracks at Yua Tzhan. That lock required 3 digits to open it. This requires only one. The number that will open this lock is equal to the total you get when you add together the three digits that opened the wall safe.</p>
<p class="puzzle">When you think you know the answer, <a href="numbered.htm">turn to the section of this book</a> which is the same as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect226-1-foot" name="sect226-1">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you are unable to determine the correct solution, <a href="sect244.htm">turn instead to 244</a>.</p>
