<h3>228</h3>

<p>You are dismayed that your attempt to destroy the Claw has failed, yet you refuse to abandon all hope of ridding your world of this evil artefact. You resolve to deliver it to the Elder Magi, for you know that it is within their power to obliterate this weapon of darkness.</p>
<p>Captain Gildas consoles you, and from a pocket of his tunic he produces a small crimson gemstone which he cups in his palm, inviting your inspection. Without saying a word, he fixes this gem into one of the hollows in the shaft of the Claw, and then he hands you a seemingly ordinary compass.</p>
<p>‘Look at the compass needle, Sir Kai,’ he says, and he picks up the Claw and begins to walk. As he circles around you, the point of the needle follows his every move.</p>
<p>‘It’s a Siyenese tracker-gem,’ he says. ‘The needle of the compass is tuned to its vibrations. It’s just a precaution, in case you should be parted from the Claw before you deliver it to the Elder Magi. So long as the gem remains embedded in its shaft, you’ll be able to track it using the compass.’ Gildas hands you the Claw and you compliment him for his prudence.</p>
<p>‘A very wise precaution, Captain,’ you say, as you slip the compass into your tunic pocket. ‘Somehow I feel sure that we have not yet seen the last of the Autarch’s squad.’</p>
<p>(You can record the Siyenese Compass on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You should also record the Claw of Naar as a Special Item. You must discard two items in their favour if you already have the maximum number of Special Items permissible.)</p>
<p>You sheathe your Kai Weapon and follow Gildas as he returns to the horses. As you walk towards them, Ranger Yalin beckons you over to look at a strange shrub that is growing near the ruins.</p>
