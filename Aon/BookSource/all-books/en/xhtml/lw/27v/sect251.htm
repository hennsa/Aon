<h3>251</h3>

<p>You call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Invisibility for protection, and then you command Captain Gildas and his rangers to wait while you go in search of the squad leader. You suspect that he may be one of the two warriors who have been killed by the rockfall. Mindful that the Claw of Naar was sheathed in his belt, you are determined to seize this opportunity to capture it before the dazed Bhanarians can recover their senses and regroup.</p>
<p>You swiftly traverse the mound of rocks that now blocks the pass, and as you leap onto the trail beyond, you note that neither of the slain warriors is the leader. Then you notice a drainage channel which runs alongside the mountain trail, and your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that the leader has escaped the rockfall by rolling into this trench. Without a moment’s hesitation, you unsheathe your Kai Weapon and jump into the trench after him.</p>
<p>As your feet hit the bottom of this shallow gully, you see your adversary standing less than 2 yards away. For a moment you stare at each other in shocked silence; then the almond-eyed warrior tugs the mace-like Claw of Naar from his belt and levels its taloned tip at your chest. There is a crackling hum of power and a terrifying bolt of black fire leaps from the tip and comes streaking towards your body.</p>
