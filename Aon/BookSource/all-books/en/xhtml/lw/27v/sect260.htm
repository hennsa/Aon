<h3>260</h3>

<p>The squad leader gasps with shock when he sees you come walking into his chamber. He glances to a knotted rope that is hanging beside the blazing fireplace, but it is just beyond reach. You detect that the rope is connected to an alarm bell, and you shake your head as a warning to him not to try to make a grab for it.</p>
<p>‘Where is the Claw?’ you say, raising your Kai Weapon to reinforce your demand. The sallow-skinned man narrows his eyes until they become like slits in his face, and he shakes his head slowly from side to side. He refuses to answer your question.</p>
<p>Suddenly he reaches over the side of his bath tub and attempts to grab something that is lying on the floor, hidden from view.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to rush forward and strike the squad leader with your Kai Weapon, <a href="sect107.htm">turn to 107</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to rush forward and tip him out of his bath tub, <a href="sect169.htm">turn to 169</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to throw your Kai Weapon at the squad leader, <a href="sect89.htm">turn to 89</a>.</p>
