<h3>273</h3>

<p>You stable your horses and enter the taproom of the Prairie Princess. As the door creaks open, a gust of ale-soaked air and the jingle of bells interrupt the hubbub. The denizens of this tavern cast your party a suspicious glance or two, and then they return to their conversations. The innkeeper approaches, wending his way nimbly through the closely-packed tables. He is a lean man with dark skin and a shaven head. You ask the cost of stabling and add that you shall not be requiring rooms for the night.</p>
<p>‘Seven Ren each,’ he says, brusquely. ‘You can pay tomorrow when you collect your nags.’</p>
<p>You turn to leave the crowded taproom, but your way to the door is blocked by a stout, one-eyed man with a roughly-trimmed beard. ‘You plains-nomads have got some nerve t’come in here,’ he spits. ‘You swindled me, near on stole all my herd o’ stallions. Well, I vowed I’d make you pay and now I’m going to collect!’</p>
<p>With a flick of his hand he signals to his cohorts to bar the tavern door. You tell the man that he is mistaken, that he is confusing you for somebody else, but he pays no heed to your explanation.</p>
