<h3>30</h3>

<p>As the dust settles, you see that the avalanche of rocks has blocked the mountain pass. Two of the enemy warriors have been crushed by the deluge, and three others can be seen staggering away wounded. Most of the squad appear to have survived the rockfall and you cannot help but begrudgingly admire the swiftness of their reactions. At first you cannot see their leader; then you notice him crawling along a channel which runs alongside the mountain trail. He jumped into this shallow gully to avoid the tumbling rocks and now he is climbing back towards the track.</p>
<p>You command Captain Gildas and his rangers to cover you as you leave your hiding place and go after this squad leader. He is clutching the Claw of Naar in his right hand and you are determined to seize the chance to capture it before he can rally his scattered men. Swiftly you traverse the mound of rocks that now blocks the pass, and as you leap into the gully behind the squad leader, you draw your Kai Weapon in readiness to strike. Your adversary hears the slick swish of your weapon leaving its scabbard and instantly he spins on his heel. Shock blanches his sallow, moustachioed face and his almond eyes widen with alarm, but he quickly recovers his composure.</p>
<p>He raises the mace-like Claw of Naar defensively and, with a terse laugh, he levels its taloned tip at your chest. There is a crackling hum of power and a bolt of black fire leaps from this evil artefact. You act on reflex and dive to the bottom of the trench as the supernatural bolt of dark flame comes streaking through the dusty air towards you.</p>
