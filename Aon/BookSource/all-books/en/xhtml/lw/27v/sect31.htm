<h3>31</h3>

<p>Only the swiftness of your reactions saves you and your companions from a watery death. You race back along the hill road, through the blinding rain, with a surging torrent of mud and debris chasing you all the way. Trees are uprooted and loose boulders are sent hurtling into the air by the destructive force of this merciless flow. You are struck by pieces of debris and you suffer cuts to your head and back: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>You succeed in outrunning the mudsling but at some cost. Your horses are so drained by the ordeal that two of them die of exhaustion, and a third becomes too lame to continue. You are forced to abandon them and continue your journey on foot. You head east, and take shelter on a wooded hillside while you wait for the rains to abate.</p>
<p>While you are resting, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect59.htm">turn to 59</a>.</p>
