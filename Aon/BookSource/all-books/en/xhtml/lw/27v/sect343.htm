<h3>343</h3>

<p>The old man is deeply hurt by your refusal to take bread and wine with him. It is considered a grave insult in Bhanar to refuse such basic hospitality. Some of the young men who have gathered outside the tent to watch you now begin to reach for their daggers. Anxious to avoid any needless bloodshed, Captain Gildas intervenes and accepts the old man’s offer on your behalf. ‘He’s a Northlander,’ he says, by way of an apology on your behalf. ‘He knows nothing of your customs.’</p>
<p>The old man smiles and nods his head, and then he invites you all to come into his tent. You dismount, and the children look after your horses while you file into his spacious dwelling. He gives each of you a glass of mulled wine and a piece of unleavened bread, and while you are enjoying this plain fare, he invites you to examine the wares and trinkets which lie strewn about his tent.</p>
<p>Gildas nudges you and points to a rickety table that is heaped with simple straw-coloured robes, much favoured by Bhanarian plainsmen. ‘These may be a wise investment, Sir Kai?’ he mutters. ‘I fear our tunics may arouse suspicion the further south we venture.’</p>
<p>You nod in agreement and ask the old man how much he wants for four of his robes.</p>
<p>‘One hundred and sixty Ren, kind sir,’ he replies, cheerfully.</p>
<p>The old man’s price is equivalent to 16 Gold Crowns. The rangers do not have any money, so if you wish to purchase these garments you must pay the full price.</p>
<p class="choice">If you can afford to pay the man’s price, <a href="sect286.htm">turn to 286</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not have sufficient Gold Crowns to pay for the robes, <a href="sect45.htm">turn to 45</a>.</p>
