<h3>4</h3>

<p>Upon your safe return, you tell Paviz and Yalin of what you observed at the copse.</p>
<p>‘They’re unaware we’ve caught up with them,’ says Captain Gildas, smiling slyly.</p>
<p>‘Yes, and we must exploit our advantage to the full,’ you reply. ‘You and your men must untie their horses and scatter them so that they cannot pursue us when I snatch the Claw of Naar, literally, from beneath their leader’s nose.’</p>
<p>The rangers approve of your plan and they are eager to put it into action. Gildas and his men mount up and skirt around the copse in a wide arc until they are in position on the far side, within sight of the enemy’s unguarded mounts. They take your horse in tow, for your plan is to rejoin them and make a speedy escape as soon as you have retrieved the Claw. Meanwhile, you approach the copse and halt within sight of the campfire. Only one of the Imperial Guardsmen is still awake, and although he has been posted to stand watch, you see that he is having difficulty keeping his eyes open. The squad leader is tossing and turning in his sleep, as if he is having a bad dream, and as you inch closer to him you fear that he could awaken at any moment.</p>
