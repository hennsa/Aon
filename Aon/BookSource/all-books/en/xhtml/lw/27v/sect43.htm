<h3>43</h3>

<p>The squad leader advances along the trench with the Claw of Naar poised to fire a second blast, yet a timely volley of arrows from the rangers forces him to abandon his attack and dive for cover. When he scrambles to his feet, he commands his scattered squad to rally to his cry. They come running forward and he scrambles out of the trench to meet them. Then an arrow skewers the sleeve of his tunic, and he spins around and looses off the second flame-bolt in reply. It explodes among the rocks above and you hear Sergeant Paviz cry out in pain. The crackling hum of the Claw rises to an almost deafening pitch when the leader allows the supernatural weapon to recharge to maximum power. Turning towards the rocks that block the mountain pass, he points the Claw at the base and lets loose a third blast of dark flame which blows a big hole in the heaped debris. With a wild cheer, the Bhanarians race through the smouldering gap and make good their escape along the trail beyond.</p>
