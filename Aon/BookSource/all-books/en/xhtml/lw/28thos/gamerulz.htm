<h2>The Game Rules</h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>) and physical stamina (<span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of 32). When you fight, your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21–27), you can carry your current scores of <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points over to this adventure.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">2</a></sup> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

<p>[<a name="gamerulz-1-foot" href="#gamerulz-1">2</a>] If you have completed any previous <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventures, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add +1 to your basic <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and +2 to your basic <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> for each adventure you successfully completed (cf. <a href="discplnz.htm">Grand Master Disciplines</a>).</p></div>
