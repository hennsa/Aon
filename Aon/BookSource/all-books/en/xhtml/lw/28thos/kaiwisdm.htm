<h2>New Order Wisdom</h2>

<p>Grand Master, you are about to embark upon a difficult and dangerous mission. The aged Khea-khan of Chai is one of Sommerlund’s oldest and most venerable allies. He is physically frail, yet he is revered almost like a god by his loyal subjects. Only he can rally the New Kingdoms to rise up and defy the mighty armies of Autarch Sejanoz. He must be escorted swiftly and safely to Tazhan, for if he is captured or slain by the enemy then all hopes for peace in Southern Magnamund will be dashed.</p>
<p>During your mission you may encounter many strong and wily adversaries. Your journey across the Great Lissan Plain will be fraught with danger at every turn, so remain on your guard at all times.</p>
<p>Some of the material items that you find will be of use to you, but others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items during your mission, be selective in what you choose to keep. Pick your initial five Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1–27) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>
<p>May the Gods Kai and Ishir guide and protect you during your vital mission.</p>
<p>For Sommerlund and the Kai!</p>
