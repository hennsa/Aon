<p>An electric hum fills the throne room of the Khea-khan’s palace as the chosen courtiers and guards make swift preparation for the evacuation to Tazhan. In the midst of all this frantic activity, the aged ruler of Chai sits upon his ebony throne and confers with his trusted advisor, Kau-Doshin, the head of the Imperial Palace household. The lines etched deeply upon their faces convey the gravity of the hushed words that pass between them.</p>
<p>In a far corner of the chamber you see Princess Mitzu consoling her tearful son, the five-year-old Prince Kamada. He is the Khea-khan’s great-great-grandson, and he is next in line to rule Chai upon the death of venerable Xo-lin. Having comforted him and dried his tears, Princess Mitzu places the young boy into the charge of his matronly tutor, Shavane. Then Mitzu leaves the throne room, passing by Guard Captain Chan who is entering through its grand arched doorway. Dutifully, he clicks his heels and salutes as the Princess glides past him with regal grace.</p>
<p>Chan scans the throne room and narrows his sharp almond eyes when he catches sight of you. The Guard Captain will be responsible for the personal safety of the Imperial Family during the overland journey to Tazhan, and as he strides across the throne room towards you, it is easy to see why this élite warrior has been entrusted with such an unenviable task.</p>
<p>‘Hail, Grand Master,’ he booms in greeting. ‘It pleases me greatly that you have chosen to accompany us to Tazhan. I welcome your valued assistance.’</p>
<p>You return Chan’s formal compliment and then ask him when the Imperial Caravan will be leaving.</p>
<p>‘Within the hour, my lord,’ he replies. He pauses to wipe away a trickle of sweat from the brow of his wide oval head, and then he says in a quieter tone: ‘I see you possess a fine Kai blade.’ His eyes glitter as he looks upon the Kai Weapon that is sheathed at your side. ‘As you can see, I am myself unarmed. Before we depart I must visit the Imperial Palace Armoury and equip myself. Would you care to accompany me? I trust you’ll be impressed by the quality of Chai weaponry, and you’ll be very welcome to take any item you find desirable.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accompany Captain Chan on a visit to the Imperial Palace Armoury, <a href="sect237.htm">turn to 237</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to decline his offer, <a href="sect187.htm">turn to 187</a>.</p>
