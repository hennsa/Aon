<h3>104</h3>

<p>You have heard of Xi-die but you are not familiar with their use. As you are examining them, a sallow-skinned guard sergeant leans forward and tugs at your sleeve. Smiling at his impatience, you pass him the dice and hurriedly he breathes on them before casting them to the ground.</p>
<p>When he and his companions look to you to interpret his throw, you can only shrug your shoulders and apologize for not being able to read them. The greasy-faced trooper frowns with disappointment as he snatches up the dice and returns them to Captain Chan. The sergeant mutters something under his breath, and you sense that his respect for you has been badly shaken.</p>
