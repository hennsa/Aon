<h3>150</h3>

<p>You step away from the bodies of the Bhanarians and look to the flag-tower. There you see Sergeant Yeng at the parapet. He gives you a thumbs-up signal to confirm that you have now taken control of the enemy command post. You hurry to the tower and meet Yeng at the foot of its wooden ladder.</p>
<p>‘Go and round up some horses, Sergeant,’ you say and he acknowledges your order with a salute.</p>
<p>Quickly you ascend to the top of the platform and peer over the parapet to see Sergeant Yeng and the others gathering up enemy horses so that you can make a speedy escape. You pick up the signalman’s flags and issue an urgent order to the attacking troops to withdraw immediately. As soon as you see that the enemy have obeyed your command signal, you look out across the plain towards the west. A smile spreads slowly across your face when you see Captain Chan is leading the caravan at speed towards Fort Vlau. Hurriedly you descend the flag-tower and join Yeng and his troopers. You leap into the saddle of a Bhanarian steed and dig in your heels, sending the mount lurching forwards. With the warm summer wind blowing in your faces, you and your brave comrades gallop across the plain to rendezvous with the caravan at Fort Vlau.</p>
