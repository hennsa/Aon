<h3>248</h3>

<p>‘I would be honoured,’ you reply.</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ says Chan, ‘if you are ready, I shall escort you to her quarters at once.’</p>
<p>Chan takes you into the chateau and leads you through its myriad corridors to a room on the first floor. A trooper whom you recognize opens the door and steps aside to allow you both entry. The chamber beyond is lavishly furnished, and the sweet smell of a rare burning incense hangs in the air. In a far corner you see the young Prince Kamada. He is asleep on a silken divan and is being watched over by his tutor Shavane, who is reading a book. His mother, the Princess, is seated at a table near a balcony window that overlooks the torchlit courtyard. You exchange polite greetings and then Chan excuses himself.</p>
<p>‘I shall be outside your door if you should need me, your majesty,’ he says, and promptly departs. As soon as he has gone, Princess Mitzu invites you to sit with her. She is anxious to know what fate has in store for her young son, and she asks if you will use your astrological skills to help her.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have reached the rank of Sun Knight, <a href="sect62.htm">turn to 62</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender and possess the Xi-die, <a href="sect126.htm">turn to 126</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have yet to attain either of these levels of Kai Mastery, or if you do not possess this Special Item, <a href="sect5.htm">turn instead to 5</a>.</p>
