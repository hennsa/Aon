<h3>255</h3>

<p>Sergeant Yeng and his scouts are pleased that you have chosen to join them, and together you set off towards the distant plains settlement. It feels good to have a cooling breeze blowing through your hair after the plodding pace you have been forced to maintain while riding with the caravan train.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the village give a cheerful wave as you ride through their humble hamlet. You keep your horses to a swift pace along the road beyond, and within the hour you catch sight of the Javai Forest on the horizon. Yeng gives the order to halt and you magnify your vision in order to get a better view of the distant tree-line. You can see the densely-packed pines, and the tall plains grasses swaying in the breeze. It is a pleasant but not a welcoming sight, for you know that both the trees and the tall grasses could provide ideal cover for ambushers.</p>
<p>You are unable to detect anything unusual in the distant forest, yet your Kai Sixth Sense is warning you of imminent danger.</p>
