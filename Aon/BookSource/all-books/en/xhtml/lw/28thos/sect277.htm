<h3>277</h3>

<p>Chan heeds your command and he issues a bold counter-threat to Kronar and his cohort.</p>
<p>‘Let our caravan pass … or your brother dies!’ Chan tugs on the trailing rope and Xango’s head jerks back. Trembling with fear, the prisoner pleads with his brother to do as Chan commands.</p>
<p>The renegade Kronar hesitates, and then he and his companion lower their bows. Chan signals to the caravan to come forward and you wait patiently until all of the carriages have passed by the wooded rise. Then Chan unwinds the end of his captive’s rope from his saddle and cracks it against the horse’s rump, making Xango’s mount lurch forward with a start. As the startled animal carries Xango away towards the wooded rise, you shout to Chan to follow the caravan. Together you dig in your heels and spur your horses to the gallop. As you race along the highway in pursuit of the caravan train, your stomach churns when you hear the unmistakable whistle of arrows in flight.</p>
