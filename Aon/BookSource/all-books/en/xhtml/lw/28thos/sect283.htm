<h3>283</h3>

<p>Captain Chan informs Bazan that he has something confidential to impart. The nomad chief gives him a knowing look, and then he claps his hands three times. Instantly his troupe of entertainers cease their activities and file out of the tent. When you are alone, Chan tells the nomad that the Khea-khan and his family are sitting in the carriages outside. Bazan is both surprised and delighted to hear this revelation, and he assures you that Xo-lin’s safety will be of paramount concern while the ruler is here as his guest.</p>
<p>Bazan summons his bodyguard and commands them to prepare tents and a feast for his honoured guests. He spares no expense, and the entertainments he provides for the Khea-khan’s courtiers are as breathtaking as they are inventive. During these festivities, you are approached by Bazan’s younger brother, Kumal. Politely, he asks if you have anything you wish to trade.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to trade with Kumal, <a href="sect192.htm">turn to 192</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to decline his offer, <a href="sect53.htm">turn to 53</a>.</p>
