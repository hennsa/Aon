<h3>45</h3>

<p>The caravan arrives at the ford shortly before dusk. You greet Captain Chan and inform him of the fight that took place here earlier. He is relieved to see that you and his scouts survived the deadly encounter intact.</p>
<p>Chan orders that the carriages of the caravan be positioned so that they form the points of a large triangle, with the horse teams parked at their centre. You approve of his order, for it will make a good defensive formation, one that will be easy to maintain if the encampment is attacked during the night.</p>
<p>You tie your horse to the rear of Princess Mitzu’s carriage, and then you walk over to the spring and bathe your face and drink your fill of its crystal-clear waters. You are about to return to the encampment when Captain Chan and Sergeant Yeng approach you on horseback. Chan tells you that his scouts have reported sighting movement in the nearby woodland. He wishes to investigate it, but night is closing in and soon it will be dark. Aware that you possess the ability to see in the dark, he requests that you lead Sergeant Yeng and his party on this scouting mission.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to agree to Captain Chan’s request, <a href="sect157.htm">turn to 157</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you refuse to lead the scouts, <a href="sect264.htm">turn to 264</a>.</p>
