      <h2>Map of the Khea-Khanate of Chai</h2>
      <p>The Khea-khanate of Chai is a land whose north-east is dominated by flat expanses of grassy plains, while the southern coast consists largely of forests and rolling hills. Two small mountain ranges, the Huzang and the Szuchow, are located slightly west of the country&rsquo;s centre and are separated by jungles which slowly give way to swamps as one moves further west.</p>
      <p>The city of Vabou is located near Chai&rsquo;s centre, and a traveller leaving Vabou would be able to choose between three of Chai&rsquo;s principal roadways in order to continue their journey. Choosing the south-west road would take the traveller towards the Chai Sea and the coastal town of H&rsquo;lau, with a jungle bordering the road to the north and the Huzang Mountains and its foothills to the south.</p>
      <p>If, instead, the traveller chose the south-east road, they would find themselves passing between the grasslands of the Chai Plain to their north and the Tviloi Forest to their south, with the road forking at the town of Klatii. One fork bears generally eastwards towards the river town of Hi&rsquo;joi, while the other turns further southwards through the Tviloi forest, passing through Jueng and ending at the town of Valus, which is separated from the great city of Dwala by the waters of the Tkukoma Estuary.</p>
      <p>Finally, the traveller leaving Vabou might choose the road bearing north, and after a journey flanked by the Nagah Forest to the east and Szuchow Mountains to the west, would arrive at Pensei, the capital of Chai and home of the Khea-khan himself. The capital is protected from the incursions of Chai&rsquo;s often unfriendly Bhanarian neighbours by the Chai Wall, a huge construction located a dozen miles to the west of Pensei, running about 50 miles from north to south, and anchored by several forts, notably Fort Jhung which stands athwart the road running west from Pensei into the nation of Bhanar.</p>
