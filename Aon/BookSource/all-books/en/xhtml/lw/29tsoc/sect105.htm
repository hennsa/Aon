      <h3>105</h3>
      <p>This shop is run by Pau Ping, an old apothecary who has lived in Dwala all his life. He greets you with a broad smile when you walk through his door. Pau Ping buys, sells, and prepares all manner of potions and healing medicaments. He invites you to browse his shelves. Most of his wares are ointments for soothing aching muscles and treating minor skin complaints, but there are a few potions among them that are of interest:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Oxydine: 40 Ren (4 Gold Crowns). Restores 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> when swallowed at any time. It also cures Korovax infections.</li>
       <li>Laumspur: 50 Ren (5 Gold Crowns). Restores 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> when swallowed after combat.</li>
       <li>Alether: 60 Ren (6 Gold Crowns). Adds 2 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of one combat.</li>
       <li>Malavan: 60 Ren (6 Gold Crowns). Increases the effect of Mindblast, Psi-surge, and Kai-surge by adding 2 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of one combat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may buy any of the potions listed above for the price indicated. They are all Backpack Items that will take up one space in your backpack.</p>
      <p>Pau Ping buys potions, but he will only pay you 20 Ren (2 Gold Crowns) for each one, no matter how much it may have cost you to acquire them. However, he will make an exception for some Karmo. He has a customer who will pay a high price for this potion. If you have a potion of Karmo and are prepared to sell it to Pau Ping, he will pay you 200 Ren (20 Gold Crowns) for it.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you buy or sell any potions while you are here, Pau Ping will gladly tell you where the Tower of Ishir is located (<a href="sect180.htm">turn to 180</a>). If you do not, Pau Ping shakes his head and politely asks you to leave as he is about to close his shop for the night.</p>
      <p>You bid him good night and return to the plaza to consider which street you should take.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to enter Drauzhi Street to your left, <a href="sect266.htm">turn to 266</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you choose to enter South Avenue directly ahead, <a href="sect292.htm">turn to 292</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you decide to enter N&rsquo;kow Lane to your right, <a href="sect221.htm">turn to 221</a>.</p>
