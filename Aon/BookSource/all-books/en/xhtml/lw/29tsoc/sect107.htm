      <h3>107</h3>
      <p>You hear shrieks of pain and triumphant Chai battle cries. Captain Jian Tzu has rallied the City Guard and he is leading them personally in a merciless pursuit of the Doomgah. The last of these loathsome creatures have been flushed out of the streets and passageways of Dwala and hounded mercilessly towards the quay. Now the few remaining Doomgah are being pushed off the quay into the turbulent waters of the estuary. None of them can swim and they all perish swiftly in the deep dark waters.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;For Chai!&rsquo; shout the victorious guardsmen, &lsquo;For Khea-khan and Chai!&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Journeymage Honos and Herbwarden Zautro are with Captain Jian Tzu and they spot you standing on the deck of the <cite>Silver Virixe</cite>. They hurry along the walkway of the stone pier and come running down the gangplank, their faces beaming with joy that you are still alive. They embrace you warmly and commend your skill and bravery. The dramatic turn in the weather tells them that you have overcome a great evil this night and saved the city, and all of Chai, from a terrible fate at the hands of the merciless Zashnor. You inform them about the Claw of Naar and they can hardly believe their ears. But when you point to it lying on the deck a few yards away, all doubt is swiftly dispelled. Journeymage Honos removes his cape and carefully he wraps the accursed artefact, making sure that he does not touch the twisted shaft with his bare hands.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;I will carry this back to City Guard headquarters,&rsquo; he says, solemnly. &lsquo;I fear that if you were to convey it along with the Eye of Agarash, the consequences would prove fatal, my Lord.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Your Sixth Sense tells you that Honos&rsquo;s fears are well founded. The close proximity of the Eye and the Claw would create a surge of evil energy that would kill you in an instant. You follow a safe distance behind Honos and Zautro as you return along the pier to the quayside. Captain Jian Tzu is overjoyed to see that you are alive. He salutes you and shakes you warmly by the hand.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;My eternal thanks, Grand Master,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Once again you have saved Chai from a great and terrible evil. You will forever be revered as a hero in our land!&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You are escorted by the Captain and his men along Xo Street to the Main Square where the headquarters of the City Guard is located. Awoken by the fighting and the ferocious lightning storm, many of the citizens are now gathered in groups in the square, chattering excitedly. They cheer and wave as you pass and the Captain and his men acknowledge their applause with proud smiles and salutes. When you reach the headquarters building you ask what has become of the Tower of Ishir.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;It has gone,&rsquo; replies Jian Tzu, sadly. &lsquo;It fell in flames an hour ago. I regret to inform you that there are no survivors.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>The Captain makes his personal quarters available to you. Before he leaves he tells you to get some rest and he confirms that Lord Rimoah will be arriving aboard <cite>Comet</cite> as planned, at noon.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;I will escort you to the North Gate shortly before midday and see you safely aboard,&rsquo; he says, and then he bids you good night and closes the door to his chambers. The physical and mental strain of your battle with Zashnor and its foul cohorts wells up and overwhelms you with fatigue. You climb onto the Captain&rsquo;s bed and fall immediately into a deep and dreamless sleep.</p>
      <p>You are awoken mid-morning by Journeymage Honos and Herbwarden Zautro. They bring you a hearty breakfast and together you eat and talk before Captain Jian Tzu enters to inform you that it is time to leave. You ride from the headquarters building to the North Gate in the company of the Captain, Lord Honos, and Herbwarden Zautro. The young journeymage carries the Claw of Naar still wrapped securely in his cape. Upon arriving at the gate, you see that it is open. Nearby, the smouldering remains of the Tower of Ishir remind you of the selfless sacrifices that were made during your long and difficult mission. You offer up a silent prayer to Goddess Ishir to cherish and preserve the souls of those who willingly gave their lives so that you might succeed. They have gone, but they will never be forgotten.</p>
      <p>While you slept, the dawn of the day brought with it a dramatic change in the weather. The skies have cleared and warm sunshine is drying the saturated streets of Dwala. Lord Rimoah arrives precisely at noon. <cite>Comet</cite> appears in a cloudless sky and gradually it descends until it comes to hover just a few feet above an area of cleared ground outside the North Gate. You hear its engine powering down to a soft hum and see Lord Rimoah and Blazer awaiting you at the rail of the stern deck. They both salute you with pride. The boarding ladder is lowered and you say farewell to Captain Jian Tzu and Herbwarden Zautro before you climb aboard. Journeymage Honos has been instructed to return to Dessi by Lord Rimoah. He has been charged with the safekeeping of the Claw of Naar until <cite>Comet</cite> arrives at the High Council in Elzian, the Dessian capital. Rimoah and Blazer greet and commend you on completing your mission successfully. Bo&rsquo;sun Durin takes Honos to his quarters in the bow while you retire to Lord Rimoah&rsquo;s comfortable cabin at the stern. On approaching the cabin door, you turn and take one last look at the city of Dwala and wave a final farewell to Jian Tzu and Zautro as <cite>Comet</cite> ascends smoothly into the clear blue sky.</p>
