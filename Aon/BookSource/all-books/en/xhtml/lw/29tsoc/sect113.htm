      <h3>113</h3>
      <p>The Khea-khan&rsquo;s bodyguard, Lieutenant Quang, enters the throne room accompanied by three men. Like you, they are dressed in normal Chai peasant attire. They address Lao Tin with the formal acknowledgement &lsquo;Your Highness&rsquo; and bow their heads in respect.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Please, gentlemen, introduce yourselves to our famous guest,&rsquo; says Lao Tin, motioning them towards you with a sweep of his hand.</p>
      <p>In turn, the men step forward and identify themselves. The first to speak is the eldest of the three. His name is Bai and he comes from the town of Klatii. The second man is Chao, from the village of Jueng. And the third is Deng, from the port of Valus. Like Anseng, they are all native Chai and have been Watchers for the Elder Magi for more than a decade. Bai is also an agent for Lao Tin and has provided him with reliable information about Bhanar that has earned him the Khea-khan&rsquo;s trust. You hear that he was in Dwala three days ago when the Elder Magi instructed him to go to Pensei ahead of your arrival here. He brought Chao and Deng with him. It is he who persuaded the Khea-khan to remove the Eye of Agarash from his throne and prepare it for your collection.</p>
      <p>Lao Tin informs Lieutenant Quang that he is to accompany you when you leave Pensei. He is to ensure you are not delayed on your ride to Dwala. You tell the Khea-khan that your plans have changed since you lost the tracking stone upon arriving in Chai. Now you need to return to the place where you landed so that Lord Rimoah can pick you up from there when he returns aboard <cite>Comet</cite>.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;So be it,&rsquo; replies Lao Tin. &lsquo;Lieutenant Quang, see to it that they have everything they need for the journey. You shall leave at first light.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You bid thanks and farewell to the Khea-khan and Captain Voushan, and then follow Lieutenant Quang out of the throne room to the concourse on the floor below. Quang informs you all that rooms have been put at your disposal where you can rest before you leave the Imperial Palace tomorrow morning. Before you retire, he invites you to accompany him to the Imperial Armoury where you will be free to choose any weapons and equipment you wish for the long ride ahead.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to accept Lieutenant Quang&rsquo;s offer to visit the Imperial Armoury, <a href="sect344.htm">turn to 344</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="sect135.htm">turn to 135</a>.</p>
