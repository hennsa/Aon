      <h3>148</h3>
      <p>It starts to rain as you approach the village of Zang at dusk. This picturesque Chai settlement sits astride the highway amidst a range of rolling hills. To the south-east you can see the darkening peaks of the Huzang Mountains, and to the north-west, beyond the hills, you espy the perimeter of the Northern Huzang Forest. Its giant toa trees are swaying gently in the strengthening breeze. You note that Zang has been spared the ravages of last night&rsquo;s storm; its shops and dwellings show no signs of damage. Its citizens have finished a hard day&rsquo;s work and are hurrying back to their homes, anxious to take shelter from the rain and settle down to their evening meals.</p>
      <p>Anseng leads you along the muddy main road towards a distant tavern. A brace of copper lanterns creak slowly in the breeze above its shiny red door.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here this night,&rsquo; says Anseng. &lsquo;The owner&rsquo;s an old friend and he owes me a favour or two.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>From the shelter of an awning, the owner&rsquo;s son watches your approach. When he recognises Anseng, he runs forward and takes hold of your horses&rsquo; bridles. He bows respectfully to Anseng and bids him welcome.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;And it&rsquo;s good to see you again, Jeng,&rsquo; replies your guide, as he dismounts. He retrieves his polearm from his saddle and then turns to you and says, &lsquo;Our horses are in good hands, my Lord. Jeng will take care of them. Come, let&rsquo;s get in out of the rain. I&rsquo;m so hungry, my stomach&rsquo;s beginning to think my throat&rsquo;s been cut!&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You enter the comfortable warmth of the tavern&rsquo;s taproom. Several of its patrons nod and smile when they recognise Anseng and they do their best to make you both feel most welcome. Tzu, the owner, is not much older than Anseng. He greets him warmly as if he were a long lost brother. He calls out to his doting wife, Yeng Zhi, to go to the kitchen and fetch some hot food for you both.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;My best rooms are at your disposal, my friends,&rsquo; says Tzu, enthusiastically. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an honour and a pleasure to have to stay with us this night.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>The hard day&rsquo;s ride has taken its toll. You are feeling tired and more than a little saddle sore. You may choose to stay in the taproom and eat with Anseng, or you can go to the room that is awaiting you upstairs and eat alone before you settle down for some much needed sleep.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you choose to stay in the taproom and eat with Anseng, <a href="sect291.htm">turn to 291</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you decide to go to your room and eat alone, <a href="sect97.htm">turn to 97</a>.</p>
