      <h3>169</h3>
      <p>Honos is receiving a message from the High Council. He presses the Speaking Stone to his chest and closes his eyes. Another minute passes in silence as you wait for him to conclude his mental contact with his distant elders. He is smiling when he opens his eyes.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;I am happy to report that my message has been relayed to Lord Rimoah and he&rsquo;s replied most promptly. He will fly directly to Dwala aboard the <cite>Comet</cite> and attempt a landing in front of the North Gate at noon tomorrow, so long as the weather is not too severe. He has also sent a warning to you, Grand Master, that the Eye of Agarash is now known to have revealed your location to the enemy from the moment you departed Pensei.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>&lsquo;If this is so, then they will know that you are here in the Tower of Ishir,&rsquo; says Zautro, anxiously.</p>
      <p>Song Tao uses her goodly powers to calm the Herbwarden&rsquo;s fraying nerves and she recommends that you all should now retire and get some sleep.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;I will pray to Ishir to grant us a break in the storm so that Lord Rimoah shall be able to land in safety tomorrow,&rsquo; she adds, and calls forward Jia Zhai to escort you to your room. You bid good night to the others and follow the Moon Maiden as she leads you out of the chamber and down the spiral staircase to the alcove behind the chapel&rsquo;s altar. She beckons you to follow her to another alcove and she opens a secret door to a comfortably appointed room with a bed and a narrow stained glass window. She wishes you a peaceful night&rsquo;s sleep before leaving.</p>
      <p>You remove your oilskin cloak, your boots, and your backpack and place them beside the bed. You are feeling weary and it does not take long for you to drift off into a deep sleep.</p>
      <p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If the number you have chosen is 0&ndash;2, <a href="sect37.htm">turn to 37</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If it is 3&ndash;6, <a href="sect81.htm">turn to 81</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If it is 7&ndash;9, <a href="sect117.htm">turn to 117</a>.</p>
