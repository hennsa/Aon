      <h3>181</h3>
      <p>Steadily, you catch up with Quang and the Watchers. As you rejoin them, you see something blocking the highway in the middle distance. A score of Skarada are shambling along the highway towards you. They took cover in the tall grass when you and your companions rode along this section of the highway two hours ago, and now they are trying to rejoin the survivors of last night&rsquo;s battle. You signal to the others to get off the highway and divert east across the open grassland, towards the western edge of the Tviloi Forest which is visible on the horizon. They acknowledge your command and together you gallop due east. As you race across the open plain, you are able to shake off most of the pursuing doomwolves before you reach the distant tree-line.</p>
      <p>Upon reaching the forest you find that the pines are widely spaced and you are able to maintain your fast pace with relative ease. However, this sparse border also makes it easy for a determined handful of doomwolves to maintain their pursuit. The rumble of distant thunder and flashes of sheet lightning herald the return of heavy rain. This sudden change in the weather works to your advantage, dampening the scent of your horses and making it harder for the few remaining doomwolves to track you. At length you come to a denser part of the forest that forces your mounts to slow their pace. It is criss-crossed with several narrow but deep gullies. You work your way around these fissures until you arrive at one that is much longer than the others. It stretches across your path and, at first glance, there appears to be no way to traverse it.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Over there!&rsquo; shouts Quang, pointing along the gully towards the east. He has spotted a dead pine that has fallen across this narrow ravine. Its trunk spans the yawning gap and provides a natural bridge to the far side.</p>
      <p>Quang takes the lead and you follow him in single file as he steers his horse safely across the fallen pine. When you reach the far side, you hear the ominous growl of a doomwolf close behind. The pack leader and three of its foul brood are in hot pursuit. They have already reached the middle of the tree bridge and will soon be upon you unless you can do something to halt their swift and determined advance.</p>
