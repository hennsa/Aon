      <h3>183</h3>
      <p>You awake just before dawn to the sound of a cockerel crowing in the garden of the inn. You get dressed and check your backpack and weapons before leaving the room. Anseng is already in the taproom. The innkeeper is with him and a breakfast of cold pork and vegetables awaits you on the counter.</p>
      <p>After the two of you have consumed the food, Lun-chow escorts you to the rear of the inn and ushers you into a small green-tiled stable. Two fine mares are saddled ready for you to collect. You mount up and Lun-chow bids you both a safe journey as you leave his stable.</p>
      <p>It is a grey dawn and a light drizzle is falling. Vabou is slowly awaking to a new day as you follow the main street to the town&rsquo;s north gate. The guards pay you no heed when you pass through the open gate and ride away from Vabou along the highway beyond. This is an ancient road which is paved with weather-worn flagstones. During your morning&rsquo;s ride, gradually the drizzle becomes rain but you are able to make good progress along the smooth paved highway.</p>
      <p>You reach the village of Uzam shortly after midday. Anseng signals to you to halt before you enter the settlement. He dismounts and inspects his horse&rsquo;s forelegs.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;As I thought,&rsquo; he says, disappointedly. &lsquo;The shoe on her left hoof is loose. If we continue on with it like this, she&rsquo;ll shed this shoe and go lame before the afternoon is out.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Only two nails are holding the shoe in place. You will need to find a blacksmith who can put this right before you leave the village.</p>
