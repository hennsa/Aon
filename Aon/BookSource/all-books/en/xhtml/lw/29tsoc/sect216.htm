      <h3>216</h3>
      <p>Lieutenant Quang enters the farm house. Once he has checked that the dwelling is empty, he beckons the Watchers to join him. You take up a position on the threshold of the creaking door and jam your foot against it to hold it open.</p>
      <p>The interior of the farm house shows signs of having been abandoned in a hurry. The embers of a log fire are still aglow in its stone fireplace, and the remnants of a hastily eaten meal remain on the table. The Watchers seat themselves around the table and rest their weary heads in their hands. Quang remains standing. Chao, Bai, and Deng are close to tears. They have been badly affected by the massacre of the refugees. You listen to Quang as he tries to console them but they are consumed with grief and do not respond. Then he reminds them that they must put duty first. Escorting you to your rendezvous place must be their first and foremost concern. By fulfilling this goal they will help bring about the swift avenging of the murdered refugees. The lieutenant&rsquo;s words inspire the Watchers and they draw strength from them. Soon they are able to compose themselves and refocus on doing their duty.</p>
      <p>Quang is able to gather enough food from the kitchen shelves to provide everyone with a meal. He brings you a bowl of cold boiled rice and diced raw vegetables before joining the others seated around the table. As they eat in silence, you eat your food with your fingers while you scour the surrounding countryside. Soon you detect movement along the ridge of distant hills. You magnify your vision and see a war party of Skarada moving rapidly along the hillcrest. They are heading in your direction.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re coming!&rsquo; you shout, and your warning galvanises your companions into action. As one, they rise from the table and quickly gather their weapons and equipment. In less than a minute you are all back in the saddle and heading south, eager to avoid being caught by the murderous Skarada.</p>
