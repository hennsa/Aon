      <p>You agree to Rakhi&rsquo;s proposal and pay her 20 Gold Crowns from your belt pouch. You may record this Wardstone on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item that you wear around your neck, suspended by its gold chain. If you enter into combat against an undead adversary whilst in possession of this item, you may reduce your enemy&rsquo;s <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 3 for the duration of the fight.</p>
      <p>Rakhi is delighted and she puts the Gold Crowns in her velvet satchel.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Thank you very much,&rsquo; she says. Then she leans across the table and kisses you fondly on the cheek. It is at this moment that Anseng arrives, having just completed his long conversation with the innkeeper.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;I see you&rsquo;ve found a new friend while I&rsquo;ve been gone,&rsquo; he says, with a grin, &lsquo;and I must admit, she&rsquo;s a lot prettier than me.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Rakhi giggles and bids you both goodnight. Clutching her velvet satchel, she leaves the table and Anseng sits himself opposite you. You ask him about his negotiations with the innkeeper and he nods his head wearily.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Lun-chow drives a hard bargain,&rsquo; he replies, &lsquo;but we have ourselves two new horses. I had to pay him every Ren I possessed to get them. Don&rsquo;t worry, my Lord. The Khea-khan is a generous man and he will recompense me once we reach Pensei.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Anseng tells you that two rooms for the night were part of the bargain he struck with Lun-chow. He hands you a key and tells you that your room is number 5.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;We have another long ride ahead of us tomorrow. Let&rsquo;s get some rest, for we must leave at dawn if we are to reach Pensei by nightfall.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Together you leave the booth and pass through the curtained archway. Both of your rooms are located on the ground floor, next to each other. Anseng wishes you a good night&rsquo;s sleep before retiring to his room, number 4.</p>
