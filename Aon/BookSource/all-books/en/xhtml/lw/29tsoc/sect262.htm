      <h3>262</h3>
      <p>With trepidation, you continue along the trail. You reach a section of the muddy forest path that is wider and straighter, and here you see that the tracks have changed. They indicate that several new barefooted creatures have joined with the ones you have been following, and the hoof-prints of the horse are deeper and more numerous. From these tracks you deduce that a struggle occurred here. The hoof-prints continue along the trail, but they are wider spaced than before. This tells you that Anseng was able to break free from the creatures and escape at speed along the path beyond.</p>
      <p>A gurgling growl makes you reach to your Kai Weapon and scan the surrounding trees. Several hulking grey shapes are closing in from both sides and your pulse quickens when you first catch sight of them. They resemble tall muscular humans, but these cadaverous creatures are neither human nor alive. Their scabrous hairless grey skins reek of a charnel smell that makes your stomach churn. Foul black fluid drips from their fanged mouths and a baleful green glow radiates from their ragged eye sockets. From the tip of index fingers of their right hands extend curved razor-sharp talons that glint in the subdued light of the forest. Your horse rears up in fright and you struggle to keep control of her as the creatures come leaping out from the trees with unnerving speed. These creatures are undead and you must fight them all as one enemy.</p>
