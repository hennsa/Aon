      <h3>297</h3>
      <p>An elegant Palace courtier takes you gently by the arm and escorts you to your sleeping room on the ground floor. Upon arriving, she opens the mahogany door, bows politely, and motions you to enter. You cross the threshold and stare in amazement at this luxurious bedchamber. The courtier bids you good night and the door closes behind her without a sound.</p>
      <p>Fine food and new clothing have thoughtfully been provided for you. You climb out of your damp and travel-stained clothes and ease yourself into the warm water of a sunken marble bath. The scented water soothes your aching limbs. After bathing, you eat before retiring to a majestic bed where you fall asleep as soon as your head touches the soft silk pillow.</p>
      <p>You are awoken before dawn by the harmonic tinkling of a small hand bell. You open your eyes and the first thing you see is the smiling face of the courtier. With a soft and lilting voice, she tells you that Lieutenant Quang will be in the concourse in thirty minutes time. You watch as she seemingly glides out of the bed chamber and closes the door. You arise feeling better than you have felt in days. A good night&rsquo;s rest and a generous helping of shameless luxuriance restore any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points you may have lost so far. You get dressed in your new clothes which comprise a crimson leather jacket, black breeches, sturdy black boots, and a dark green oilskin cape with a generous hood. After re-equipping yourself with your belt, Backpack, and Weapons, you leave the bedchamber and make your way to the concourse. The three Watchers are there and they bid you good morning. You have all arrived a little early and you have ten minutes to kill before Lieutenant Quang is expected. The palace courtiers bring you each a basket of freshly baked bread, cheese, and slices of veal with exotic fruits and together you eat a hurried breakfast beside the azure stream of the indoor garden before Quang arrives.</p>
      <p>The lieutenant appears, clad in his battle dress with his badge of rank prominently displayed on his dark green cloak. He ushers you all to the Imperial stables where you collect your mounts for the journey. They are fine steeds and will serve you well. You pass through the city&rsquo;s south gate just as dawn is breaking and begin the long ride to Vabou. The rain swept highway is still crowded with refugees but they quickly make way for you when they recognise Quang&rsquo;s Imperial Guard insignia and you reach the village of Uzam in the early afternoon. You pass by the blacksmithy and general store and notice that both places are now closed and boarded up. You are riding past the tavern when you see Kenga, the tavern owner, appear at an open upper floor window. He looks very frightened and he is about to shout something to you when he is dragged away from the window by unseen hands.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to stop and investigate what has just happened to Kenga, <a href="sect54.htm">turn to 54</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you decide to do nothing and continue your ride through the village without stopping, <a href="sect227.htm">turn to 227</a>.</p>
