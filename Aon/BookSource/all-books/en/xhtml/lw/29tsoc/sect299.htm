      <h3>299</h3>
      <p>Shousun hurries away to prepare your food and you try to relax after the rigours of your long ride. The greenish ale helps. It is called Chai-cheer and it is a brew famous throughout Magnamund. It is deliciously malty and wonderfully refreshing. Quang tells you that he chose his words carefully when speaking to the innkeeper. To have said nothing would have stoked his fears and caused unnecessary anxiety among the villagers. He is in no doubt that Shousun will not keep what he has been told to himself for very long.</p>
      <p>Soon the innkeeper returns with your meals, four plates stacked high with slices of grilled pork and copious roasted potatoes. He places the food on the table and hands you each a key to your rooms on the floor above. You eat your food in silence and then retire, thankful to be out of the rain and in warm comfortable beds on this bleak and stormy night.</p>
      <p>You fall asleep with ease but you do not rest easily. You are haunted by dreams filled with sinister shadowy images and premonitions of impending loss. Thrice you awaken during the night, drenched in cold sweat, and each time you do you find it hard to go back to sleep. When you wake a fourth time, an hour before dawn, you decide to leave your bed and sit by the window to await the coming light of day. Due to your poor night&rsquo;s sleep and the chilling nightmares you have suffered, you lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>.</p>
      <p>Quang, Bai, and Deng are waiting for you when you descend the stairs to the taproom below. Shousun&rsquo;s daughter, Zhou-yin, has brought your horses from the stable and they are tethered to a rail outside the front door of the inn. She has prepared some food to take with you. It is wrapped in four neat parcels of toa leaves and secured with twine. (If you wish to accept your food parcel, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Meal). You bid her thanks and tell her to convey your appreciation to her father when he awakens.</p>
      <p>Chao is in the market square when you arrive there, seated astride his horse. There is no need to ask him if he enjoyed his visit home; the smile on his face says it all. Quang tells you that it is a thirty mile ride from here to Valus and he wants to reach the town by late afternoon. The Watchers nod in agreement and together you set off along the highway heading east.</p>
