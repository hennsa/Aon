      <h3>308</h3>
      <p>You approach the open door of the farm house and enter. Having determined that this dwelling is empty, you beckon the others to join you and then you wedge the door open with a kitchen knife that is lying discarded on the floor. The interior of this dwelling shows signs of having been abandoned in a hurry. The embers of a log fire are still aglow in its stone fireplace, and the remnants of a hastily eaten meal remain on the table. You draw up a chair and seat yourself at the table, making sure you have a clear view through the open doorway to the hills beyond.</p>
      <p>The Watchers seat themselves around the table and rest their weary heads in their hands. Quang remains standing nearby. Bai, Chao and Deng are close to tears. They have been badly affected by the massacre of the refugees. Quang tries to console them but they are consumed with grief. He reminds them that they must put duty first. Escorting you to your rendezvous place must be their first and foremost concern. By fulfilling this goal they will help bring about the swift avenging of the murdered refugees. The lieutenant&rsquo;s words are inspiring and the Watchers draw strength from them. Soon they are able to compose themselves and refocus on doing their duty.</p>
      <p>Quang is able to gather enough food from the kitchen shelves to provide everyone with a meal. As you eat in silence, you detect movement along the ridge of the distant hills. You leave the table and go to the open doorway to get a better look. It is as you suspect; a war party of Skarada are moving along the crest and they are heading in your direction.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;They are coming!&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Your warning galvanises your companions into action. As one, they rise from the table and quickly gather their weapons and equipment. In less than a minute you are all back in the saddle and heading south, eager to avoid being caught by the murderous Skarada.</p>
