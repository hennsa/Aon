      <h3>349</h3>
      <p>You consider both suggestions and realise it is time you must face the harsh reality of your situation; you have no chance of reaching the rendezvous point in time. It is difficult having to admit this to yourself, and even more difficult having to inform your brave companions that you cannot go any further westwards. The risks of being captured or killed are simply too great.</p>
      <p>They accept your decision in silence, their faces taut with frustration and disappointment. Having endured so much hardship and danger since leaving Pensei, they are loath to give up now. Chao is the first to speak.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;My Lord, though it saddens me to have failed to carry out my duty to escort you to your destination, there may be another way to see you safely home. I propose we turn to the south-east and enter the Tviloi Forest. It will provide us with good cover from the enemy. My home village is Jueng and I know the forest well. We could ride to Jueng and stay there overnight. I can assure you all of a warm welcome there.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Quang turns his sullen head and stares at Chao.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;And what then? Do you have a plan that will deliver the Grand Master home safely, or do you simply long to return to your own home and to Naar with the vow you made to our Khea-khan?&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Chao begs the Lieutenant&rsquo;s forgiveness and asks to be allowed to continue.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Sir, with respect, I will never willingly break my vow. We will stay but one night in Jueng before continuing onward to Valus. The town has a ferry that crosses the Tkukoma Estuary twice daily. I propose we catch the ferry to Dwala. My comrade Watchers and I are based in Dwala. Our headquarters are in the Tower of Ishir. We are in regular contact with Lord Rimoah&rsquo;s envoy. Through him we could get word to the Elder Magi that the Grand Master is with us and they could direct Lord Rimoah to collect him there.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Quang considers Chao&rsquo;s proposal and his stern expression softens.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;My apologies, Chao. I should not have been so sharp with you. It is a good plan. I approve of it. What say you, Bai and Deng?&rsquo;</p>
      <p>The other Watchers are heartened by Chao&rsquo;s proposal. It offers them the chance to keep the solemn vow they made to Lao Tin. Deng is especially pleased for his home and family are in Valus and it raises his hopes of seeing them again.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;So be it,&rsquo; says Quang. &lsquo;We shall turn towards the Tviloi Forest and make our way to Dwala from there.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You are relieved that your mission may yet be completed and you agree to Chao&rsquo;s plan of action. But your sense of relief rapidly evaporates when you look towards the distant enemy. While you have been listening intently to Chao, you have failed to notice that several dark shapes are loping across the open plain towards you. Swiftly you magnify your vision and your heart skips a beat. At once you recognise the approaching creatures and you can hardly believe what you see: doomwolves!</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Hurry, hurry,&rsquo; you cry, &lsquo;we must go now, and quickly!&rsquo;</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to turn around and gallop back along the highway towards Vabou, <a href="sect3.htm">turn to 3</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to speed south-eastwards towards the Tviloi Forest, <a href="sect56.htm">turn to 56</a>.</p>
