      <h3>43</h3>
      <p>Halfway along Xo-lin Avenue is a small apothecary shop. Its front window is crowded with glass flasks, stoppered jars and conical shaped bottles filled with colourful potions, herbs and all manner of medicaments. Quang is fascinated by the window display and insists that you enter.</p>
      <p>Inside you are greeted by the apothecary and his brother, the co-owners of this shop. With welcoming smiles they invite you to browse their wares. Quang purchases a flask of Senara Tea and he makes Deng drink it. The soothing liquid will help him to recover from his state of shock. While he is administering the tea to Deng, you inspect the shelves and take note of the following potions with which you are familiar:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Potion of Laumspur: 40 Ren (4 Gold Crowns). Restores 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> when swallowed after combat.</li>
       <li>Potion of Alether: 50 Ren (5 Gold Crowns). Adds 2 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of one combat.</li>
       <li>Potion of Malavan: 60 Ren (6 Gold Crowns). Increases the effect of Mindblast, Psi-surge and Kai-surge, by adding 2 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of one combat.</li>
       <li>Tincture of Sabito Root: 100 Ren (10 Gold Crowns). Sabito Root is only to be found in the Boari Jungle of Valerion. It is rare in Chai. It enables the human body to extract oxygen from water through the skin, thus permitting anyone who swallows it to &lsquo;breathe&rsquo; underwater.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may buy any of the four potions shown above for the price indicated. They are all Backpack Items that will each take up one space. You are under no obligation to make a purchase.</p>
      <p>When Deng has finished the flask of Senara Tea, you bid thanks to the shop owners and leave. Soon you reach the end of Xo-lin Avenue and enter the quayside area. The churning waters of the estuary stretch out before you. Because of the heavy rain and failing light, you cannot see across the estuary to the opposite bank and have no way of judging how wide it is at this point. There is a ferry post close by and the ferry boat to Dwala is moored at the quay. You approach it, hoping that you are in time to catch the dusk crossing, but you find that access to this part of the quay has been chained off. A sign hanging from the chain says: <span class="signpost">Ferry cancelled due to weather</span>.</p>
      <p>Directly opposite the quay is a large three-storey building. The ornate sign fixed above its front door says: <span class="signpost">Ferry House Inn</span>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to enter the Ferry House Inn, <a href="sect114.htm">turn to 114</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you decide to look for someone on the quayside with a boat, and who is prepared to take you across the stormy estuary, <a href="sect202.htm">turn to 202</a>.</p>
