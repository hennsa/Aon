      <h3>64</h3>
      <p>The journey to Jueng village is completed without any delays or unforeseen complications. The muddy highway makes the going easy, despite the worsening weather. Heavy cloud and torrential rain accompany you throughout on your long ride. You reach the outskirts of Jueng shortly before nightfall. Chao can hardly contain his joy when he sees the lantern lights of his home village aglow in the distance. He has been away from his family for more than a month.</p>
      <p>Upon entering this pretty Chai settlement, Chao invites you all to come and stay at his house overnight. Lieutenant Quang thanks him for his generosity, but he is hesitant to accept his kind offer. He knows that Chao&rsquo;s house is small and his family is large. He does not want to cause any inconvenience to his wife and five children. He proposes you all vote for your preference: stay with Chao and his family, or seek accommodation for the night at the village inn. Chao, of course, wants to stay at his family home. Bai, too, is in favour of this. But Quang and Deng prefer to stay at the inn. This leaves you to cast the deciding vote.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to stay overnight at the village inn, <a href="sect317.htm">turn to 317</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you prefer to stay at Chao&rsquo;s home, <a href="sect184.htm">turn to 184</a>.</p>
