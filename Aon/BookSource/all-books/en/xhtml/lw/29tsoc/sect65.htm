      <h3>65</h3>
      <p>Chao has fallen from his saddle and he is lying face down in a large puddle. Quickly, you all dismount and hurry to drag him out of the water before he drowns. Deng rolls him over and slaps him twice but he does not respond.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not breathing,&rsquo; he says, anxiously.</p>
      <p>You place your hands on Chao&rsquo;s throat and forehead and draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Curing to transmit healing warmth into his body.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;My Lord, look!&rsquo; gasps Bai. He is pointing at the rain-drenched ground where Chao is lying. The surface water is turning red. You pull open Chao&rsquo;s rain cape and you are shocked to see that the left side of his tunic is soaked with blood. You rip open the tunic and find a puncture wound in the side of his chest. It was made by the thrust of a stiletto bone dagger when he ran the Skarada gauntlet. Desperately, you try to seal the wound but it is too late to save Chao. He is dead.</p>
      <p>The terrible realisation that Chao has passed away hits Bai and Deng like a sledgehammer. Their faces crumble and they begin to shiver and sob uncontrollably. Tears run freely down their cheeks as sorrow overwhelms them. Lieutenant Quang is also deeply affected by Chao&rsquo;s death. He has fought many battles and lost more than his fair share of friends and comrades, but Chao was a brave and decent man, a loving husband and a good father whom he had come to respect and admire. He did not deserve to die like this.</p>
      <p>You wrap Chao in his cape and raise the hood. Then you and Quang gently lift his body off the highway and lay it across the saddle of his horse. Quang secures him with rope while you try to console Bai and Deng. They are beside themselves with grief and cannot hear your comforting words. Nothing you can say will bring Chao back.</p>
      <p>Quang pulls Deng to his feet and leads him by the hand to his horse. Then he does the same with Bai. You and Quang help the Watchers to mount up and all the while not a word is spoken. You gather up the reins of Chao&rsquo;s horse and tie them to the back of your saddle and, in silence, you leave this miserable stretch of highway and push on towards Valus in the pouring rain.</p>
      <p>You reach Valus late in the afternoon. There is a constant rumble of thunder and thick black clouds hang heavy above the Tkukoma Estuary. Frequent flashes of forked lightning are making the waters seethe and churn. Quang leads you through the arched west gate and along a wide paved avenue to a crenelated building located at the heart of this large and busy town. It is a Chai army headquarters and barracks. He shows his rank insignia to the sentries on guard at the gate to the cavalry stables and you are permitted to enter. It is good to be out of the rain at last. You dismount and the stable hands come forward to take your horses. One of them approaches Chao&rsquo;s horse but Bai steps in his way and refuses to let him to touch his fallen comrade. He turns to Quang and begs him to be allowed to take Chao back to Jueng at first light. He feels it is his duty to be the one who delivers the sad news to Shen-Yin, and it is only right and proper that Chao should be buried in the village where he was born, raised and had lived for all his life. Quang takes Bai to one side and they talk for several minutes. When they return, Quang informs you and Deng that he has consented to Bai&rsquo;s request. He will remain here in the stables with Chao&rsquo;s body this night and ride back to Jueng tomorrow morning. Lieutenant Quang says that you must now leave and go in search of a way to reach Dwala, which is located on the east side of the Tkukoma Estuary. Before you go, you bid a sad farewell to Bai and say a silent prayer to God Kai to watch over Chao&rsquo;s soul and keep it safe from the evil of Naar, King of the Darkness.</p>
