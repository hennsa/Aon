      <h3>72</h3>
      <p>Deng looks down at the decapitated head of the Nagah Ghoul in shocked disbelief. He has heard of these evil undead but he has never before seen one with his own eyes. As he struggles to retain his breakfast and regain his composure, cautiously you enter an open doorway to your left. This is the tavern owner&rsquo;s living and sleeping quarters, a large room that extends the length of the building. On the floor near the open window overlooking the street is Kenga. The old man has had his throat slashed and he is lying dead in a pool of blood. On the middle finger of his right hand you see a gold signet ring and immediately your Sixth Sense detects that this is no ordinary ring.</p>
      <p>Kenga&rsquo;s Ring endows it wearer with a limited protection from evil. If you wish to take this ring and wear it, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. If you possess the maximum number of Special Items permissible (12) you must now discard one in its favour but you cannot discard the Eye of Agarash. Whenever the Eye causes you an energy drain, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If the number you choose is 0&ndash;5, the ring has no effect. If the number chosen is 6&ndash;9, you may reduce the effect of the energy drain by 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point.</p>
      <p>Deng has now recovered from shock and he is standing by a window at the far end of the room. He shouts for you to come and join him. Down in the rear garden of the tavern you see Quang, Bai, and Chao locked in a desperate fight with five Nagah Ghouls. They are faring badly and are in desperate need of help.</p>
