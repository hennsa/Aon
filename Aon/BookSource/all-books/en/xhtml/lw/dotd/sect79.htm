<h3>79</h3>

<p>You awake shortly after dawn to a chill morning and, unless you possess a Blanket, you must deduct 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. You are rising to your feet when suddenly you realize you are being watched. Two children, a boy and a girl, are sitting astride a little black pony, staring at you in disbelief.</p>
<p>‘Have you been asleep here all night?’ asks the young girl. You nod.</p>
<p>‘You should have called on our uncle,’ says the boy. ‘He’s the blacksmith of Oak Hill. He would have given you a bed for the night.’</p>
<p>The little girl leans forward and offers you some bread and cheese. Gratefully you accept her kind offer (restore 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point).</p>
<p>‘We’re on our way to Searsby for the feast of Fehmarn,’ says her brother. ‘Are you going that way?’</p>
<p>The village of Searsby lies to the south, where a road to the Kai Monastery branches off from the main highway.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the spell <i>Sense Evil</i> and wish to use it, <a href="sect30.htm">turn to 30</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accompany the children south, <a href="sect14.htm">turn to 14</a>.</p>
