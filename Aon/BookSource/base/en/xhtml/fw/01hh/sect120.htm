<h3>120</h3>

<p>Once the convoy is clear of the bridge, Cutter pulls over to the side of the highway and you stop in line behind him and the tanker. Uncle Jonas jumps down from his cab and together you run forward to check the damage to the bus. The front and sides are riddled with bullet holes, many of which have penetrated the engine and passenger compartments, yet, miraculously, no one has been killed or seriously injured. Aunt Betty-Ann appears at a window and reports that four members of the colony have been hit. She says not to worry—they have minor wounds and she is sure they will pull through.</p>
<p>The radiator is leaking coolant but Cutter is confident that he can have it fixed within an hour. ‘It’s a real shame we’ve got so few guns aboard,’ grumbles Cutter, as he sets to work sealing the perforated radiator mesh. ‘It ain’t no fun being the target for them punks when you don’t get a chance to shoot back.’</p>
<p>A hundred yards along the highway you see a sign that points to a road leading off to the east. It says:</p>
<div class="signpost">CARSWELL AIR FORCE BASE</div>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the base while Cutter finishes his repairs, <a href="sect342.htm">turn to 342</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to stay with the convoy, <a href="sect295.htm">turn to 295</a>.</p>
