<h3>163</h3>

<p>You step away from Meltdown’s body and turn to face the cheering crowd. Manhattan comes striding towards you, his face beaming, delighted that you have disposed of his would-be rival. ‘Nice work, kid. I knew y’was a Kicker when I first set eyes on you,’ he says glibly. Then he calls to one of his sidekicks and says something to him that you cannot hear. ‘Follow Tweet,’ he says, nodding to his grimy, one-eyed helper. ‘He’ll give you some chow and make sure you get some new equipment. Come see me in an hour—I’ve got a special job for you.’</p>
<p>Tweet takes you to a motel near the centre of town, where he offers you enough food for one Meal, enough water for two Drinks, and a choice of the following weapons, ammunition, and equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine Pistol</strong> plus <strong>twenty rounds of 9mm ammunition</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pistol</strong> plus <strong>six rounds of 9mm ammunition</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rifle</strong> plus <strong>six rounds of 7.62mm ammunition</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(You may take only one of the three weapons listed above. You also reclaim your <strong>Hunting Knife</strong>.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binoculars</strong></li>
<li><strong>File</strong></li>
<li><strong>Signal Flare</strong></li>
<li><strong>Compass</strong></li>
<li><strong>Geiger Counter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(You may take any number of the above Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>After you have eaten and re-equipped yourself, you ask to be allowed to visit the latrine. Tweet points to a restroom in the Motel’s lobby and tells you to be quick: Manhattan does not like to be kept waiting. Once inside, you discover what you were hoping to find: a window. The small window overlooks an old parking lot, and seconds later, you jump down into it.</p>
<p>You have been gone less than a few minutes when Tweet raises the alarm. Soon the town is swarming with clansmen searching for you. In desperation you hide in an old timber yard, where you wait patiently for the chance to slip out of Albany unseen. While you are lying low, you must take a drink or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
