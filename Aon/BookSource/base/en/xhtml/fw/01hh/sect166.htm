<h3>166</h3>

<p>You push away the lifeless body of your enemy and spring like a tiger towards the boarding door of the bus. Inside, chaos reigns. Behind the driver’s seat, Kate and Uncle Jonas are grappling with a fat clansman in a desperate attempt to prise a vicious machete from his hand. Meanwhile, the central aisle is blocked by a running battle as Hammer Harlan and Juan Rodriguez fight to defend the women and children from two fur-clad bikers. Their screams of terror merge with the curses of the clansmen, filling the bus with a chilling cacophony of noise. You act swiftly and decisively, plunging your hunting knife into the backs of the two bikers, and dispatching the third with a thrust to his heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound of a horn echoes from the other side of the camp, and you see the tanker, with Cutter at the wheel, start to move away. ‘Quick, Cal!’ shouts your uncle. ‘Get back to your roadster an’ follow Cutter. We’re breakin’ out o’ here right now!’</p>
<p>You leap from the bus and sprint towards your car as fast as your aching legs will allow. One of the bikers, dressed in a riding suit of tattered red leather, sees you running and stops his machine in order to draw his machine pistol. He is the leader of the clan and he intends to add you to the long list of those he has killed.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>, and add to this your current Stealth skill total.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0–5, <a href="sect301.htm">turn to 301</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 6–10, <a href="sect78.htm">turn to 78</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 11 or more, <a href="sect213.htm">turn to 213</a>.</p>
