<h3>185</h3>

<p>On your arrival at Colorado City you discover that the colony has been busy during your absence. Using materials salvaged from the ruins of nearby factories, they have managed to put down a platform that spans the gap in the middle of the bridge. Now Cutter is supervising the strengthening of this platform to ensure that it will withstand the weight of the loaded tanker, the heaviest of the convoy vehicles.</p>
<p>You tell everyone that you were unable to find an alternative way across the river, expecting the news to be met with disappointment. But most of the colony greets your scouting report with a nod of approval, a reaction that baffles you until Kate offers an explanation. ‘That explosive we found at Lake Sweetwater is now under the bridge,’ she says, pointing towards the newly-laid platform. ‘Once we’re all on the other side, I’ll trigger the timer and two minutes later … boom! No bridge! It might not stop the Lions chasing us but it should keep ’em off our backs until we reach Big Spring.’</p>
<p>You are about to take a closer look when Pop Ewell calls everyone to the bus. He has made radio contact with Big Spring. ‘Here, Cal,’ he says, handing you the headphones, ‘your ears are younger than mine. See if you can figure out what they’re saying.’</p>
<p>You slip on the headphones and listen to a voice that is almost completely obscured by the hiss and crackle of static. You close your eyes and concentrate as hard as you can in an effort to understand what is being said. ‘The guy says he’s going to pay us a visit,’ you say, hesitantly, suspecting that you have not heard the message correctly. Then the static fades and clearly you hear the words: ‘Be with you soon. Watch the skies!’</p>
