<h3>213</h3>

<p>With a tremendous effort, you leap and dive across the hood of your roadster to avoid being caught by the burst of automatic fire. Bullets follow you across the car, piercing the side and glancing noisily off the case-hardened rollbar, but your swift reflexes save you from being hit.</p>
<p>As soon as you are safely under cover you let out a scream that convinces your enemy that he has killed you. He turns his attention elsewhere, and you are able to pull yourself into the car and start the engine without being seen. Swiftly you accelerate away, steering your roadster towards the tail-lights of the bus as it crashes through a group of bikers and escapes onto the freeway. A few random shots ricochet off the trunk as you follow the bus out of Santo, but within minutes you pass out of range and the gunfire ceases.</p>
