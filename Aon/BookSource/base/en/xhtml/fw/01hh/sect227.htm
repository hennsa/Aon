<h3>227</h3>

<p>Cutter points to the side of the highway, where a length of crash barrier lies curled and twisted like a petrified metal snake. ‘We could rig that piece to the front of the bus,’ he says, indicating a v-shaped section shorter than the rest, ‘and use it like one o’ those ol’ fashioned batterin’ rams. It’ll protect the engine an’ wheels an’ pack one heck of a punch.’</p>
<p>Uncle Jonas looks sideways at Cutter, his eyes narrowed, his face drawn and serious. Then his expression softens and he starts to laugh. ‘Why, you sly old son of a gun. Trust you to figure out a way.’</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, the barrier is firmly roped and braced to the front of the bus. Cutter volunteers to take the wheel and lead the attack, with Uncle Jonas driving the tanker and you bringing up the rear in your roadster. If all goes to plan, the bus will smash through the barricade, leaving a gap wide enough for both the tanker and you to follow in its wake.</p>
<p>As soon as everyone is in position, Cutter gives the signal to move. Fortunately, the bridge is below you, at the bottom of a steep hill, enabling the bus to build up a good speed. Your heart quickens as the convoy gathers pace, and nervously you watch as your speedometer needle moves further around the dial.</p>
<p>The bus is fifty yards from the barricade when the defenders open fire, their automatic weapons filling the air with wave upon wave of lead. The vast bulk of the tanker shields you from this hail of death, but your heart goes out to those aboard the bus who must be bearing the brunt of this withering fire. Then you hear a tremendous crash as the bus slams into the barricade, and moments later you see the tanker shudder as it widens the gap that Cutter has made. It ploughs through with ease, but in doing so, it catches and spins the torn wreckage directly into your path. A cold chill runs down your spine as the twisted wreck of a car comes hurtling towards your windshield.</p>
