<h3>257</h3>

<p>‘You’ll never regret this,’ he says, excitedly, and scurries away to the rear of the cave to collect his meagre belongings. He reappears a few minutes later with a tattered rucksack on his back, and offers to lead the way down the steep hill. During the descent he tells you that Strawn is the next town due northwest. Before ‘The Day’, a large service depot that repaired buses and trucks was located there. If the part you need still exists, the service depot at Strawn is the place where you are most likely to find it.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the bus, you find that the reaction of the colony to Mountain Goat is less than enthusiastic. Most, especially the women, are horrified at the thought of having to share the bus with a smelly, flea-ridden hermit, and angrily they voice their protest.</p>
<p>Not until they have heard how he can help to get the bus moving again do they change their minds.</p>
<p>‘Where is this depot?’ asks Cutter.</p>
<p>‘It’s six miles northwest o’ here,’ pipes Mountain Goat, eager to appear helpful.</p>
<p>‘Good. At first light, Cal can drive us there and you can help locate the part we need.’</p>
<p>‘Mmmm … OK,’ replies Mountain Goat, hesitantly, ‘but first I think there’s something y’all should know.’</p>
