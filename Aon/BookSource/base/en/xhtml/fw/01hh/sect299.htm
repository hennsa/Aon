<h3>299</h3>

<p>You pull your T-shirt up to cover your nose and mouth before venturing out into the storm. Visibility is less than five yards and, with the dust constantly gusting into your eyes, you must rely heavily on your sense of hearing for some indication of the child’s location. Repeatedly you call out her name, hoping she will reply, yet all you hear is the incessant howling of the wind.</p>
<p>A wide avenue leads you to a baseball park on the edge of the school grounds. For a few seconds the wind drops and you are able to see a small grocery store on the other side of the avenue, its front door hanging off its hinges. You can make out a thin, faint sound coming from inside the store.</p>
<p>You run towards the entrance, eager to get inside before the wind picks up and you lose sight of the building altogether. The stench of rotting food assails your nostrils the moment you enter the store, making your stomach churn, but you force yourself to ignore it and continue your search. You call Maria’s name and hear the sound again: it is coming from behind the cellar door. In the eerie half-light you find the latch and lift it. ‘Don’t be afraid, Maria. It’s Cal,’ you say, hoping to reassure and comfort the girl, but when you push open the door it is not little Maria who greets you.</p>
<p>A seething flood of squealing rats swarms out of the doorway and breaks like a wave against your feet. You scream in shocked surprise and drag yourself onto a nearby counter as the ravenous rodents run amok. Most of the pack ignore you, but there are a few that have developed a taste for human flesh, and determinedly they claw their way up the counter in an effort to get at your legs.</p>
