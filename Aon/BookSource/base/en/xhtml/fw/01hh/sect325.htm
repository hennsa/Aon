<h3>325</h3>

<p>Reluctantly the sun dips below the horizon, relinquishing its reign to a full moon and a clear night sky. The landscape is shrouded in a ghostly twilight and, as the miles slip past, the temperature steadily drops.</p>
<p>It takes a little over twenty minutes to reach Mineral Wells. It seems no different to a handful of other towns through which you have passed today: it is derelict, decayed, and deserted. As you drive along the main street, you scan the rooftops in search of a radio mast, and, almost immediately, you discover what you seek. On the roof of a three-storey building at the end of the street is the tripod-like structure. The upper section of the mast has long since collapsed, but the remaining lower section is still intact, sufficient in length to carry a call-signal as far as Weatherford.</p>
<p>Stopping outside the building, you fasten your jacket against the chill night air; then you enter to find the dusty halls and offices of a commercial radio station awaiting you. In a studio at the top of the building you discover what you are looking for. Slumped over a control panel is the body of Doctor Drool, former ace DJ and anchor-man of Radio KLFM. Beneath his skeletal hand is the button that controls the station call-sign, a transmission that has played continuously for the last eight years.</p>

<p>You use your CB radio to call the convoy and tell them what you have found. Then you cut the power to the control panel, pausing briefly to sign-off for the last time on behalf of the Doctor.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the radio station, <a href="sect66.htm">turn to 66</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to return to the convoy without delay, <a href="sect284.htm">turn to 284</a>.</p>
