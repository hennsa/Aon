<h3>55</h3>

<p>It is nearly dusk when the clansmen and their chief reappear. Slowly the shiny Thunderbird drives towards you, positioned at the head of a torchlit procession of men and women dressed in strange, ceremonial robes. Chief Drawoher brings the line to a halt before the totem and calls for silence. Then he extols the virtues of Heng, the Thunder Spirit, and asks that he grant their request for rain. The clansmen form a wide circle around you and, as their leader steps forwards, they chant loudly and hypnotically.</p>
<p>With a glint of madness in his eyes, the chief unsheathes the sacrificial dagger, a blade carved from the bone of a buffalo, and holds it above his head. ‘You die so that the land may live!’ he screams, his voice barely audible above the drone of his followers. In desperation, you remove your free hand from behind your back and attempt to grab his wrist as he brings the dagger down towards your heart.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your current Field Craft and Stealth skill totals.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 13 or less, <a href="sect241.htm">turn to 241</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 14 or more, <a href="sect256.htm">turn to 256</a>.</p>
