<h3>62</h3>

<p>Over an ounce of lead shot hits the clansman in the chest, bringing him crashing to the ground. (Remember to deduct a round of 12-gauge ammunition from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) As he disappears from sight, his partner unleashes a long burst of automatic fire that powders the scree above and behind you. When the firing stops, you raise your head and peer through the bushes, expecting to see your enemy reloading. Instead he discards his empty magazine and turns to run away. He has exhausted his ammunition and has decided to make his escape before you have a chance to return fire.</p>
<p>As soon as you are sure that the coast is clear, you rise cautiously and then help Kate to her feet. The sound of a motorcycle riding away into the distance reassures you that your ambusher has fled, and confidently you scramble up the slope and go to examine the body of the one who did not get away.</p>
