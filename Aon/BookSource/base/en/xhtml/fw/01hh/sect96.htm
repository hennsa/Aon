<h3>96</h3>

<p>Your gunfire fails to bring down the clansman, but it passes close enough to make him veer away from the edge of the slope. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Cursing your luck, you shoulder your weapon and turn to Kate.</p>
<p>‘I’ve got to stop him before he reaches the roadster,’ you say. Kate protests, but you are determined to save your car, and reluctantly she agrees to cover you as best she can with a tiny Derringer pistol that she carries in her boot.</p>
<p>‘I call it “Chihuahua”,’ she quips, as she cocks the double-hammers and gets ready to fire. ‘It don’t look much but it makes one helluva noise!’</p>
<p>You scan the slope. When you have picked out the best place to make your climb, you break cover and zigzag along the shore towards it. Immediately, the machine gunner opens up on you. Kate replies with a single shot, and he diverts his fire back to the rocks and bushes. Swiftly you claw your way to the top of the slope and run straight at the clansman, grimly determined to intercept him before he can do any damage. He sees you approaching, draws a pistol, and empties it at your chest.</p>
<p>Add your Stealth skill total to your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is 9 or less, <a href="sect258.htm">turn to 258</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 10 or more, <a href="sect83.htm">turn to 83</a>.</p>
