<h3>Survival Skills</h3>

<p>Ever since the day you returned to the surface, you have endeavoured to develop your skills and natural instincts fully in order to best defend yourself and your colony.</p>
<p>Listed on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> are your five basic Survival Skills:</p>
<h4><a name="driving">Driving</a></h4>

<p>Your ability to control powered vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks.</p>
<h4><a name="shooting">Shooting</a></h4>

<p>Your familiarity and experience in the use of missile weapons, such as pistols, machine pistols, shotguns, and rifles.</p>
<h4><a name="fldcraft">Field craft</a></h4>

<p>Your knowledge and experience of all aspects of outdoor survival.</p>
<h4><a name="stealth">Stealth</a></h4>

<p>Your physical fitness, the speed of your reflexes, and your dexterity.</p>
<h4><a name="perceptn">Perception</a></h4>

<p>Your intelligence, your ability to evaluate information, your education, and your mental alertness.</p>
<p>Your ability in each of these five individual skills is measured in skill points. You begin with 3 points per skill. Before starting the adventure, you may allocate an additional 4 skill points to your list of five Survival Skills. These 4 extra points can be used to improve one or more of your five skills. During your adventure, all five skills will be severely tested; therefore the higher the individual skill level, the better your chances of survival. You may allocate your 4 additional points entirely how you like.</p>
<p>When you have decided where to allocate your 4 additional skill points, make a note of the totals in the Survival Skills section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. (In your first adventure, your total number of skill points should be 19: five skills x 3 points each = 15, plus 4 additional skill points = 19 points.)</p>
<p>If you complete successfully the mission set in Book 1 of the <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> series, you may add an additional 4 points to your Survival Skills in Book 2. These additional points, together with any equipment and provisions that you possess at the end of Book 1, may then be used in the next <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> adventure, which is called <a href="../../fw/02smr/title.htm"><cite>Slaughter Mountain Run</cite></a>.</p>
