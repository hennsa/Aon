<h3>106</h3>

<p>News of your escape into the southern ruins of San Angelo is relayed to Mad Dog Michigan. Already he has told the Angelinos that you have assassinated their leader and, in the prevailing emergency, he has appointed himself their new commander. He orders the Angelinos to saturate the southern sector and to kill both of you on sight.</p>
<p>You manage to reach the megamarket without further clan encounters, and are relieved to find that your roadster has remained undisturbed since you left it this morning. It takes a few frustrating minutes to start the engine, but as soon as it is running smoothly you leave San Angelo as fast as you can, heading south on the remains of Highway 277.</p>
<p>While you are driving, you must take a Drink or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
