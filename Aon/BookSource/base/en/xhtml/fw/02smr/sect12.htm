<h3>12</h3>

<p>For three long, hot, tedious hours you sit watching the two clansmen (during which time you must take a Drink or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points). You see them finish their meal and then attend to the repair of one of their motorcycle engines. You are beginning to fear that they have no intention of ever leaving the bridge, when another biker appears atop a ridge of high ground on the far side of the river. He approaches them and stops briefly to talk. Then the two clansmen mount their machines and follow him back across the bridge, accelerating away to the south.</p>
<p>Once you are sure that it is safe to continue, you start your engine and drive towards the bridge. As you approach the entrance you see the remains of the clansmen’s campfire, its ashes still smouldering.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stop and search the area around the campfire, <a href="sect111.htm">turn to 111</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to cross the bridge and press on towards San Angelo, <a href="sect213.htm">turn to 213</a>.</p>
