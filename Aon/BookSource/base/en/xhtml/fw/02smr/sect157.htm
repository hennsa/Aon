<h3>157</h3>

<p>Haskell dispatches three of the four clansmen, and the survivor manages to escape into the yucca forest. You are about to give chase when he says, ‘Let him go, Cal. He won’t get far on his own. Let’s see what they had on board the truck.’</p>
<p>You discover several crates and lockers filled with munitions: mortars, anti-tank weapons, heavy machine guns and the like. However, you cannot find any ammunition for these weapons. You are about to set fire to the truck, to prevent them from falling into the hands of other clansmen, when you discover one item that could be of some use after all.</p>
<p>In a sealed locker at the bottom of the heap, you discover a portable Leviathan ground-to-air missile, a weapon with approximately eight times the destructive power of a bazooka. If you wish to keep this Leviathan Missile, you must reduce your Stealth score by 2 points due to its size and weight.</p>
<p>Having set fire to the truck, you return to your roadster. You are just about to climb in when you feel an arm snake around your neck and pull you backwards into the yucca forest.</p>
