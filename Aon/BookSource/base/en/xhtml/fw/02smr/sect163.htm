<h3>163</h3>

<p>You plan to use the siren to lure the guards away from the stairs to a place where you can ambush them. To your left is an open doorway and quickly you slip inside to avoid being seen. You find that it leads to an empty locker room, and here you remove the siren from your pack and set its volume switch to maximum before pushing it outside into the corridor. Then you take your missile weapon and use its barrel to reach out and trigger the siren.</p>
<p>In the confines of the corridor the sound is deafening. Immediately the two guards come rushing forward to investigate, and, as they appear outside the locker room, you raise your gun and fire. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) The Detroit Lion opens his mouth but his dying scream is lost in the siren’s blare. The Angelino survives your gunfire and leaps through the doorway to kick your weapon from your hands. Instinctively you reach for a close combat weapon as the burly Angelino unsheathes his hunting knife and attacks.</p>
