<h3>181</h3>

<p>You step sideways into the corridor with your shotgun held at waist level. The guard to the left of the staircase sees you and tries to shout a warning but his words are lost in the boom of your gunfire. (Remember to deduct a round of 12-gauge ammunition from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) The force of the shot flings him against the wall, and as you swing the barrel towards his partner, you know only too well that you must make your second shot count just as effectively. But his partner’s reactions prove razor-sharp, and as you focus on him you are shocked to find yourself staring into the muzzle of his machine pistol.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth skill score and your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 15 or less, <a href="sect297.htm">turn to 297</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 16 or more, <a href="sect197.htm">turn to 197</a>.</p>
