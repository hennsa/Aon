<h3>201</h3>

<p>On the other side of the hatch you discover an electrical cable duct that is just large enough to accommodate both of you in some discomfort. You enter first, and then Kate squeezes in, closing the hatch behind her. It is now pitch black and very claustrophobic. Outside you can hear the angry screams and pounding feet of the clansmen as determinedly they try to track you down. The news of Mekong Mike’s death has been broken to the Angelinos and you have heard more than one of them vow that they will kill you when they find you. The only escape route open to you now is to descend the rusty rungs of the iron service ladder on which you stand.</p>
<p>Forty rungs later you reach the bottom of the shaft. You can feel the walls of a tunnel leading away to your right, but it is too dark for you to see where it leads or what it contains.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Box of Matches or a Solar Torch, <a href="sect109.htm">turn to 109</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess either of these items, <a href="sect238.htm">turn to 238</a>.</p>
