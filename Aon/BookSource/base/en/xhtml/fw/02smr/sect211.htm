<h3>211</h3>

<p>Expectantly you keep an eye on your rear-view mirror as you power your roadster along the rock-strewn asphalt of Highway 277. You are convinced that the Angelinos will soon be on your tail, yet you have covered fifteen miles and still there is nothing to indicate that you are being pursued. You are beginning to relax when Kate points to a small town in the distance. It is built around a bridge that crosses a stream of shallow black water that was once known as the South Concho River. Near the middle of this town, on the highway approach to the bridge, is a rising cloud of dust.</p>
