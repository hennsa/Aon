<h3>227</h3>

<p>‘What are you carryin’ in that bag o’ yours?’ says the short clansman, pointing his stubby finger at your Backpack.</p>
<p>Slowly you take off your pack and flip open the buckles. ‘What do you want?’ you say, inviting them to look at the items you are carrying. Roughly, the clansman pulls the pack from your hands and tips the contents onto the ground.</p>
<p>‘I’ll take these two,’ he says.</p>
<p>‘And I’ll have these,’ says his partner. ‘You can keep the rest o’ the junk.’</p>
<p>Erase from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> those items which you have noted in the first four sections of your Backpack Items list. These are the items chosen by the two clansmen in return for their help in getting you into the stadium. If you possess less than four Backpack Items, you must make up the difference by erasing Medi-kit units instead.</p>
<p>With broad smiles on their faces the two clansmen pocket your bribe. ‘You jus’ bought yourself a grandstand seat, fella,’ says the taller of the two as, once again, you climb the pile of rubble. This time you are accompanied by the two clansmen who help you over the wall and then return to the avenue, chuckling and congratulating each other on their good fortune.</p>
