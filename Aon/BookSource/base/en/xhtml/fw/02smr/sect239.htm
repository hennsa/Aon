<h3>239</h3>

<p>When you reach the street, Kate and the others are standing in a circle around Gunter, staring at his inert body. You reach for your Medi-kit, but Sergeant Haskell looks up and shakes his head, and you leave the pouch unbuttoned.</p>
<p>Without speaking, the sergeant and Knott take Gunter’s body away for burial and you and Kate busy yourselves by searching the station wagon. This vehicle belonged to the sniper, and inside you discover the following items, which he looted from the store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enough medicines and dressings for six Medi-kit units</li>
<li>Enough tinned food for eight Meals</li>
<li>Enough water for three Drinks</li>
</ul>
<p>You are able to siphon two gallons of fuel from the gas tank, enough to propel your roadster across the remaining thirty miles to Kent. As soon as the two marines return from their sad duty, you load up and take off along the freeway, heading west.</p>
