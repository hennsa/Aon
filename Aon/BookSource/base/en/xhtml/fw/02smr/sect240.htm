<h3>240</h3>

<p>You press yourself against the hot earth and pray that the clansman will stop before he reaches you, but when he is less than six feet away he catches a glimpse of your shoulders and automatically he reaches for his pistol. You sense something is wrong and you look up to see his sneering face. You are galvanized into action: with a superhuman effort you leap from the river bed and drag the clansman, screaming, to the ground before he is able to cock his pistol. A blow to the wrist disarms him, sending his gun skittering across the rocks, but he recovers quickly and rearms himself with a dagger drawn from his boot.</p>
