<h3>242</h3>

<p>The only way you can think of getting past the two guards is by luring them away from the stairs and launching a surprise attack, so you draw a close combat weapon and start to scream for help. Immediately the two guards come rushing forward to investigate your cries. As they appear outside the locker room, you leap out and strike the first man a heavy blow to the throat. The Detroit Lion opens his mouth to scream but nothing comes. Mortally wounded, he falls to his knees and is pushed aside by his Angelino partner as he tries desperately to fell you with the stock of his machine pistol. You dodge the blow and manage to force the weapon out of his hands. As it clatters to the floor, you leap forward and wrestle the guard to the ground.</p>
