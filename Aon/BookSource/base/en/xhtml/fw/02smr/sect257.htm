<h3>257</h3>

<p>You dive to the ground. Then you look up at the front of the drug store for some indication of where the shot was fired from. A second shot rings out and you pinpoint the sniper’s location just a moment before a stinging sensation assails your eyes. The bullet has hit the road surface a few inches in front of your face, and a handful of grit has been kicked up into your eyes: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Angered by this deliberate attempt to kill you, and by the heart-rending moans of the wounded Marine Gunter, you decide to flush this sniper out and even the score. Kate and the others are pinned down on the other side of the street and cannot move without exposing themselves to the sniper’s sights. Only you can reach the drug store entrance with some degree of cover.</p>
<p>When a third shot hits the helpless Gunter, your anger gives way to a grim determination. Despite Kate’s pleas to stay down, you spring to your feet and sprint towards the drug store entrance.</p>
