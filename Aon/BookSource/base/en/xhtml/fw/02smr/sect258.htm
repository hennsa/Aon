<h3>258</h3>

<p>You shoot less than a second before the Maverick discharges his pistol, yet your aim is deadly accurate. You deal him a fatal wound to the head that spins him sideways with the force of its impact. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Unfortunately, the pistol in his hand is not a standard factory model: it is a weapon he has customized to fire in fully-automatic mode. The selector is set to auto and, as he falls to the ground, he squeezes the trigger and empties the fourteen-round magazine in a line across your car.</p>
<p>A sharp, stinging core of pain erupts in your left arm as one of the 9mm bullets finds its mark: lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. With determination, you force yourself to ignore the agonizing pain and concentrate instead on escaping from the clutches of the other Maverick clansmen. Again, you attempt to start the car, but this time you take your foot off the gas as you turn the ignition switch, despite an almost overwhelming urge to stamp the pedal straight through the floor. The move works—the engine roars back to life—and within seconds you are accelerating away from the barricade, your eyes glued firmly to the convoy’s tail lights. A few poorly aimed bullets chase your escape but you soon catch up with the school bus and pass beyond range of the Mavericks’ guns.</p>
