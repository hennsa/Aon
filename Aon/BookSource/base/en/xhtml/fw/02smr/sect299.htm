<h3>299</h3>

<p>You wait until the stadium gate opens and the crowd of clansmen starts to enter before you make your move. Purposefully, you stride across the wide avenue that surrounds the stadium, trying not to look directly at any of the bikers or attract their attention. One of the trucks in particular has caught your eye and you head straight for it. It is towing a trailer that contains two powerful-looking motorcycles, and you are convinced that they are to be used in the races. If any of the trucks are to enter the stadium then this one surely will.</p>
<p>There is nobody in the truck and its rear door is unlocked, so quickly you climb aboard and find yourself a hiding place behind two large drums of gasolene. After a few minutes, you hear somebody climb into the cab and start the engine. Then the truck moves away and you sense by its direction that it is approaching the stadium gate. You see the shadow of the arch fall across the trailer and then suddenly the vehicle halts. Your heart pounds in your chest as you hear the rear doors creak open and sense someone clambering aboard.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth skill score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 6 or less, <a href="sect115.htm">turn to 115</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 7 or more, <a href="sect68.htm">turn to 68</a>.</p>
