<h3>312</h3>

<p>You can see the first rays of dawn light in your rear-view mirror as you pull out from behind the bus and start to overtake the convoy. As you draw level with the tanker, a watery spray speckles your windshield and you catch the strong, unmistakable smell of gasolene in the air. A stream of the precious liquid is escaping from a bullet hole in the tanker’s side, and, as you draw level with the cab, you signal anxiously to Uncle Jonas to stop at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>You have covered less than a mile when the freeway approaches the ruins of Stanton, a town long since looted and forgotten by the Mavericks, and you bring the convoy to a halt. Pecos Pete offers to help Uncle Jonas patch up the damage, and while you are waiting for them to finish their work, you ask Cutter to help you tell the rest of the colony your plan to rescue Kate. At first there are many who think you are being crazy and irresponsible. But gradually, after listening to Cutter’s pleas on your behalf, they relent and finally consent to your rescue attempt.</p>
<p>Your plan is to go it alone to San Angelo. When you arrive there you will infiltrate the town while Mad Dog Michigan and his gang are busy wheeling and dealing with the Angelinos. Once you have found and rescued Kate, you will leave the city and make your way west to rendezvous with the convoy at a town called Kent, situated at the fork where Interstate 20 joins Interstate 10. The rendezvous is planned to take place exactly seven days from now. If either you or the colony fails to get there by midday, the party that does arrive is to assume the worst and press on to El Paso without delay.</p>
<p>Before you leave, two large plastic containers, filled with sufficient fuel to enable you to complete the 400-mile detour you have in mind, are loaded into the trunk of your roadster. Then, with the tanker repaired and your preparations complete, the colonists, especially your aunt and uncle, bid you an emotional farewell. They are fearful of what might befall you, but all, without exception, admire your bravery and determination to save the girl you love.</p>
<p>Silently you watch the convoy rumble out of Stanton until it has passed beyond the western horizon. The sun has now risen, and the pot-holed remains of State Highway 137 can be seen cutting a straight line to the south. A wave of uncertainty unsettles your stomach as you think about the difficult mission you have set yourself, but you are quick to dismiss these fears.</p>
<p>‘I’ve got a job to do and I’m gonna see it gets done!’ you shout, as you start your engine and point your car southwards.</p>
