<h3>315</h3>

<p>You are nearly at the top of the wall when you lose your footing and fall backwards. In a cloud of dust and loose debris, you tumble head-over-heels down the heap and come to an abrupt and painful halt in the avenue below: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>‘What were you up to?’ growls the shorter of two ugly-looking Detroit Lions who have appeared suddenly and are now standing over you.</p>
<p>‘Why ain’t you using the North Gate, eh? That’s where the Angelinos are supposed to be meetin’.’</p>
<p>Stiffly you clamber to your feet and begin to brush away the thick layer of dust that covers you completely, until you realize that it is the dust that is concealing the fact that you are not an Angelino.</p>
<p>‘I’m an Angelino who jus’ wants t’see the race. I’m supposed to be patrolling the south zone, but ain’t nothin’ ever happens down there. Gimme a break, you guys, will ya?’</p>
<p>A grin spreads slowly across the faces of the two Lions as they see a chance to make some easy pickings. They agree to get you into the stadium, but at a price; you will have to bribe them.</p>
