<h3>347</h3>

<p>It is almost noon when you drive into Brogado. The storm-shattered ruins of this mountain town do not inspire much hope of finding fuel, and, after making a thorough search of its two gas stations, your initial fears are confirmed: one station has been looted and the other has been gutted by fire.</p>
<p>It is beginning to look as though you will have to walk the last thirty miles to Kent when Marine Gunter sees a station wagon backed up to the entrance of a drug store, and he calls it to your attention. All five of you are walking along the main street towards the vehicle when a shot rings out from the first floor window of the store, and Gunter is brought to the ground, clutching his bloodstained chest.</p>
<p>‘Sniper!’ shouts Sergeant Haskell. ‘Hit the deck!’</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth and Perception skill scores.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 10 or less, <a href="sect257.htm">turn to 257</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 11 or more, <a href="sect92.htm">turn to 92</a>.</p>
