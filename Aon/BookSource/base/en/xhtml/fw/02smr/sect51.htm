<h3>51</h3>

<p>As you steer away from the pump house, you look in your mirror to see the biker speeding towards the apex of the roof. He is within a few inches of the top when it suddenly caves in beneath his front wheel and he is flung head-first over the handlebars. With a scream of terror he cartwheels through the air and lands heavily on his back at the edge of the freeway. Winded by the fall, he cannot summon enough strength to roll away as his bike comes crashing down upon him.</p>
<p>Certain in the knowledge that he could not possibly have survived such a terrible crash, you return to the highway and begin the next stage of your journey to San Angelo. You join the highway, heading south, and within a few minutes you catch sight of a town on the road ahead. A glance at your <a href="map.htm">map</a> confirms your suspicions: you are approaching Sterling City.</p>
