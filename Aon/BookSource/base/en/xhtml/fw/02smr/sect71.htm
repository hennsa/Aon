<h3>71</h3>

<p>The clansman’s bullets whistle within inches of your head, and tear chunks of mineral from the stalagmites behind which you have dived. Razor-sharp splinters pepper your face and you skin your hands and knees as you land heavily on the jagged, unyielding stone floor: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Moments later the gunfire ceases and you hear the clansman utter an agonized scream. You lift your head in time to see him staggering slowly towards you, his eyes wide with pain as he works his hands frantically behind his back as if he were trying to clutch at something. Then his body stiffens, and, as he falls to the floor, you see what it was that he was trying so desperately to clasp. It is the spear-like tip of a broken stalactite, hurled from the ledge above the defile by a mortally wounded caveman in a last desperate act of defiance.</p>
<p>Kate moves forward to check that the clansman is dead and to search his body. She keeps what she needs: his machine pistol, a quantity of ammunition, and his water canteen, and offers the rest of his possessions to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enough food for one Meal</li>
<li>Enough sulfonamides for one Medi-kit unit</li>
<li>Flick Knife (2)</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Binoculars</li>
</ul>
<p>If you keep any of these items, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>As soon as you are ready, you retrace your way along the defile and return to the surface.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="sect168.htm">Turn to 168</a>.</p>
