<h3>77</h3>

<p>At your killing blow, your adversary drops in a limp and lifeless heap at your feet. Meanwhile, his confederate has run back to his motorcycle and armed himself with a machine pistol. You dive aside just in time to avoid his first burst of fire, and, as you scurry for cover, you retrieve the pistol that you had kicked from his dead partner’s hand.</p>
<p>With a vengeful scream, the clansman comes running at you, firing his machine pistol from the hip. Bullets tear up the ground where you lie, forcing you to stand up and meet this madman head on. Quickly you cock the pistol and take aim at his chest as he comes bounding across the rock-strewn highway, his teeth bared and his eyes blazing with hatred.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your current Shooting skill score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 6 or less, <a href="sect151.htm">turn to 151</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 7 or more, <a href="sect138.htm">turn to 138</a>.</p>
