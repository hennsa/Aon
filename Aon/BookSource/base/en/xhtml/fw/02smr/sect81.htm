<h3>81</h3>

<p>The wheels and tyres squeal as you stand on the brake pedal in a desperate but futile attempt to halt the skidding roadster. Then, with a shuddering jolt, the car slams sideways into the service bay door and comes to an abrupt halt. The reinforced passenger door withstands much of the impact, but the crash leaves you concussed and badly bruised (lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>Wincing from the pain of your injuries, you try to keep as still as possible as the pack of clansmen, fifty riders strong, roars past the lot. Soon they have gone and, despite your pain, your spirits are raised by the thought that there will now be at least fifty fewer of Mad Dog’s men to face when you reach San Angelo.</p>
<p>After satisfying yourself that the damage to your roadster is superficial, you cast your eyes around the derelict car lot.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to search the lot, <a href="sect124.htm">turn to 124</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to leave and continue your journey to San Angelo, <a href="sect342.htm">turn to 342</a>.</p>
