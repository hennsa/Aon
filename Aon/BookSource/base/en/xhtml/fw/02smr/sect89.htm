<h3>89</h3>

<p>To avoid being seen by the two guards, you slip inside a doorway to your left and discover that it leads to an empty locker room. Having already removed the signal flare from your pack, you glance quickly into the corridor in order to establish where the guards are standing. Then you hold the flare out at arm’s length, point it in their direction, and pull its ignition cord. (Remember to erase this item from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>In the confines of the corridor the flare erupts with devastating effect, its crimson smoke and hissing flame blinding and choking the two clan bodyguards. You grab a towel, which is hanging behind the door, and use it to cover your mouth as you run down the smoke-filled corridor. When you reach the stairs, the clansmen are incapable of defending themselves and you silence them swiftly with a close combat weapon. You are halfway up the stairs when you see the door to the observation block start to open.</p>
