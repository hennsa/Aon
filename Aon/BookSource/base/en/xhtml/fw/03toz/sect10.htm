<h3>10</h3>

<p>The moment you break cover, you hear another shot and feel something hot and sharp graze the top of your head: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. The awful suddenness and accuracy of the sniper’s shot makes you think twice. You abandon your attempt to spot him and seek once more the safety of the truck’s steel skin.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of your eye you see the captain cock his machine pistol and get ready to open fire. ‘OK, I’m gonna see if I can flush this Yankee out,’ he says vehemently, clearly unimpressed by how near you came to death. ‘When I start firin’, you see if you can pinpoint where he is.’</p>
<p>You nod in uneasy agreement and get ready to glance around the tailgate the instant the captain opens fire. ‘Let’s do it!’ he says, as he rises above the cover of the truck and squeezes off a burst of automatic fire. The noise of his gun drowns out the sniper’s shot, but within a second of his breaking cover, Frankland is hit. With the machine pistol still chattering in his hands, he falls backwards and crashes to the ground, the assassin’s bullet lodged deep in his skull.</p>
<p>The shock of Frankland’s death, following so closely after Sergeant Haskell’s and so nearly after your own, hits you like an icy shower. You cower behind the truck, shivering with fear and convinced that you will be next. For a terrible moment, the fear wells up and consumes you, and all you want to do is run as far away and as fast as you can. Despite Knott’s pleas to stay where you are, you scramble to your feet and stumble blindly towards the woods. In your haste you trip and fall, grazing your hands and knees on the flint-sharp shale: lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point.</p>
<p>Inadvertently, your fall saves your life. Another shot passes over your head barely a second after you stumble, missing you by a hand’s breadth. The imminent danger clears your mind and you race towards the trees with a determination to survive. Knott encourages you to increase your speed and you pray that you will reach cover before the sniper has a chance to slip another round into the breech of his rifle.</p>
<p>Add together your Stealth skill total and your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score. (Note: If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score is low and you are heavily encumbered, it may be advisable to discard some of your Backpack Items in order to increase your Stealth skill level.)</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 15 or less, <a href="sect57.htm">turn to 57</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 16–19, <a href="sect83.htm">turn to 83</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 20 or more, <a href="sect254.htm">turn to 254</a>.</p>
