<h3>104</h3>

<p>Instinctively you reach for your gun as you spin around to face your potential attacker, but your fear fades quickly when you see the familiar face of Marine Knott peering at you from over the walkway wall.</p>
<p>‘You’re getting a touch careless, Cal,’ he says, as he holsters his pistol and clambers over the wall to join you.</p>
<p>‘Yeah, you’re right,’ you reply, self-consciously. ‘I oughta know by now. Better late than dead, right?’</p>
<p>‘Right,’ he says, and slaps you reassuringly on the back. ‘The bridge is over there. It’ll only take a few minutes to reach it. If all’s well, the captain and Sergeant Haskell should already be there waitin’ for us.’</p>
<p>You set off, soon reaching a cluster of old US immigration offices standing at the approach to the bridge. As Knott predicted, Frankland and Haskell are waiting for you to show and, as you approach the buildings, they call you over to join them. They have already scouted the bridge and determined that there are four clan guards on the bridge itself, but none at all on the service walkway that runs beneath it.</p>
<p>‘We’ve less than an hour before the explosives are due to arrive,’ says the captain, checking his watch. ‘Is everyone ready?’</p>
<p>You nod in unison. ‘OK then. Let’s go!’</p>
