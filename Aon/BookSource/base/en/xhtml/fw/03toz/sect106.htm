<h3>106</h3>

<p>‘I think I might have the answer to our problem,’ you say, as you fish in your Backpack for the solar regulator. The unit is not designed to fit this vehicle, but you plan to attach it to the battery’s terminals and then short circuit the unit to provide a surge of power, sufficient to recharge the battery and spark the engine.</p>
<p>It takes nearly an hour to rewire the regulator, by which time the sun is beating down directly onto the exposed, unregulated solar core. The cells at the core convert the solar power unchecked, and within a few minutes the unit is humming and giving off wisps of pungent blue smoke.</p>
<p>‘Try starting it now,’ you call out to Knott, who is sitting in the driver’s seat, looking as anxious as if he were sitting on a ticking time bomb. He hot-wires the ignition switch and immediately the engine coughs and splutters into life. As soon as it is running smoothly, you cover your hands with your leather jacket, disconnect the red-hot regulator from the battery, and throw it away.</p>
<p>This item is now beyond repair: remember to erase it from your list of Backpack Items before you continue.</p>
