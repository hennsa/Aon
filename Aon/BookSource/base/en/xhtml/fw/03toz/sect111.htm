<h3>111</h3>

<p>You give your enemy your undivided attention, for he is a formidable opponent. Also, he presents a difficult target: he is partially hidden behind the brick pillar of a hardware store, and his black suit merges readily with the shadows. Despite these disadvantages, you know that this may be your only chance to put an end to his pursuit and avenge the lives of your three dead comrades.</p>
<p>You watch as he completes the reloading of his rifle. Then he shoulders the weapon and takes up a pair of binocular-like field glasses, which hang from a strap around his neck. He places these bulky lenses to his visor and methodically scans the surrounding rooftops. This seems a curious thing to do as the buildings are very close: surely he does not need binoculars to be able to see if anyone is standing on top of them?</p>
<p>You prepare your own weapon and get ready to take aim. Then a chill stabs your heart as he scans the first floor windows of the courthouse and you realize that he is not using a regular pair of binoculars: they are sophisticated, high-resolution, image intensifiers.</p>
<p>Immediately you duck back from the window, but you cannot help but fear that he has already located your position.</p>
