<h3>123</h3>

<p>You are within ten feet of the top when the rock you are grasping tears loose in your hands. Frantically you throw out your arms in an attempt to find a new hand-hold, but you are already falling backwards and your flailing hands claw only air. For a few seconds your senses are scrambled as you tumble down the rock-face, and then you hit the edge of the gully and your vision becomes cloudy: lose 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>When eventually it clears you find yourself lying at the bottom of the gully, staring at the sky. Wearily you drag yourself to your feet, rub your aching limbs, and then stagger towards your motorcycle. You are expecting to find little more than a twisted heap of scrap metal, so it comes as a pleasant surprise to discover that the machine is still in working order. After straightening the handlebars, the headlight, and the front wheel alignment, you are able to restart the engine with your fourth kick.</p>
<p>You ride this wide trench until you find a suitable place, on the far side of the rockfalls to make your exit. The ascent is accomplished without difficulty, but as you clear the crest of the gully and bring your motorcycle to a stop, you notice something that makes you break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>From the eastern end of the gully a cloud of dust is approaching. It is over a mile distant, but you can tell at once that it is being kicked up by a motorcycle. You stare at the approaching machine and, although you cannot see the rider, you know that it is the assassin. Chilled by his proximity, you wind back the throttle and gun your bike along the bumpy mountain road.</p>
