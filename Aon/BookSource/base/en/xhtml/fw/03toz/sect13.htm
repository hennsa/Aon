<h3>13</h3>

<p>You dive to the ground and let out a yelp of pain as you gash the palms of your hands and knees on the jagged rubble (lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points). Marine Knott lands beside you as the beam of torchlight passes over your body. For a few seconds it hovers nearby; then it returns to bathe you both in its revealing glare.</p>
<p>An angry shout is followed by two gunshots and the sound of dogs barking. The bullets slam into the ground near your head. ‘Run for it!’ you hiss. ‘We’ve been seen.’</p>
<p>Ignoring the stinging pain of your wounds, you rise to your feet and sprint towards the darkness. Knott disappears to your left just seconds before you reach the freeway arch. You continue to run and are about to emerge from beneath the elevated freeway when the sound of growling stops you dead in your tracks. Ahead two squat shadows move purposefully towards you. You raise your gun but hesitate to pull the trigger for fear of attracting more of the enemy. Your moment’s hesitation is seen as a sign of weakness, and instantly the two dogs bound forwards and hurl themselves at your chest.</p>

<p>Owing to the speed and the ferocity of their attack, you cannot make use of a close combat weapon until the beginning of the second round of combat.</p>
