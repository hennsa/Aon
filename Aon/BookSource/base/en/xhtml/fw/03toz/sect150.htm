<h3>150</h3>

<p>For a few seconds you stand entranced, not knowing for sure whether you are dead or alive. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Then, as the warm breeze clears the lingering gun smoke, you see the body of the assassin lying motionless beside the courthouse wall. You are filled with a great sense of relief, as if a huge weight has been lifted from your shoulders. Then the shock of your encounter takes hold of your body and you begin to shiver uncontrollably. You must now take a Drink or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>With grim curiosity you move forward to search the body. You pull off his helmet and stare at the face of this killer. At once you recognize the cruel, angular features: he is Helmut Varken, a top HAVOC assassin who achieved infamy on 1 May, 2008 when he assassinated both the President of the United States, and the General Secretary of the Supreme Soviet at an emergency summit meeting in Rome. HAVOC was proud of his ignoble feat, and when by chance they leaked his identity, his photograph appeared on every television screen and on the front page of every newspaper around the world. You were only seven years old at the time, but the image of his face became synonymous with the evil that HAVOC represented, and it etched itself indelibly upon your mind.</p>
<p>As your pulse returns to normal, you begin to search his bloodstained body. You are disappointed to find that his air-con suit has been irreparably damaged, but you discover more than enough useful items to compensate for the loss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rifle (containing twenty-two rounds of 7.62mm ammunition)</li>
<li>Pistol (containing ten rounds of 9mm ammunition)</li>
<li>Twenty rounds of spare 7.62mm ammunition</li>
<li>Fifteen rounds of spare 9mm ammunition</li>
<li>Combat Viewer</li>
<li>HE Grenade</li>
<li>Tear Gas Grenade</li>
<li>CB Radio</li>
<li>Knife (2)</li>
<li>Enough food for three Meals</li>
<li>Enough medical supplies for eight Medi-kit units</li>
<li>Enough water for three Drinks</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Map</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to keep any of these items, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>After finishing your search, you leave the courthouse and commandeer Varken’s motorcycle. You are anxious to reach Tucson as quickly as you can, so you kick start the machine and speed away from Tombstone, heading north on Highway 80.</p>
