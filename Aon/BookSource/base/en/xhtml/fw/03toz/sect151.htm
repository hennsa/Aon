<h3>151</h3>

<p>Swiftly you descend the fire escape into the alley below, seconds before a group of clansmen turn the corner and come running towards you. Fortunately, they are without torches and in their haste they fail to notice the four of you hiding in the shadows as they make their way around to the rear of the building.</p>
<p>The moment they have gone, the captain leads you along a covered walkway that ends at a rotunda. Opposite this paved concourse is the entrance to a bus depot, and parked close by is a US army jeep containing two clansmen. Judging by the long-horned skull emblazoned on the vehicle’s side, they are members of the Texan clan known as the Mavericks.</p>
<p>‘There’s our ticket outta here,’ says Captain Frankland. Silently he draws his knife and holds it to his cheek as he asks for a volunteer to help him commandeer the jeep.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to volunteer to ambush the two Mavericks, <a href="sect2.htm">turn to 2</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to volunteer, <a href="sect292.htm">turn to 292</a>.</p>
