<h3>199</h3>

<p>You hit the ground and roll under a car in time to see the clansmen’s feet reach the base of the ramp. For a few seconds the men remain stationary; then they advance along the centre aisle, stopping occasionally to check between the rows of parked cars. You keep as still as possible until they reach the stairs and begin to ascend, and then you crawl out from your hiding place and make a run for the exit ramp.</p>
<p>By the time the clansmen realize that you have given them the slip, you are a safe distance from the parking lot and heading into the heart of the city. By keeping strictly to alleys and side streets you are able to avoid clan patrols and reach the banks of the Rio Grande without incident. Then you head west, following the river towards your rendezvous destination.</p>
<p>Your early encounters with Mad Dog’s men have delayed you and now, as you hurry along the walkways and plazas bordering the river, you are fearful that you will arrive too late to join the others. In your haste you become less cautious, taking risks that might prove dangerous.</p>
<p>You are hurrying along a walled sidewalk when you catch sight of the Stanton Street Toll Bridge less than 400 yards away. You are confident that it is the right bridge because it is the only one still intact. A glance at your wristwatch shows that you have less than ten minutes to spare. You are about to break into a run when suddenly you hear a noise behind you that makes you freeze: it is the sound of a pistol being cocked.</p>
