<h3>213</h3>

<p>You fire, and almost immediately throw yourself to the floor of the truck, hoping to avoid your enemy’s return fire. Fortunately, your move proves unnecessarily cautious: your burst of fire hits the clan commander in the head, killing him instantly. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.)</p>
<p>His death travels like a shock wave through the other clansmen, bringing them to an abrupt halt. They abort their attack and fall back, a few of them stopping just long enough to pick up and bear his lifeless body away from the street.</p>
<p>While there is a lull in the firing, you seize the chance to help Knott and Captain Frankland clear away the debris that is blocking your escape. A thick, wooden pole, which once supported overhead electricity cables in this part of town, is jammed between the wheel and the truck’s front fender. With your help they are able to shift it, and Knott returns to the cab and starts the engine first time. Then, as he brings the truck over the mound, you and the captain leap onto the tailgate and pull yourselves aboard.</p>
<p>The street ends at a piece of wasteland but a few hundred yards beyond it lies a highway running east to west. The captain peers through the cab’s partition window and gives an ironic laugh when he sees the highway.</p>
<p>‘Make for that road and head west,’ he commands, and Knott obeys. Then he turns to the sergeant and says, ‘It looks like you’re finally outvoted, Haskell. Seems we’re on our way to Mimbres.’</p>
