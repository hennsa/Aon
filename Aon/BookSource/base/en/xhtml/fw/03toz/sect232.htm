<h3>232</h3>

<p>A barricade of wrecked autos has been strung out in a continuous line across the highway at the entrance to the town. Beyond this wall of buckled hulks, you see that the town is clan held. More than a dozen motorcycles are parked on either side of the main street, where two or three clansmen are asleep in the shade.</p>
<p>‘Why are they so interested in holding this God-forsaken place?’ you ponder aloud.</p>
<p>‘Strategically it’s important,’ replies the captain. ‘It controls the only cross-border highway through the mountains into New Mexico.’</p>
<p>The captain asks for Sergeant Haskell’s map, and after studying it, he says: ‘The town’s called Columbus. If we’re gonna reach Deming on time we’ll have to smash our way through the road block, otherwise we face a long detour on Highway 9, the Mimbres road. If we go that way we’ll have to try an’ link up with the convoy someplace else, someplace further west, like Lordsburg or San Simon. Either way it’s damn risky.’</p>
<p>Because of the risks involved, the captain puts the decision to the vote. He and Knott opt to take a detour, while Sergeant Haskell favours the direct approach. He votes to crash the road block while the clansmen are off their guard. The others wait to hear your choice.</p>
<p class="choice">If you vote to smash through the road block, <a href="sect342.htm">turn to 342</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you side with the captain and Marine Knott and vote to detour Columbus, <a href="sect177.htm">turn to 177</a>.</p>
