<h3>239</h3>

<p>The spectators’ enclosure offers enough cover for the three of you to reach a position directly opposite the parked trucks without being seen, but the minutes pass slowly as you await an opportunity to dash across the track and plant your mines. Sergeant Haskell and the captain seize the first opportunity and make it across the track safely. Once they are hidden beneath their targets they signal to you to join them as quickly as you can. Four long minutes tick by before you get the chance to reach the first truck. When it comes, you tense yourself like a coiled spring and propel yourself forward, sprinting head-down across the track towards your target. You are within a few feet of the vehicle when a Mexican clansman suddenly appears and walks directly in your path: collision is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Add together your Stealth and Perception skill totals. Now pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add the number you pick to your combined skill total.</p>
<p class="choice">If your final score is 8 or less, <a href="sect122.htm">turn to 122</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your final score is 9–13, <a href="sect204.htm">turn to 204</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your final score is 14 or more, <a href="sect333.htm">turn to 333</a>.</p>
