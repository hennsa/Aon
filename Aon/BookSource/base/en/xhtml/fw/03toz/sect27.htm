<h3>27</h3>

<p>You fire, but your aim is too high and your shot passes harmlessly over the head of the leading biker. His passenger replies by levelling his pistol, resting it on his shoulder, and squeezing off three rounds in rapid succession. The first slug clips your right shoulder and sends you reeling backwards—lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Immediately, the captain and Sergeant Haskell rush to your aid. Captain Frankland attends to your wound, (erase one Medi-kit unit from your Backpack), while the sergeant picks up your gun and returns fire at the pursuing bikers (erase from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a> the quantity of ammunition that is equal to one round of fire). Above the roar of the engines you hear the leading rider scream out in pain: Haskell has wounded him in the hand, severing a finger. He loses control, swerves violently to the left, somersaults, and then his machine bursts into flame.</p>
<p>The incident scares the other riders sufficiently for them to pull back to a safe distance. They continue to tail the truck, but at least they are now out of range.</p>
