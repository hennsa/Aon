<h3>304</h3>

<p>You watch the assassin reload his rifle with a banana-shaped magazine that he inserts in a slot in front of the trigger. Then he shoulders the weapon and takes up a pair of binocular-like field glasses, which hang from a strap around his neck. He places them to his visor and methodically scans the surrounding rooftops. It seems a curious thing to do as the buildings are very close: surely he does not need binoculars to be able to see if anyone is standing on top of them? Then a chill stabs your heart when he scans the windows and you realize that he is not using a regular pair of binoculars: they are sophisticated, high-resolution, image intensifiers.</p>
<p>Immediately you duck back from the window, but you fear that he has already located your position.</p>
