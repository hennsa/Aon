<h3>305</h3>

<p>You lean over and look along the ground at the truck ahead. There you see the captain, crouching beneath it, who signals to you to place your contact mine in position. The heavy disc locks itself against the dusty tank with a reassuring <i>clunk</i>, and you uncover its detonator button carefully. Once again the captain signals and once again you obey his command, this time by pressing the button. As soon as you hear the timing mechanism begin to tick, you close your Backpack and make a dash for the truck that Knott has commandeered.</p>
<p>Frankland and Haskell join your escape: the captain is running twenty yards ahead of you and the sergeant, who has had to place two mines, is trailing behind you by about the same distance. Knott sees you in the side mirror and starts the truck, smoke belching from the exhaust pipe as he revs the reluctant engine. The captain reaches the rear and clambers over the tailgate just as a couple of clansmen notice you running and start shouting wildly. Their screams distract your attention and you fail to notice a metal tool locker that is lying on the ground directly in your path.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth skill total.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 9 or less, <a href="sect107.htm">turn to 107</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 10 or more, <a href="sect224.htm">turn to 224</a>.</p>
