<h3>311</h3>

<p>Slowly you follow the steep trail as it ascends towards the outcrop. The climb is difficult but your perseverance is rewarded when you reach the top and discover a plateau that commands a breathtaking view of the surrounding mountain timberlands. Then, as you scan the horizon, you hear something that is far more exciting than the wondrous view: it is the sound of running water.</p>
<p>With high expectations, you and Knott re-enter the forest, determined to investigate the sound. You have covered less than fifty yards when you discover the source: a spring of clear, sparkling water cascading from a crack in the mountainside. Knott is elated by the find and rushes forward to drink his fill. You are more cautious: you control the strong urge to drink and warn your companion of the high possibility that the water is contaminated.</p>
