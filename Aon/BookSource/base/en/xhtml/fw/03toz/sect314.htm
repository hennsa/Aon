<h3>314</h3>

<p>Halfway along the main street you discover a used car lot that specialized in commercial and recreational vehicles. The faded billboards boast that ‘only the best vehicles are to be found here’, but sadly this claim is long out-of-date. Most of the trucks and RVs are totally wrecked, and nearly all have tyres and batteries that have perished during the post-holocaust years. A battered Toyota pick-up rests on its side, hardly warranting a second glance until you notice that its tyres are still sound. Knott helps you to heave it back onto all four wheels and then goes to fetch the others while you make a closer examination of the engine. Apart from a dead battery and lack of fuel, the pick-up is in remarkably good condition.</p>
<p>You are checking the air filter when the others arrive. Although they have not been able to locate a vehicle in better condition, their search has not been entirely fruitless. They did find some gasolene, which Sergeant Haskell proceeds to pour into the pick-up’s fuel tank.</p>
<p>‘That solves one problem,’ you say, as you replace the air filter, ‘but we’ll still need some electrical power to get this engine started.’</p>
