<h3>327</h3>

<p>Moments later there is a crash of breaking glass and you catch sight of something vaguely resembling a can of food as it flies through the window. It bounces on the carpeted floor and immediately there is a flash, followed by a stream of sickly, cream-coloured gas that shoots from its base. As the gas fills the room rapidly, your throat tightens and your eyes stream. A wave of nausea hits you and frantically you rush from the room before it fills to the ceiling with noxious tear gas: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Coughing and retching, you stagger along the corridor and down a flight of stairs that leads to a fire exit at the rear of the building. Desperate for clean air, you kick its locking bar and stumble out into the courthouse yard. You have taken just two steps when the assassin comes rushing around the corner of the courthouse with his rifle in his hand.</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="sect270.htm">turn to 270</a>.</p>
