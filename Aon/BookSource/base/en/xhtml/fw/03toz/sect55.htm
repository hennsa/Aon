<h3>55</h3>

<p>Your enemy screams and clutches at his chest as you deliver your killing blow. He falls backwards, and, as he rolls towards the tailgate, you notice a Pistol holstered on the rear of his belt. (If you wish to keep this weapon, you discover that it contains ten rounds of 9mm ammunition.)</p>
<p>You rush forward to help Sergeant Haskell deal with his attacker. With your aid, he is able to prise the hands of his enemy from around his throat and, with a double-footed kick to the chest, send him tumbling backwards out of the truck. You are bundling your dead adversary after him when Knott overcomes his panic and manages to restart the engine. With a jolt the truck turns sharply to the left, and the bulldozer rumbles past with barely inches to spare.</p>
<p>In an attempt to escape from the town, Knott heads towards a narrow side street, but as soon as you enter you are confronted by another hazard. Several of the houses that back on to the street have collapsed and the debris has formed a huge, uneven mound, completely blocking your path. Knott, confident that the truck is capable of scaling this obstacle, shifts the gear selector into all-wheel drive and stamps his foot on the gas pedal. Amid a whine of gears, the truck accelerates towards the mountain of bricks and shattered timbers, hitting the mound at speed. The truck lurches towards the peak, but shudders to a halt less than five feet from the top.</p>
<p>Knott and the captain both leap from the cab, desperate to clear away the debris that has jammed the front wheels. As they begin work, three clansmen come running around the corner, firing their weapons as they sprint towards the truck. Haskell answers them with a burst of fire that fells the leading two, and sends the survivor scurrying for cover. However, this does little to deter the attack. More clansmen are appearing by the second, and you can tell by their blood-curdling screams that they do not intend to take prisoners.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a missile weapon and wish to fire at the advancing clansmen, <a href="sect69.htm">turn to 69</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to help the captain and Marine Knott clear away debris from the front wheels, <a href="sect3.htm">turn to 3</a>.</p>
