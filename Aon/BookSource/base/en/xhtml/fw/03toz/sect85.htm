<h3>85</h3>

<p>Knott screams, and you see his head forced flat against his shoulder by the impact of the sniper’s bullet. Crab-like he staggers sideways, and then for a few brief seconds he seems to defy gravity before finally crashing to the ground. You rush to his side to find dark blood trickling from beneath his hairline; instinctively you know that it is already too late to help him.</p>
<p>A rush of adrenaline, triggered by the anger and resentment you feel towards Knott’s assassin, surges through your veins and spurs you to immediate action. You grab your gun and scurry towards the steps, seeking cover there below the lip of the crater. A second shot rings out and a high-velocity bullet kicks up a column of dust within inches of your face. As you duck, you see the muzzle flash and pinpoint the assassin’s position among some foliage, twenty yards away to your left. You know that for as long as you keep your head below ground level you will be safe from his rifle. You also know that he can move to another position whenever he chooses.</p>
<p>Cautiously you glance over the lip of the crater, looking for somewhere safer to hide, and spot a clump of dense foliage less than ten yards from the steps.</p>
