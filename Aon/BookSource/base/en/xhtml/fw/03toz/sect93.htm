<h3>93</h3>

<p>By keeping strictly to the alleys and side streets you are able to make your way deep into the heart of the city, avoiding the numerous clan patrols. At length you reach the banks of the Rio Grande and follow the river westwards towards your rendezvous destination. Your early encounters with Mad Dog’s men have delayed you and now, as you hurry along the walkways and plazas bordering the river, you are fearful that you will arrive too late to join the others. You are hurrying along a walled sidewalk when you catch sight of the Stanton Street Toll Bridge less than 400 yards away. You are confident that it is the right bridge for it is the only one still intact. A glance at your wristwatch shows that you have less than ten minutes to spare.</p>
<p>‘The bridge is over there,’ Marine Knott says. ‘It’ll only take a few minutes to reach it. If all’s well, the captain and Sergeant Haskell should be there already waitin’ for us.’</p>
<p>You set off, soon reaching a cluster of old US immigration offices standing at the approach to the bridge. As Knott predicted, Frankland and Haskell are waiting for you to show and, as you approach the buildings, they call you over to join them. They have already scouted the bridge and determined that there are four clan guards on the bridge itself, but none at all on the service walkway that runs beneath it.</p>
<p>‘We’ve less than an hour before the explosives are due to arrive,’ says the captain, checking his watch. ‘Is everyone ready?’</p>
<p>You nod in unison. ‘OK then. Let’s go!’</p>
