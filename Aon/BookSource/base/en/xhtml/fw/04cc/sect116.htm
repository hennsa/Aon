<h3>116</h3>

<p>You disappear behind the barbecue range moments before the clansman’s bullets tear into the brickwork with shattering effect. You hear the chatter of a second gun, and then suddenly there is silence. Cautiously you peer around the corner of your brick shield to see Rickenbacker walking towards you, changing the magazine of his machine pistol as he wends his way through the ranges.</p>
<p>A few feet away you see a pair of booted feet. You move out further until the whole of the clansman’s body is visible. His hands are twitching, and then abruptly they relax, as if resigned to the fate that has befallen the rest of the body.</p>
<p>As Rickenbacker comes nearer he calls out your name. His face is lined with worry until you pull yourself to your feet and acknowledge his call.</p>
