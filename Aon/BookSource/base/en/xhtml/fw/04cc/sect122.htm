<h3>122</h3>

<p>You fire a short burst and see the clansman shudder as a line of bullet holes appears across his chest. (Remember to deduct six rounds of 9mm ammunition from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) A second later he returns fire, but the impact of your slugs has diverted his aim and his bullet passes harmlessly over your shoulder. He staggers and falls. No sooner has his body hit the dirt than one of his screaming comrades leaps over him and dives straight at you with his hands outstretched. Before you can fire again, he grapples the machine pistol from your hands, and then lunges forwards to fasten his steely fingers around your throat.</p>

<p>Owing to the suddenness of the attack, you cannot make use of a close combat weapon until the second round of combat.</p>
