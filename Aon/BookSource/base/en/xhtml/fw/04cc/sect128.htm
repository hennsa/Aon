<h3>128</h3>

<p>As you struggle with your enemy, you hear a single shot and feel the strength draining from his hands. Suddenly he releases his grip on you altogether and a gurgling croak issues from his mouth. With some difficulty, you manage to push him aside and, as he rolls away into the base of the hollow, you see Kate nearby with a smoking revolver in her hand:</p>
<p>‘I guess that makes us quits,’ you say, referring to the time, only days before, when your successful search for Atropine saved her life.</p>
<p>‘I guess so,’ she replies, ‘but who’s counting?’</p>
<p>Shortly after, two more clansmen attempt to copy their actions, but end up exactly the same way—lying in a tangled heap on the railroad tracks. For a minute there is a lull in the fighting; then you spot a new threat taking shape.</p>
