<h3>132</h3>

<p>Your burst of gunfire hits both of the riflemen, sending them tumbling over the edge of the parapet. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) The remaining clansman, whom you first saw seated next to the parapet, cowers on the ground like a frightened child as you rush across the roof. His hands have been tied behind his back and, as you bend to grab hold of his arms to pull him to his feet, he pleads for his life. ‘Don’t kill me, please don’t kill me,’ he cries. ‘I’ll help you; I can help you, if you’ll just let me live.’</p>
<p>You shout an all clear to Rickenbacker in the street below, and, as you turn your face away, you see the headlights of the convoy vehicles as they enter the town.</p>
<p>Without untying his hands, you escort the clansman down slowly from the roof and retrace your steps along the alley that leads back to the main street.</p>
