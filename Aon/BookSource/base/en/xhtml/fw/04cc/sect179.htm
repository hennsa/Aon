<h3>179</h3>

<p>More than twenty colonists step forward and volunteer themselves in the defence of the convoy, even though they know that the action could cost them their lives. Among the volunteers, you see many familiar faces: Rickenbacker, Macy, Langdon, Avenal, and the Tyler brothers are among them. Also, to your surprise, you see Kate. She is not completely recovered from her illness, but she is determined not to let that stop her. Suddenly you feel deeply ashamed, especially when you look at Kate. She returns your stare, and, although she does not speak, her look is enough to say it all. At once you realize that to continue to Pine Valley without her would be unbearable, so you swallow your fears and step forward to join her. As you stand by her side, you feel her warm hand touch yours and then squeeze it reassuringly.</p>
