<h3>187</h3>

<p>With the tyre gone, you find yourself fighting with the steering wheel to keep the roadster progressing in a straight line. But you cannot correct the skid in time and the vehicle slews wildly across the main street. With a tremendous crash, it smashes into the front of a hardware store, hurling you and Rickenbacker out of your seats and into a tangle of shattered timbers and splintered glass.</p>
<p>Stunned and bleeding, you drag yourself to your feet and stumble towards your partner’s body. You try to reach out to him but your arms, both broken at the elbows, refuse to obey your commands. Then, in the midst of the carnage, you hear a gruff voice cursing and you turn to face it. A clansman stands silhouetted in the twilit street, his features obscured by shadows. There is a pinpoint flash from his hand: it is the last thing you see before you are enveloped by a darkness that is timeless and total.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your adventure and your life end here in Wellton.</p>
