<h3>192</h3>

<p>The clansman groans as your snap shot hits him between the shoulder blades. For a moment he shudders, and then he arches his back and falls from the doorway to land in a heap at the bottom of the steps. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.)</p>
<p>At once you leap out from behind the garbage cart and run to the bus to check that Kate is all right. Inside you discover both her and your Aunt Betty-Ann sheltering behind the rear seats. They are shaken but appear otherwise unharmed.</p>
<p>You have only just helped them to their feet when Rickenbacker appears at the doorway. ‘C’mon, Cal. We’ve gotta get back to the roadster. Macy reports more Outlaws at the edge of town. We’ve got to lead the convoy outta here.’</p>
<p>Kate and Aunt Betty-Ann say they are all right, and urge you to do as your partner says. The colonists are beginning to return to their vehicles and, as you follow Rickenbacker across the plaza towards your roadster, it worries you to note that several of them are nursing wounds.</p>
<p>Once you are back behind the wheel, you signal to Cutter and the others to follow your lead and then power your car out of Sentinel, along Interstate 8.</p>
