<h3>205</h3>

<p>Your gunfire knocks one of the group to the ground, but an empty shell case has become jammed in the breech of your gun, preventing you from firing a second burst. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your <a href="action.htm">Ammo Pouch</a>.) Shouldering your gun, you draw a close combat weapon and jump onto the roof. As you move swiftly towards the group, the clansman, who is sitting with his back to the parapet, sees you approaching. A wave of fear knots your stomach as you wait expectantly for him to shout out in alarm. However, to your surprise, he does nothing to alert his companions.</p>
<p>Instinct prompts you to act quickly in case he has a change of heart. You rush forward and lunge at the throat of the remaining rifleman. He dodges your blow, but in doing so drops his rifle over the edge of the parapet. Before he has a chance to draw a knife, you press home your advantage and attack again.</p>
