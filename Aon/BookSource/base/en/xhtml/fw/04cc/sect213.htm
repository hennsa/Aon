<h3>213</h3>

<p>It takes a little over an hour to clear a path through the landslide. After an inspection, Cutter pronounces that the pass is once again passable, and he urges everyone to hurry back to their vehicles and get ready to press on without delay.</p>
<p>You lead the procession of vehicles successfully across the cleared ground and through the pass beyond. Then, as you emerge on the far side of the pass, you see Cutter signalling to you to stop. The convoy halts for a few minutes to allow him to go back and plant some grenades beneath one of the remaining outcrops. He sets the timers, allowing himself enough time to return to the convoy.</p>
<p>Patiently you wait for the grenades to detonate. When they explode, they bring down a mass of rock that seals off the pass behind the convoy.</p>
<p>‘That should delay the Outlaws for a while,’ he says, and almost cheerfully returns to take his place behind the wheel of DC1’s school bus.</p>
<p>It is mid-afternoon by the time you lead the convoy into the ruins of Sentinel. The town is deserted, and you are about to drive through without stopping when you see something in your rear-view mirror that makes you slam on the brakes. Fire is billowing out of the Landcruiser’s luggage store, which is situated directly beneath the floor of the passenger compartment and adjacent to the fuel tanks. The driver and the passengers seem unaware of the danger they are in—until you bring the convoy to a halt and run back to warn them.</p>
<p>‘Fire!’ you shout, as you race along the line of vehicles towards the stricken bus. Suddenly the colonists aboard the Landcruiser realize what is wrong and frantically they leap out of the burning vehicle, through windows and doors, to avoid the rising flames.</p>
