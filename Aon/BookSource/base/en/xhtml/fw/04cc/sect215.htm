<h3>215</h3>

<p>As you approach the crumpled bodies, you hear the growl of a powerful car engine and turn to see the grey Trans-sol approaching from the freeway exit. You wave to show Macy and Langdon that you are both OK, and they return a thumbs-up as they halt outside the bank.</p>
<p>‘These jokers were clan members, but how do we know they’re Shiloh’s men?’ you ask, pointing at the lifeless bodies.</p>
<p>‘They’re Outlaws all right,’ says Macy, motioning to the clansmen’s car. ‘That skull-’n’-crossbones scrawled on the driver’s door is their mark, sure ’nough.’</p>
<p>While the others dispose of the bodies, you take the opportunity to search the drugstore. You are curious to know what it was that the clansmen were looking for, and it does not take long to find out. A large cardboard container lies on its side near the door, dropped there no doubt when you and Rickenbacker made your unexpected appearance. Spilled out across the floor are bottles of pain killers and stimulants, and syringes that the clansmen have looted from the drugstore’s safe.</p>
<p>You sift through the contents and quickly scan the store’s shelves for useful items. Your search uncovers enough medical supplies for four Medi-kit units. When you return to the others, they offer you the remainder of the items that were found on the clansmen’s bodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shotgun</li>
<li>Knife (2)</li>
<li>Two rounds of 12-gauge ammunition</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to keep any of these items, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect104.htm">turn to 104</a>.</p>
