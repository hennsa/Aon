<h3>221</h3>

<p>‘The convoy’ll be here in less than five minutes,’ says Rickenbacker, as he cocks his machine pistol. ‘Let’s see what we can do to make their welcome a little more friendly, shall we?’</p>
<p>With that he rises from his knees and empties an entire magazine at the clansmen’s position. While he is firing, you chance a glance over the wing of the roadster and see an alley directly opposite. It runs beside the cinema on which the clansmen are positioned. A black Perspex awning covers most of its length, hiding it from view from anyone positioned on the surrounding rooftops.</p>
<p>When you look back, Rickenbacker is busy reloading. You tap his arm and point to the alley, saying, ‘I’m goin’ t’ try an’ get around the back. Cover me.’</p>
<p>He grunts approvingly. The moment he re-opens fire, you break cover and sprint towards the alley as fast as your legs and your lungs will allow. You are ten yards from its welcoming darkness when bullets start to thud into the ground around your feet.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add to it your Stealth skill score.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 5 or less, <a href="sect162.htm">turn to 162</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 6–9, <a href="sect292.htm">turn to 292</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is 10 or more, <a href="sect12.htm">turn to 12</a>.</p>
