<h3>225</h3>

<p>Watched by the surrounding circle of colonists, you approach the table and take a seat among your six fellow judges. A hush descends on the plaza as Pop Ewell calls for Rex Tyler to be brought forward to answer to the charge of murder. Flanked by two burly Tucson men, Rex enters the square, his head bowed and his hands tied before him. They escort him to a place in front of the table, where they untie his hands. Both men are armed with pistols, and they make it perfectly clear to Rex that they are prepared to use them if he is foolish enough to try to escape.</p>

<p>Rex is questioned at length by all the judges, including yourself, and earnestly pleads his innocence. He says that his knife, the weapon used to kill Mike Gorgas, went missing the previous evening. Your fellow judges phrase their questions cleverly in the hope of tripping Rex and finding a hole in his story, but steadfastly he holds to his statement that his knife went missing and that he happened upon Gorgas’ body by chance. When your turn to question him comes around for the final time, you decide to try a different tack. You ask him if he saw anyone in the immediate vicinity of the truck prior to discovering Mike Gorgas’ body. After much thought he says that he remembers seeing two men, both Tucson colonists. He does not know them by name, but when asked to pick them out, he scans the surrounding faces and points to John Barlow and Paul Avenal.</p>
<p>After you consult with your fellow judges, they agree to let you question these two men, who are both made to approach the table. You ask each of them in turn if he killed Mike Gorgas. Both strenuously deny having had anything to do with Gorgas’ murder. Avenal is so outraged by the proceedings that he accuses you of murdering Gorgas, and charges you with attempting to frame him. It is not until Cutter points out that you and Rickenbacker were scouting the pass at the time of Gorgas’ murder that he ceases his ranting and quietly fumes.</p>
<p>Your second request takes both men by surprise. You ask them to step forward and empty the contents of their pockets and packs onto the judges’ table. After a moment’s hesitation, the two men comply.</p>
<p>Avenal’s pockets contain the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knife</li>
<li>Cigarette Lighter</li>
<li>Tin containing three cigarettes</li>
<li>Pistol</li>
<li>Twelve rounds of 9mm ammunition</li>
<li>Screwdriver</li>
<li>Solar Torch</li>
<li>Map of Arizona</li>
<li>Bottle of pain killers</li>
</ul>
<p>Barlow’s pockets comprise the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tool Kit</li>
<li>Radio Transmitter</li>
<li>Pistol</li>
<li>Fifteen rounds of 9mm ammunition</li>
<li>Detonator Cap</li>
<li>Paper pack containing six cigarettes</li>
<li>Wire Cutters</li>
<li>Signal Flare</li>
<li>Reel of cloth tape</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have examined the items, the two men are allowed to retrieve them while you and the other judges pause to consider your verdict.</p>
<p>After a short deliberation, your fellow judges pronounce their judgements. Two find Paul Avenal guilty of the murder; two find John Barlow guilty; and two find Rex Tyler guilty as charged. As only a majority of one vote is required, the deciding vote rests with you.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide that Avenal is guilty, <a href="sect121.htm">turn to 121</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide that Barlow is guilty, <a href="sect24.htm">turn to 24</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide that Rex Tyler is guilty, <a href="sect308.htm">turn to 308</a>.</p>
