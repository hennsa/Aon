<h3>229</h3>

<p>The pain of your wounds is overwhelming. It feels as if three red-hot knives have been driven into your flesh and left there. Kate rushes to your side and cradles you in her arms, tears welling in her eyes. She is saying something, but the noise of the battle and the loud pounding of your heartbeat drown out her words.</p>
<p>Carefully, using dressings from her own Medi-kit, she patches up your wounds as best she can (restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points). Gritting your teeth against the pain, you sit up in time to see Rickenbacker putting paid to your would-be killer. His fire hits the clansman in the chest, killing him instantly. The sight of his body tumbling backwards down the slope sends a shock wave through his confederates, and at once their attack falters. Encouraged by their sudden change of heart, you watch as they fall back towards their trucks, which are parked in a line at the centre of the freeway.</p>
