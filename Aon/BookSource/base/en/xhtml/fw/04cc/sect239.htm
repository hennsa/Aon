<h3>239</h3>

<p>You bring the grenade close to your face in order to set its timer. Carefully you turn its dial to the minimum time setting—four seconds—then you ease out the pin and hurl it across the roof.</p>
<p>A searing, yellow flash is followed by a dull, percussive boom, which makes your ears pop. As the smoke clears, you see that one of the shooters lies dead, and the other is leaning against the parapet, clutching at his wounded thigh with his free hand. The seated clansman appears to have survived without injury. You draw a close combat weapon and move stealthily towards the group before the shock wears off. The seated clansman sees you approaching but, curiously, he does nothing to alert his wounded companion.</p>
<p>You act quickly. The clansman may have a badly wounded leg, but his finger is uninjured and it is curled around the trigger of his assault rifle. You rush him and kick the gun out of his hands, sending it sailing over the parapet. Before it hits the ground, you press home your advantage and attack.</p>

<p>Owing to the surprise of your attack and the weakened state of your adversary, ignore any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point losses that you sustain during the first two rounds of combat.</p>
