<h3>243</h3>

<p>Slowly you make the return journey across the mountains and reach Mohawk, and the expectant colony, late in the afternoon. The two of you are welcomed back like conquering heroes, and Jaeger is thanked especially. His help in replenishing the colony’s water supply has undoubtedly saved many lives.</p>
<p>A queue forms to draw water from the pick-up and, as you are first in line, you draw Kate’s ration and deliver it to her in person. She is still recovering aboard the bus, but you are relieved to see that she looks much healthier than when you saw her last during the clan attack at Sentinel. You stay with her and talk about your hopes for the journey ahead, assuring her that soon you will be safely in California and free at last from the perils of the road. (During the time you spend with Kate you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>Sometime later, Cutter enters the bus to tell you that the convoy will be moving out in ten minutes. The colony leaders feel that Mohawk is too vulnerable to a clan night attack and they want to reach Wellton, a town twenty-six miles to the west, and set up camp there. You are not too happy about their decision, but you choose not to argue and, after saying a fond farewell to Kate, you join Rickenbacker, who is waiting for you in the roadster.</p>
