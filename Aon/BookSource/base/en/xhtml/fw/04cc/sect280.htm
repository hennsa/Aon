<h3>280</h3>

<p>The grenade bounces in front of the truck, rolls, and then comes to rest directly beneath its fuel tank. A few seconds pass, and then there is a huge <i>bang</i>, followed almost immediately by a huge ball of orange flame. A searing wave of heat knocks you flat on your back and leaves you gasping for air: lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point.</p>
<p>In the rear of the truck was loaded a keg of blasting powder, and this, coupled with the vehicle’s gasolene, has produced a spectacularly devastating explosion.</p>
<p>The noise alerts the other clansmen and suddenly all hell breaks loose. They leap to their feet and come running across the bridge, cursing and fumbling for their weapons as they do so. Through a pall of falling dust you hobble to where Rickenbacker is hiding and lower yourself into the ditch beside him.</p>
<p>‘What the heck was that?’ he gasps, stunned by the unexpected force of the explosion.</p>
<p>‘They must have had some explosives on board,’ you reply. ‘I think it’s safe to say the radio’s been destroyed!’</p>
<p>As the dust clears slowly, you see the clansmen running towards the blazing remains of their truck. As they get nearer, you take up your gun and prepare to open fire.<sup><a href="#sect280-1-foot" name="sect280-1">7</a></sup></p>
