<h3>300</h3>

<p>Your partner confirms that the town is empty of clansmen. He radios the convoy, telling them as much, and shortly after receiving his call the colony arrives.</p>
<p>You spend a trouble-free night at Glamis and, a little after dawn the next morning, you and Rickenbacker set off to scout Highway 78. As has become standard practice, you drive two miles ahead of the colony and report back to them regularly by radio. During your drive west, you pass over several small bridges that cross canals running north from the Colorado River to the Salton Sea. This area was extensively cultivated at the turn of the century, to produce the extra food required to feed the rapidly growing urban populations of Los Angeles and San Diego. Now all that remains is a storm-ravaged wasteland.</p>
<p>The journey passes without incident until you reach a highway junction. A mass of tents and bivouacs have been erected here, partially covering the road ahead.</p>
