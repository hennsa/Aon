<h3>309</h3>

<p>Having chosen to block the exit, you and Rickenbacker drive off the freeway and make a wide detour around the town while Macy and Langdon wait patiently. As soon as you are in position on the far side, they bring their Trans-sol to within fifty yards of the suspect clan car, halt, and then rush forward on foot. You watch them disappear among the buildings, and then less than a minute later, you hear gunfire and see three mean-looking clansmen come running into the main street, shouting and firing behind them as they scurry towards their vehicle.</p>
<p>With tyres squealing, the car comes racing through the town, heading straight for the freeway ramp where you and your partner lie in wait.</p>
<p>‘Hey, these guys ain’t gonna stop,’ says Rickenbacker, as he climbs out of the passenger seat and takes cover behind the trunk.</p>
<p>‘Sure is rude to leave in such a hurry,’ you reply. ‘Guess we’ll just have to teach ’em some manners.’</p>
<p>The clan car is 200 yards away and closing fast when a machine pistol appears at the passenger window. Immediately you see a muzzle flash and a stream of bullets peppers the side of your car, making you duck your head involuntarily.</p>
<p>‘They’re gonna ram us!’ screams Rickenbacker.</p>
<p>‘OK. Let ’em have it,’ you shout, and as one, you and your partner stand up and take aim at the oncoming enemy.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to aim at the car’s windshield, <a href="sect123.htm">turn to 123</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to aim at the vehicle’s front tyres, <a href="sect65.htm">turn to 65</a>.</p>
