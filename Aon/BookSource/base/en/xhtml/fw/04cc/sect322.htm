<h3>322</h3>

<p>There is an eerie silence as you and Rickenbacker survey the tangled wreckage from the top of the freeway ramp. The bodies of the three clansmen lie where they fell on the embankment below. Although you look closely for some sign of life, there is none to be seen: all three were killed outright when they were hurled from their vehicles.</p>
<p>Then the quiet is disturbed by the growl of a powerful car engine. You look towards the town and see the grey Trans-sol approaching the freeway, and you wave to reassure Macy and Langdon that you and your partner are OK. They wave back and then pull up alongside your roadster.</p>
<p>‘They were Outlaws all right,’ says Macy, looking down at the remains of the clansman’s car. ‘That skull-’n’-crossbones scrawled on the driver’s door is their mark, sure ’nough.’</p>
<p>While the others go to investigate the wreckage and bury the dead clansmen, you stay with your roadster and check to make sure that all is well. When they return, they offer you a choice of items salvaged from the crash:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pistol</li>
<li>Knife (2)</li>
<li>Five rounds of 9mm ammunition</li>
<li>Antiseptic dressings (enough for one Medi-kit unit)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to keep any of these items, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
