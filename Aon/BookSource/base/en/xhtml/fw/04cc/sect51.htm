<h3>51</h3>

<p>You push the dead clansman away from you and turn to see Rickenbacker grappling with his partner. He looks like he has the upper hand until a blow to the side of his head sends him reeling to the ground. The Outlaw cackles and reaches for a knife sheathed at his belt, but Rickenbacker is too quick for him. He draws the blade he carries concealed in his boot, and hurls it at the grinning clansman, catching him in the throat. With a thin, bubbling scream, the Outlaw grasps the hilt and tries to wrench it free. But his strength, like his life’s blood, is deserting him. With a shudder, his limbs stiffen, and then he goes limp and drops in a heap to the ground.</p>
<p>‘That was a close call,’ says Rickenbacker, as he bends over the Outlaw and retrieves his blade. ‘Damn close call.’</p>
<p>You search the clansmen’s bodies before hiding them, together with their bikes, beneath the Santa Rosa bridge. Your search uncovers the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binoculars</li>
<li>Water Canteen</li>
<li>Enough water for two Drinks</li>
<li>Knife (2)</li>
<li>Dagger (2)</li>
<li>Two Machine Pistols</li>
<li>Twenty-eight rounds of 9mm ammunition</li>
<li>Pistol</li>
<li>HE Grenade</li>
<li>Tool Kit</li>
<li>Enough food for one Meal</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to keep any of these items, adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>After checking that the two Outlaws were alone, you leave the bridge and go north in search of a suitable place to cross the Santa Rosa Wash.</p>
