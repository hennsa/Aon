<h3>Rules for Combat</h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points are given in the text. Grey Star’s aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Grey Star’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> and <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points and the enemy’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your current <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> total, based on the weapon you are using. (Remember, if you enter combat without your Staff, you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points.)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">If you are using your Wizard’s Staff</a>, decide how many <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you wish to use. (Remember, you must expend at least 1 point.) Enter this number on your Combat Record in the box marked <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>.<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
Grey Star (<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 15, <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> 23) is ambushed by a Deathgaunt (<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but he can use his Wizard’s Staff against the creature as it swoops down on him. He subtracts the Deathgaunt’s <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −5. (15 − 20 = −5). −5 is noted on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio. Grey Star decides to use 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, which is noted on the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> box of the Combat Record.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>When you have decided upon the number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you wish to use and have determined your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="crtable.htm">Combat Results Table</a> on the inside back cover of the book. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked. (The random numbers appear on the side of the chart.) You now have the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost by Grey Star. To calculate the number lost by the enemy, multiply the number listed for the enemy by the number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points that Grey Star elected to use. Now you have the final number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost by both Grey Star and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GS represents points lost by Grey Star.)<br /><br />
Example<br /><br />
The Combat Ratio between Grey Star and the Deathgaunt has been established as −5, and Grey Star’s <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points used as 2. If the number taken from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Grey Star loses 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</li>
<li>Deathgaunt loses 5 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points, multiplied by 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, giving a total of 10 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost in all.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to the participants in the combat, and Grey Star’s amended <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="cmbtrulz.htm#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points of either the enemy or Grey Star are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Grey Star is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Grey Star proceeds but with his <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> and <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="crsumary.htm">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Grey Star may lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
