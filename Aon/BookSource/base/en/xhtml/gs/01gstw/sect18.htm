<h3>18</h3>

<p>It appears your new companions put great faith in your leadership: a faith that is only slightly shaken when you admit that you have very little idea of where to go. You explain that your quest is to find the Lost Tribe of Lara (though you do not tell them its origin or true purpose), and suggest that Shan guides you. ‘There is no obligation upon you to remain with me, though,’ you tell Tanith and Shan. ‘You are free to do as you please.’</p>
<p>‘I, for one, have no other place to go,’ says Tanith. ‘Mother Magri was a cruel mistress and I would gladly aid any opponent of the rule of the Wytch-king and his servants.’</p>
<p>‘And I, too,’ says Shan. ‘But which way shall we go? We must keep moving, for it is certain that the Shadakine are searching for us.’</p>

<p>There is a pause while you all consider the problem. Finally you ask if they have any suggestions. Shan’s advice is to journey south to the Azanam, which he believes to be the most likely haunt of the lost tribe, and he offers to guide you there.</p>
<p>‘But if you are wrong,’ says Tanith, ‘we will have journeyed far and into great danger unnecessarily. We need guidance. Three days’ travel to the north of here lives Jnana the Wise, a hermit sage, “He Who Serves No Master”. I can take you to him.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Medallion of the ‘Redeemer’ <em>and</em> the Vial of Pink Liquid, <a href="sect264.htm">turn to 264</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to take Shan’s advice, <a href="sect190.htm">turn to 190</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to seek the counsel of Jnana the Wise, <a href="sect134.htm">turn to 134</a>.</p>
