<h3>21</h3>

<p>You journey along the road and, to Shan’s surprise, discover that it is deserted. ‘I can’t understand it,’ he says, puzzled. ‘This road is usually teeming with traders.’</p>
<p>You have been walking for three hours when you sight a wagon parked by the roadside. A group of men are sitting around a campfire near a small grove of trees. ‘Wait here,’ says Shan. ‘I’ll see if I can get some information out of these merchants about the road that lies ahead.’</p>
<p>He returns shortly, carrying a short sword. He smiles broadly. ‘A bargain,’ he says. ‘Only 5 Nobles. It must be worth at least 20. Always ready to strike a bargain with a fool,’ he beams.</p>
<p>‘What about the road?’ asks Tanith, impatiently. ‘Why is it empty?’</p>
<p>‘The Shadakine are searching for us,’ he replies. ‘The roads and bridges have been closed until they discover us. These merchants were stranded and have made camp.’</p>
<p>‘We’ll have to keep to the cover of the forest from now on,’ you say, worried. You enter the forest and continue your journey cautiously.</p>
