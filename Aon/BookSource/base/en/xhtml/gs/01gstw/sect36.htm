<h3>36</h3>

<p>‘My name is Tanith,’ the girl announces. ‘What’s yours?’ You tell her your name, still stunned at her apparent coldness.</p>
<p>‘I am learning the ways of witchcraft in the service of Mother Magri,’ she continues. ‘She says you’re a wizard; is that true?’</p>
<p>‘Of course,’ you reply, a little boastfully. For some reason, you wish to impress this beautiful, young girl with wild, unkempt hair—all ragged and black—and penetrating, green eyes.</p>
<p>‘That is very bad. Mother Magri will have you tortured as an enemy of the Wytch-king. She will take you to the Darkling Room.’</p>
<p>‘Then I must escape,’ you blurt out. ‘Can you help me?’</p>
<p>‘I’ve often dreamed of leaving here,’ she says wistfully. ‘Perhaps you could take me with you?’</p>
<p>‘Yes … yes,’ you say, willing her to aid you. She pauses, a blank expression on her face. ‘But it would take more than a boy and a fat man to do that,’ she snaps angrily, suddenly breaking into peals of girlish laughter. And she flounces away wearing a smug expression, and leaving you with your hopes shattered.</p>
<p>‘She must have come to taunt us,’ says Shan. ‘Such spiteful people these Shadakine!’ You finish your food and try to conceive a plan that will gain your freedom.</p>
