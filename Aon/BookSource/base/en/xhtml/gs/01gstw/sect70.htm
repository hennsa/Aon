<h3>70</h3>

<p>You focus your thoughts in meditation, weaving a web of enchantment and attempting to influence the minds of the Shadakine warriors who are fighting on the bridge. Suddenly the Shadakine officer in command turns and sees the crossbowmen. His face contorts in fury. He barks a command and ten of his warriors turn and charge towards the crossbowmen who look on in amazement. You have created the illusion that the crossbowmen are Knights of the White Mountain and, believing that the enemy are challenging their rear, the Shadakine have turned to attack this new threat. The use of this Magical Power has cost you 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points.</p>
<p>With a blood-curdling cry, the Shadakine warriors hurl themselves at the line of crossbowmen who instantly loose a volley of crossbow bolts, killing five of their fellow countrymen. The crossbowmen then throw down their weapons and flee along the road with the remainder of their outraged comrades chasing at their heels.</p>
<p class="choice">If you now wish to fire at the remaining Shadakine warriors on the bridge from the safety of your hiding place, <a href="sect88.htm">turn to 88</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to charge into the fray, <a href="sect156.htm">turn to 156</a>.</p>
