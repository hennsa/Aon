<h2>The Game Rules</h2>

<p>If you have already completed <a href="../../gs/01gstw/title.htm"><cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite></a> (<a href="../../gs/01gstw/title.htm">Book 1</a> of the World of Lone Wolf series), you already have your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> and <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points and your Magical Powers. In the course of your adventure your powers of wizardry have grown and so you may add 10 to your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> total<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> and choose one more <a href="powers.htm">Magical Power</a>.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> All weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of <a href="../../gs/01gstw/title.htm">Book 1</a> should be entered on a fresh <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. You are now ready to begin this adventure.</p>
<p>If this is your first adventure, read on … </p>
<p>To keep a record of your adventure, use the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Before you set off on your adventure, you must discover how well your Shianti masters have prepared you for your quest by determining your fighting prowess—<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>—your state of mind—<span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>—and your physical stamina—<span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. To do this take a pencil and, with eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of 14). When you fight, your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> represents your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would have a <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> of 26). If you decide to use a spell or utilize the power of your Wizard’s Staff, then you will lose <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you may not use any of your spells<sup><a href="#gamerulz-4-foot" name="gamerulz-4">3</a></sup> or your Wizard’s Staff.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-3-foot" name="gamerulz-3">4</a></sup> Lost <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, and it is possible for your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p>The third number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (e.g. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points). If you are wounded in combat, you will lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure but can never rise above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>

<div id="footnotes">
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-1-foot" href="#gamerulz-1">1</a>] If you have completed <cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite>, your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score will be zero before you begin this book. It doesn’t seem fair to start this book with only 10 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, so you may choose to create a new <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score by choosing a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and adding 20. You may also choose to add the 10 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point bonus to this new score.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use your original <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score from the beginning of <cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite>, and add 10 bonus points to this.</p>
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-2-foot" href="#gamerulz-2">2</a>] If you choose Alchemy as your new Magical Power, you also receive a Herb Pouch with contents, as detailed in the <a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a> section.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-4-foot" href="#gamerulz-4">3</a>] There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/sect175.htm">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, then you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point you lack (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point). If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score.</p>
<p>[<a name="gamerulz-3-foot" href="#gamerulz-3">4</a>] It is possible for your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p></div>
