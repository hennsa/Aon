<h3>125</h3>

<p>Water explodes around you as you hit the lake. You career downwards, water swirling and bubbling all about you, until you hit the bottom. Fortunately, the water has slowed your descent and you survive the fall without injury.</p>
<p>Although encumbered by your Backpack and Staff, you manage to kick out strongly towards the surface, your lungs bursting for air. Emerging into the air, gasping for breath and choking, you look around for some sign of Urik. Moments later, he breaks through the surface of the water, grinning fiercely. ‘Greetings, Wizard,’ he says, spitting water and coughing, ‘you are well?’ You give a curt nod before splashing towards a sandy islet.</p>
<p>The islet is located near the centre of the lake. Dense clumps of reeds surround its dull, green waters and beyond them, you can hear the shouts of the Shadakine as they seek you out. ‘We must hide—get away from here. We’re too exposed,’ you say urgently to Urik, making to step into the water. You feel Urik’s restraining hand on your shoulder.</p>
<p>‘Wait!’ he says, pointing ahead. You follow the direction of his arm. A host of multi-coloured birds has taken off in alarm from the surface of the lake. The blur of colour draws your eye to something immediately below them that is moving straight towards you.</p>
<p>Two pale eyes on slender stalks protrude above the water, cold and emotionless, their irises no more than red slashes. ‘Eijalfish,’ says Urik. ‘Very big. Very poisonous. Very dangerous! And now, Shadakine come … is not good.’ Sure enough, you hear the sound of the Shadakine hunting party, beating at the dense foliage as they draw closer. In a few minutes, they are sure to discover you, stranded here in the middle of the lake.</p>
