<h3>144</h3>

<p>With the evil cunning that you have come to expect of the Shadakine, they use their slaves as a human wall, thus preventing the masked attackers from bringing their full force to bear for fear of killing the innocent people they have come to free.</p>
<p>You notice that the chains that manacle the slaves are all linked to one metal ring at the end of the line. If you can break the chain at this point, you will be able to free all the slaves at a stroke. Standing by this link-pin is the Shadakine slavemaster. Fearlessly, you charge. The slavemaster’s eyes widen with surprise but he appears unshaken by your advance. He clutches at a red Gem at his neck and, as he does, his personal slave steps forward. Seven feet tall and with powerful muscles bulging beneath his ebony skin, he fixes you with a blank expression as he raises his huge broadsword.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the black giant, <a href="sect179.htm">turn to 179</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to unleash a long-range attack on the slavemaster, <a href="sect196.htm">turn to 196</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Sorcery and wish to use it, <a href="sect266.htm">turn to 266</a>.</p>
