<h3>151</h3>

<p>Hardly daring to breathe, you and Urik remain crouched within the dense marsh grass. A Shadakine warrior pauses to look around only a few yards from your hiding place. He takes a step towards you, and then gives a startled cry as he sinks into the quicksand which once held you. His cries for help alert a number of his fellow warriors who come to his aid, hurling jeers and insults at his apparent stupidity.</p>
<p>Urik gives a satisfied nod and gestures for you to follow him. With quiet, tentative steps, you move away from the clamour of the Shadakine warriors, exploiting this unexpected distraction to the full. When Urik is satisfied that you have placed a sufficient distance between you and your enemy, he motions for you to sit down. With sure hands he breaks the quarrel that is embedded in your shoulder. ‘Make no sound,’ whispers Urik, before pulling the bolt. You grit your teeth as he tugs at the shaft and ‘swallow’ the pain. A shallow stream trickles close by and he uses its waters to clean the wound. ‘There is good medicine here,’ he says, plunging his hand into the stream and withdrawing a fistful of mud, which he daubs liberally over your injury. The mud feels cool against the throbbing pain of your shoulder and, as it dries, it staunches the bleeding. You thank Urik for his aid.</p>
<p>Suddenly a chilling howl reaches your ears, sending a shiver of fear down your spine. Cautiously, Urik rises to peer along the tops of the chest-high marsh grass, searching for the source of the howl. He quickly ducks his head and turns to speak, a worried look on his face. He tells you that the Shadakine have hunting dogs and are preparing to release them. They are the Magdi: ferocious hounds with two heads—the creation of the Wytch-king Shasarak.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stand and fight the Magdi, <a href="sect123.htm">turn to 123</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you prefer to run from the Magdi, following the shallow waterway that cuts through the grass, <a href="sect156.htm">turn to 156</a>.</p>
