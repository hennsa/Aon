<h3>155</h3>

<p>The confidence of the Shadakine is visibly shaken when your discharge of fiery magic completely incinerates a warrior. The use of your Staff has cost you 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. You are amazed, your powers seem greatly increased since last you used them. A blast as potent as the one you have just released would normally have drained a great deal of your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>. You smile with grim satisfaction as the shocked Shadakine dive for cover.</p>
<p>The Shadakine officer is quickly trying to restore order as the shaken Shadakine scramble behind the cover of the tall marsh grass. He orders them to ready weapons and prepare to fire. Soon, the Shadakine will be able to bring the full force of their weapons against you. You feel that you are in a hopeless situation. The Shadakine are not short of supplies and will be content to wait out this siege. Meanwhile, you have no food and no cover.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to swim away, <a href="sect5.htm">turn to 5</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Magical Power of Prophecy an wish to foresee the outcome of your predicament, <a href="sect128.htm">turn to 128</a>.</p>
