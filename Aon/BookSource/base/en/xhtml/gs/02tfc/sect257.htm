<h3>257</h3>

<p>You soon realize that Urik’s eccentric, shambling gait is not due to senility, but is one that he has adapted to suit his environment: his bow legs, the rolling rhythm of his stride, and his long tail enable him to trot along the narrowest of branches with ease. Meanwhile, you are left tottering along, your back bent in a curious balancing act, and your eyes averted from the ground, far below.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, you have reached the edge of the rain forest of the Azanam and are overlooking the Azagad Gorge. Far below, you can make out the sharp pinnacles of rock known as the ‘Dragon’s Teeth’ which cover the canyon floor. It was through this gorge that you came in search of the Azanam, and the lost Kundi tribe. There it was that your friend and guide, Shan Li the merchant, died so terribly, devoured by poisonous Quoku, the flying amphibians that inhabit the desolate land. Your silent reverie is interrupted by the sound of Urik calling to you from above. ‘Azagad hold sad memories for Grey Star?’ he enquires sympathetically. You nod your head, not thinking to ask how he knew what was on your mind. ‘No time for sorrow now … time fly! Catch.’ He throws you a length of vine cut from the tree on which he stands. You take up the creeper and look at it in puzzlement. ‘Make yourself a harness and tie it on—good and tight,’ he orders. You do as he suggests and before you can question his purpose, he produces a carved flute. He places it to his lips and begins to play a strange melody quite unlike any music you have ever heard before.</p>
<p>The music lasts for some time. Eventually, Urik puts down his pipe and looks expectantly at the sky. ‘What now?’ you ask, a hint of cynicism in your voice.</p>
<p>‘Look … see!’ he replies. Far away you can see a tiny speck on the skyline. ‘Ooslo bird … love Kundi music.’ The dark speck grows larger and soon you are able to make out the awkward, disproportionate shape of an Ooslo bird. Long-necked and small bodied, the bird’s great wings flap without rhythm or grace. It is a strange creature.</p>

<p>As the bird draws nearer, Urik takes up his pipe once more and plays. Eventually, the bird settles on a nearby branch, craning its neck and twisting its head, an expression of rapt fascination in its big, saucer-like eyes. Urik ties the other end of the vine into a lasso. He stops playing and, with amazing accuracy, throws the lasso over the Ooslo’s head. As the loop of the vine falls and tightens around the bird’s neck, it gives a squawk of alarm. Only now does the nature of Urik’s plan to ‘cover many miles in just one day’ dawn on you.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you are dragged up into the air by the Ooslo bird. Urik gives an excited whoop of delight, leaping into the air and grabbing at your legs, dangling there as the bird flies higher. ‘What do we do now?’ you shout, swinging wildly in the air, the old Kundi man clinging to your legs and grinning maniacally.</p>
<p>‘Ooslo bird fly home now … back to Gurlu Marshes. Ooslo—strong flier. Take us far … and good fun, eh?’ The Ooslo bird squawks loudly and Urik hoots back with a howl of wild laughter.</p>
<p>Despite the discomfort of the vine that chafes under your arms and the dizzying heights of your aerial journey away from the Azanam, you finally admit to yourself that Urik’s dangerous and eccentric plan has saved you many miles of walking and perhaps days of wandering. Far below, the landscape rushes by and by late afternoon the scenery has completely changed. Ahead lie the marshy wastes of the Gurlu swamplands, the nesting place of the Ooslo bird.</p>
<p>The Ooslo bird begins to fly lower, its voluminous wings flapping erratically as it checks its speed. You are wondering how you are to land safely when Urik shouts up to you. He is pointing ahead. ‘Big trouble. Hunters,’ he says. Sure enough, you can see a party of men armed with crossbows. With horror, you recognize the party to be comprised of Shadakine warriors, soldier slaves of the Wytch-king, Shasarak. It is evident that you have been spotted, as the warriors are running this way and that, shouting and busily priming their weapons. The ground speeds by over twenty feet below.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to untie the vine and risk the fall, <a href="sect78.htm">turn to 78</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you prefer to attack the party of hunters with your Wizard’s Staff, <a href="sect188.htm">turn to 188</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Power of Sorcery and prefer to create a magical shield about yourself, <a href="sect278.htm">turn to 278</a>.</p>
