<h3>59</h3>

<p>Now you must run to keep away from their deadly touch. Fortunately, the Deathgaunts are unable to move quickly and you are able to create some distance between them and yourselves, but you are weary from past assaults, and soon find yourself stumbling and staggering through the grey dust of the dead plain. You trip and fall, exhausted, but Samu sweeps you up in his strong arms.</p>
<p>For a full day, Samu carries you but, despite his enormous strength, eventually he, too, becomes too tired to continue. Panting for breath, he sets you down before collapsing to the ground. Hugi estimates that you are now only a day away from the Forbidden City.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go without sleep and continue travelling through the night, <a href="sect129.htm">turn to 129</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Evocation and wish to use it to protect yourself while you sleep, <a href="sect137.htm">turn to 137</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Alchemy and a remaining Azawood leaf, and wish to use it, <a href="sect138.htm">turn to 138</a>.</p>
