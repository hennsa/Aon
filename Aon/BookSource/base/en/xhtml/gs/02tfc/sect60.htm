<h3>60</h3>

<p>Samu enters the grove of trees. Held in a headlock, and gurgling pleas for release, is a scrawny-looking man, dressed in a leather jerkin and bright scarlet breeches. Immediately you recognize him as the thief who tried to steal your money in the cavern of the Freedom Guild. ‘What are you doing here? State your purpose!’ you say, leaping to your feet. The thief lets out a long gurgle by way of reply.</p>

<p>‘What are you doing here?’ you repeat, angrily. Samu tightens his grip on the thief’s neck.</p>
<p>‘Being … strangled!’ he squawks, clawing desperately at the thick arm around his neck.</p>
<p>You give Samu a nod and the brawny giant releases his grip. The thief collapses to the floor in an untidy heap, choking for breath and rubbing his bruised throat. Urik chortles with laughter. ‘Get up!’ you command.</p>
<p>The thief staggers to his feet, an indignant expression on his face as he brushes the dust from his clothes. ‘What have you got to say for yourself, thief?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘I am Hugi of Suhn,’ he says, haughtily.</p>
<p>‘Was it you who tried to rob me in Karnali?’</p>
<p>‘For that oversight I apologize, Master Wizard,’ he says, barely disguising the smirk on his hawkish face. ‘If I had known that you were bound for the Forbidden City, I would have offered my services at once.’</p>
<p>‘How came you by that information?’ you snap angrily.</p>
<p>‘I … er … listened at the door after Sado sent me out,’ he replies innocently.</p>
<p>‘Shall I kill the spy now?’ asks Samu, menacingly.</p>
<p>‘Spy?—Spy?’ Hugi chokes. ‘I am no spy. I am the greatest thief in all Karnali! What need have I for spying?’</p>
<p>‘You not very good at picking Grey Star’s pocket,’ Urik points out.</p>
<p>‘Nevertheless,’ says Hugi, testily. ‘Thief I am. Spy I am not.’</p>
<p>‘That still does not explain why you are following us. Why should the Forbidden City interest you?’</p>
<p>‘Ahhh!’ sighs Hugi, ‘the Forbidden City! Legends speak of priceless statutes—remnants of the ancient people who once lived there. But I have found none who dared go there. When I heard that you were bound for the City of the Dead, I chose to follow. Then, this great brute stepped out of nowhere and tried to strangle me to death.’</p>
<p>Samu glares at Hugi. ‘Shall I kill him now?’ bellows the giant, eagerly. Hugi steps back in alarm.</p>
<p>‘No, wait. Hugi, what do you know of our quest—whom do you serve?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘I know nothing of any quest and I serve no man but myself. All I ask is that you allow me to accompany you to the Forbidden City. I am not unskilled in my own small way,’ he sniffs, immodestly.</p>
<p>‘If he is half as good as he thinks, he could be useful,’ comments Urik.</p>
<p>‘Yes, and if he is a spy, we daren’t let him go, though I’ll not kill a man for the sake of a suspicion. You’re coming with us, Hugi.’ Broadly, the thief begins to smile. ‘And Samu, if he tries to escape … break one of his legs.’ Samu grins ferociously as Hugi’s face drops.</p>
