<h3>66</h3>

<p>Within the darkness of a dream, you hear a voice whispering; it is calling your name, over and over again. Glowing with a sickly light, the figure of a man stands like a sinister vision, his face obscured by shadow. His grey robe is tattered and torn; his long, bony, claw-like fingers are covered by charred, black flesh. He points a crooked finger at you. ‘You will fail. Your power does not suffice. This fool’s errand is to no end.’</p>
<p>‘NO!’ you shout into the emptiness.</p>
<p>‘Turn aside, Grey Star. Turn aside. You dare not stand against me.’ The grim figure casts aside his hood and the shadow passes to a blood-red light, revealing a hideous face. Half of the face is missing and, in its place, a metal plate gives shape to the ruined visage of wasted flesh and scarred tissue. One eye is shrunken and sightless, while the other burns with the intensity of the sun. A gaze of unbearable malice focuses on your heart. ‘Desist, Wizard—or I will rend the very soul from your body.’</p>
<p>‘I will not!’ you scream into the darkness. A look of rage contorts his twisted features and the single eye burns into you. You are looking upon the face of Shasarak, Wytch-king of Shadaki, who has come to taunt and torment you as you sleep.</p>

<p>‘You fear me now, foolish child, and you think that you have mastered fear. I will teach you the true meaning of terror. I will make you yearn for death as if it were your true love!’ Shasarak raises his clawed, decaying hand and clutches his fingers in the air: 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point is drawn effortlessly from your body.</p>
<p>You wake up screaming.</p>
