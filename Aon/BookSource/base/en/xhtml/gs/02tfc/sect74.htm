<h3>74</h3>

<p>You give Urik a nod and then dive into the water, swimming with all your might away from the Shadakine. A flurry of quarrels slices the water around you. Unharmed, you splash to the water’s edge, grateful to be moving into the cover of the tall reeds that line the bank.</p>
<p>Panting for breath, both you and Urik run, half-crouched, through the undergrowth. A desperate chase begins as the Shadakine leave their hiding places and start to run after you. Urik leads the way, running along a shallow waterway that cuts through the tall marsh grass like a path. From behind, the chilling howl of hounds reaches your ears. Urik stops briefly and turns to you. ‘They have hunting dogs, terrible Magdi Hounds. We move slow and quiet now—keep to water—hide scent. I am old Kundi—cannot run,’ he wheezes, the hint of an apology in his voice.</p>
<p>Stealthily, you both creep away with all the speed you can muster.</p>
