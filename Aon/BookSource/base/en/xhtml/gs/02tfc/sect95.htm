<h3>95</h3>

<p>All is silent once more. A third volley of bolts does not appear. Fortunately, the Shadakine are unaware that their attacks are weakening your <i>Shield of Sorcery</i> and have decided that further assaults are useless.</p>
<p>An hour passes. Then, from out of the reeds, a large barrel arcs through the air, a dark liquid spurting from holes drilled into the sides. It splashes into the lake. ‘What are they up to?’ you murmur.</p>
<p>‘Who can say?’ replies Urik. ‘Shadakine have much cunning.’ More barrels are thrown into the lake. Gradually, the thick liquid they contain forms a film on the water, reflecting the light of the setting sun, and soon the entire lake is polluted by the black liquid.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a lighted torch sails through the air and, as it hits the water, ignites the oily surface, transforming the lake into a raging inferno. You are surrounded by flames and soon your clothes begin to smoulder; you wince as the intense heat sears your flesh. Urik fixes you with a panicked stare, primeval fear of fire twisting his features.</p>
