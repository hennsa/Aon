<h2>Footnotes</h2>


<div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-1">1</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) This section of the rules implies that you must re-pick all three scores—<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>—even though you may have already completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books and therefore appears to be a mistake. In order to preserve rule consistency among the books, you may choose to retain your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> scores and only re-pick your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-2">2</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) If you have completed <a href="../../gs/02tfc/title.htm">Book Two</a> but not <a href="../../gs/01gstw/title.htm">Book One</a>, it seems reasonable to add 25 to the number you picked.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-4">3</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) There are sections in the <cite>Grey Star</cite> books that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="../../gs/04wotw/sect175.htm">Section 175</a> of <a href="../../gs/04wotw/title.htm"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, then you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point you lack (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point). If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score.</p>
</div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-3">4</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="powers.htm#powers-1">5</a>]  (<a href="powers.htm">Magical Powers</a>) The wording of this section of the rules seems to indicate—if read literally—that you may choose your set of Powers again if you have completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books. In order to preserve consistency with other books, you should not choose your Powers again. If you have completed at least one previous adventure, you may choose one additional Power from the list. If you choose Alchemy as your new Magical Power, you also receive a Herb Pouch with contents, as detailed in the <a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a> section.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="powers.htm#powers-2">6</a>]  (<a href="powers.htm">Magical Powers</a>) If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-1">7</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) If you have completed a previous adventure, you keep all equipment you had at the end of that adventure. You do not receive any new equipment, unless you have just selected Alchemy as your sixth Magical Power, in which case you receive a Herb Pouch with contents as indicated in this section.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-2">8</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) If you have mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy and therefore have a Herb Pouch, you may choose to keep potions, vials, or ingredients in either the Herb Pouch or your Backpack. All other Backpack Items must be kept in your Backpack.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-3">9</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) The Collector’s Editions of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books clarify that ‘You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.’</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect78.htm#sect78-1">10</a>]  (<a href="sect78.htm">Section 78</a>) As you are using your Power of Elementalism against the Chaos-birds, you should deduct 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect106.htm#sect106-1">11</a>]  (<a href="sect106.htm">Section 106</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect107.htm#sect107-1">12</a>]  (<a href="sect107.htm">Section 107</a>) If the Elessi leader has been holding your Wizard’s Staff until now, you can now take it back.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect118.htm#sect118-1">13</a>]  (<a href="sect118.htm">Section 118</a>) If you have already opened this door, you do not need to do it again. If you have opened the door but chosen <em>not</em> to step through it, you can now choose to do so (turn to <a href="sect125.htm">125</a>), or to walk back to the large stairway (turn to <a href="sect239.htm">239</a>). If you have both opened and ventured inside the door, you must turn to <a href="sect239.htm">239</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect144.htm#sect144-1">14</a>]  (<a href="sect144.htm">Section 144</a>) There is no choice that leads to this section of the book. This appears to be an oversight which is not easily correctable.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect148.htm#sect148-1">15</a>]  (<a href="sect148.htm">Section 148</a>) As you are using your Wizard’s Staff against the Jahksa, you should deduct 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect150.htm#sect150-1">16</a>]  (<a href="sect150.htm">Section 150</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect177.htm#sect177-1">17</a>]  (<a href="sect177.htm">Section 177</a>) You must choose whether to keep the individual buds or to mix potions from them. You may not do both.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect182.htm#sect182-1">18</a>]  (<a href="sect182.htm">Section 182</a>) If the Elessin confiscated your Weapons, including your Wizard’s Staff, these are now returned to you.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect186.htm#sect186-1">19</a>]  (<a href="sect186.htm">Section 186</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect190.htm#sect190-1">20</a>]  (<a href="sect190.htm">Section 190</a>) There is no choice that leads to this section of the book. This appears to be an oversight which is not easily correctable.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect191.htm#sect191-1">21</a>]  (<a href="sect191.htm">Section 191</a>) If you carry any other Weapon in addition to your Wizard’s Staff, the Elessin have confiscated this too (but not any weapon-like Special Items). Note this on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect197.htm#sect197-1">22</a>]  (<a href="sect197.htm">Section 197</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect231.htm#sect231-1">23</a>]  (<a href="sect231.htm">Section 231</a>) Remember that you may only use those Keys you possess.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect240.htm#sect240-1">24</a>]  (<a href="sect240.htm">Section 240</a>) You may keep any Keys that you have already noted on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. You may also keep any Keys that you have not used—which might be the Eagle Key, the Wolf Key, the Spider Key, and/or the Dragon Key. List all Keys to the Crystal Tower as a single Backpack Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (noting which Keys are included). If you do not want to carry the Keys in your Backpack, you can let Tanith carry them, but you must then note down that you cannot access them if Tanith is not with you.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect242.htm#sect242-1">25</a>]  (<a href="sect242.htm">Section 242</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect252.htm#sect252-1">26</a>]  (<a href="sect252.htm">Section 252</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect278.htm#sect278-1">27</a>]  (<a href="sect278.htm">Section 278</a>) If you left your Backpack in the Ethetron, you now regain access to it and all of the items therein.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect287.htm#sect287-1">28</a>]  (<a href="sect287.htm">Section 287</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect305.htm#sect305-1">29</a>]  (<a href="sect305.htm">Section 305</a>) If you choose to keep them, note the Coins and a maximum of one Medallion as Special Items on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. If you choose to keep more than one Medallion, the rest must be carried in your Backpack where they take up one space each.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect344.htm#sect344-1">30</a>]  (<a href="sect344.htm">Section 344</a>) Make a note on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> that you have left your Backpack and all Backpack Items in the Ethetron. You will not have access to them again until you return to the Ethetron.</p></div>
