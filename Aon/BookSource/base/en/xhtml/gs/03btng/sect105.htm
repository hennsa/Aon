<h3>105</h3>

<p>You are led to a high-ceilinged chamber lit by a curious, pulsing light. The room is filled with strange, ornate machines of gleaming metal. Lights flicker and you hear a throbbing hum and a continual, metallic, mechanical ring. Several Academicians tend the machines, pushing buttons and pulling levers, though to what purpose you cannot guess.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star, Tanith—allow me to introduce you to Crabkey, one of our greatest and most ingenious inventors.’</p>

<p>You recognize the shabby man who turns to greet you; he was the man who sat in the armchair when you first entered the chamber of the Academicians. In the strange lurid glow of the laboratory his shadowed, bulging eyes make him appear even more sinister than before. ‘We meet again,’ you say uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Crabkey stares at you without speaking. Spittlethrift breaks the silence: ‘Mr Crabkey is the inventor of the machine that will enable you to journey to the Realm of the Singing City, aren’t you, Crabkey, old chap?’ Crabkey continues to stare at you insolently. With a slow blink of his huge eyes, he makes an unintelligible sound in the back of his throat and nods.</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes,’ says Spittlethrift half to himself. ‘Come now, young Wizard and pretty mistress Tanith, come see his wonderful creation.’ Mounted on a small dais in the centre of the laboratory is a most unusual machine. ‘This,’ says Spittlethrift proudly, ‘is the Ethetron, the flying machine that will carry young Grey Star through the realms of the Daziarn, and to the Singing City to fetch our prize.’</p>
<p>‘Grey Star,’ says Tanith suddenly, ‘and what of me?’</p>
<p>Spittlethrift falters and emits an embarrassed cough, ‘Ah, yes … well … ’</p>
<p>‘Yes, what of Tanith?’ you demand angrily.</p>
<p>‘The girl stays here,’ says Crabkey, speaking for the first time in a harsh, rasping voice, ‘to make sure you keep your part of the bargain and do not fail to return.’</p>
<p>‘She will be perfectly safe, I assure you,’ says Spittlethrift, apologetically. ‘But surely you understand our position. What is to stop you flying away and never returning?’</p>
<p>‘And if I refuse?’ you snap at Spittlethrift.</p>
<p>‘We will not allow you to use the Ethetron or show you how to fly it,’ retorts Crabkey. ‘You will be doomed to remain within the Neverness for all eternity. You will—’</p>
<p>‘You will, on the other hand,’ Spittlethrift interjects hastily, ‘receive the Ethetron as a gift from us when you return—’</p>
<p>‘With the Threnogem,’ Crabkey interrupts once more, ignoring a glare of warning from Spittlethrift, who has now begun to sweat profusely. ‘And we will return Mistress Tanith to you, of course,’ he finishes. Tanith clenches her fists and glares furiously at the two little men. Both step back a little from her fiery gaze. ‘Know this, little man,’ she hisses, prodding Spittlethrift in the chest with one, long-nailed finger. ‘I am not without power. If you seek to deceive us … I’ll crush you like the toad that you are! I am a Shadakine Wytch, not a mere girl to be hoarded or bartered like a piece of spare luggage!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes, of course,’ says Spittlethrift, wiping his brow with the back of his shaking hand. ‘I understand.’</p>
<p>You smile quietly to yourself. Tanith’s angry bluff has shaken both Spittlethrift and Crabkey. Though Tanith does possess many uncanny powers taught to her while in the service of Mother Magri, a powerful Wytch in the service of the Shadakine Empire, her skills lie chiefly in her mastery of animals and nature and in a bravery that surpasses many warriors of greater stature. Tanith turns to you, the fire dying in her wild, green eyes. ‘Accept their offer, Grey Star,’ she says. ‘I do not fear this over-fed worm, or that slinking weasel.’</p>
<p>You sense that Tanith is far more afraid than she admits but the success of the quest is as important to her as it is to you and without the Ethetron it is unlikely that you will succeed. ‘Very well,’ you say. ‘Show me how the machine works. What must I do?’</p>
<p>Sullenly, Crabkey shows you the machine. Spittlethrift, pale and perspiring, remains silent, his chubby hands fluttering nervously at his side.</p>
