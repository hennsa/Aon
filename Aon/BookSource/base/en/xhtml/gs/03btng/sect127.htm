<h3>127</h3>

<p>You peer into the gloom of the wooden hut. Two figures are sitting in the centre of the room: a gaunt-faced man in rags and Tanith. Your heart leaps with joy. ‘At last!’ you cry. ‘I’ve found you!’ Tanith and the gaunt-faced man turn and look at you with grief-stricken faces. They edge back to a corner of the room as you approach.</p>
<p>‘Get back!’ Tanith screams. ‘Go away; leave me alone.’</p>
<p>‘But … Tanith … ’ you falter, ‘it’s me, Grey Star, your friend.’</p>
<p>‘You’re no friend of mine, evil one!’ she spits. ‘You serve Shasarak now. You told me that yourself in the Crystal Tower.’ She and the man huddle together, cowering in fear. ‘Get out! Get out!’ she screams hysterically, throwing a cup at your head.</p>
<p>She believes that the Black Wizard, who bears your likeness, is truly you and that you have fallen into the service of evil. No matter how hard you try to explain, she will not understand. You feel sure that her fear is unnatural; for even if she does believe you have turned to evil, you have never before known her to exhibit such fear. She must have been placed under a powerful spell.</p>

<p class="choice">If you possess a Mind Gem and wish to use it, <a href="sect219.htm">turn to 219</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Prophecy and wish to use it, <a href="sect207.htm">turn to 207</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Enchantment and wish to try to rid Tanith of the enchantment which holds her, <a href="sect213.htm">turn to 213</a>.</p>
