<h3>169</h3>

<p>You close your eyes and begin to chant. The Vale villagers flinch visibly, convinced that you mean to hurt them. You carry on regardless. At the cost of 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point you cause it to rain. The fire is raging quite heavily and you are doubtful that the shower you have raised is of sufficient intensity to quench the fire. You prepare to throw another <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point into the spell but stop suddenly as the villagers give a great gasp. A cold evil throbs at your back.</p>
<p>You spin round to face the Jahksa. ‘Why do you waste your energies so?’ the Jahksa enquires. ‘On these simpletons and peasants.’</p>
<p>‘And why have you shown yourself?’ you ask. ‘These people now know that I did not burn their village. Surely you hoped that they would cast me out without telling me where the Gate to the next realm can be found?’</p>
<p>‘Your unimpressive display of weather-working has sufficed,’ he snorts, derisively. ‘You have saved the people and all live happily ever after,’ he sneers, sarcastically. ‘But other dangers await <em>you</em>.’ So saying, the Jahksa disappears.</p>
