<h3>213</h3>

<p>Believing that Tanith is held by means of enchantment, you decide to fight like with like. Tanith and the gaunt man are still cowering in the corner of the room. Patiently you sit down on a wooden chair opposite and begin the trance. You know that you cannot dispel Tanith’s illusion; you must enable her to do that herself if she is to be free.</p>
<p>When you have shaped the illusion in your mind you transfer it to hers. You begin to recall, moment by moment, all the events that you and she have shared. You start from the time when you first met in the dungeons of Mother Magri and she, a serving girl in the Wytch’s service, offered you food and pity. You go on to describe her role in your escape. Still her illusion is not broken. Tanith’s breathing becomes more rapid and sweat breaks out upon her brow. Her face is torn by conflicting emotions as you strain to maintain your illusion: lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to expend a further <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point to continue your spell, <a href="sect253.htm">turn to 253</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to give up, <a href="sect265.htm">turn to 265</a>.</p>
