<h3>238</h3>

<p>You are now the centre of attention. Your clothes and appearance distinguish you considerably from the Elessin and soon a great crowd surrounds you. Their faces are warm and welcoming and you sense no danger. The press of the crowd carries you down the long avenue and ahead you see a huge palace, more beautiful than the other buildings. You head towards it, the Elessin laughing and singing around you.</p>
<p>Eventually, you reach the bottom of a massive glass stairway that leads into the palace itself. Before the entrance at the top of the staircase stands an imposing figure draped in white and golden robes. You climb the steps, leaving the Elessin at the bottom. The man greets you; he has long, golden hair and sparkling blue eyes and holds a jewelled crozier in his hand. He is the leader of the Elessin. With a welcoming gesture, the man ushers you into the palace. Any plan for the secret theft of the Threnogem is shattered and you decide to allow events to run their natural course in the hope that an opportunity will soon present itself. With diplomacy in mind, you bow and follow the golden-haired man into the magnificent palace.</p>
