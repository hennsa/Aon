<h3>242</h3>

<p>‘Wait, dragon,’ you call, as the mighty beast makes to leave. ‘What do you know of these Keys? Which one will open the Crystal Tower? What lies beyond?’</p>
<p>The dragon peers down at you, a wisp of smoke curling from its nostrils and winding around its long, reptilian head. ‘Little Wizard,’ he says in a deep, rumbling voice, ‘thy friend hath mastered a dragon. What more couldst thou seek to achieve?’ You say nothing, and with a weary tone, the dragon continues. ‘Each Key can summon the beast in whose likeness it hath been fashioned. These are not true beasts but spirit creatures. He who can master beasts may master these creatures also, otherwise he will be slain by them.’</p>
<p>‘Which Key opens the door to the Crystal Tower?’ you ask.</p>
<p>‘Of this, I cannot speak, save to tell that the answer lies hidden in the words above the door,’ the dragon answers reluctantly. With these words, the dragon lifts its broad wings and soars into the sky, swiftly disappearing from view.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep the Dragon Key, mark it as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>You turn and read the inscription once more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
         ‘Ware the hunters, beasts of prey,<br />
         Five in number, feared by name:<br />
         The widow woman, patient weaver;<br />
         The tireless runner, shadow-seeker;<br />
         Bird of fire, the treasure lover;<br />
         Arrow-swift, his keen-eyed brother;<br />
         But only he who walks without feet<br />
         May pass this door of mystery.’<br />
        </p>

</blockquote>
<p>You must now choose from the remaining Keys.<sup><a href="#sect242-1-foot" name="sect242-1">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you choose the Spider Key, <a href="sect252.htm">turn to 252</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose the Wolf Key, <a href="sect235.htm">turn to 235</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose the Eagle Key, <a href="sect227.htm">turn to 227</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose the Serpent Key, <a href="sect240.htm">turn to 240</a>.</p>
