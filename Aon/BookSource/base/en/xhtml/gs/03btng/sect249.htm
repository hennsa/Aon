<h3>249</h3>

<p>The Chaos-master has placed you in an impossible situation, as was his intention. You are being forced to take your enemy with you on your quest, the success of which he seeks to prevent.</p>
<p>You and Tanith walk back to the Ethetron, the Jahksa close behind. With a smirk, he, too, squeezes into the little craft. As you rise into the air and steer towards the Moaning Mountain, you rack your brains for a way of ridding yourself of your enemy, standing at the far end of the craft and grinning maliciously at you.</p>
<p>There is little you can do, for your attention is devoted to operating the controls that keep the Ethetron in flight. Your nerves are constantly on edge; the Jahksa is in an ideal position to bring the craft down in the writhing sea below and you are plagued by the thought that the Jahksa can predict your every move.</p>
<p>A large bank of storm clouds ahead spells trouble. The Jahksa has been silent for a long time and you wonder if he has summoned an Elemental storm against you.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Prophecy and wish to use it, <a href="sect24.htm">turn to 24</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Elementalism and wish to use it, <a href="sect27.htm">turn to 27</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the Jahksa, <a href="sect148.htm">turn to 148</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to use your Magical Powers at this time, or if you do not possess either of the above, <a href="sect165.htm">turn to 165</a>.</p>
