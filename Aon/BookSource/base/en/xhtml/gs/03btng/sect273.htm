<h3>273</h3>

<p>The Jahksa has chosen to leave this realm and his body is dematerializing before your eyes. ‘Thanks for the entertainment, Wizardling … ’ he sneers as he disappears, and you hear his fading voice. ‘We shall meet again.’</p>
<p>‘I shall look forward to that,’ you say, through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>‘Come, Grey Star,’ says Tanith. ‘We must speak with Oz-na-Mun if we are to find our way out of this place.’</p>
<p>You find Oz-na-Mun in his shack. The gaunt-faced man looks up at you with solemn eyes. ‘The evil one—has he gone?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ says Tanith. ‘He will not return.’</p>
<p>‘Good. You have my sympathy, Grey Star. It must be a terrible trial to have a foe such as he.’</p>
<p>‘It is Shasarak who is the foe,’ you say, ‘and he is cunning. For surely there is something that each of us fears in ourselves. What better opponent than a creature that wears my shape, knows my thoughts, and can anticipate my moves?’</p>
<p>‘I hear that you seek the Moonstone,’ says Oz-na-Mun. You nod your reply. ‘I have prepared a map for you. It will guide you to the Gate by which you can leave this realm. There is a mountain that lies nearby. It is called the Moaning Mountain because of the sound of the wind that blows through it. In the side of the mountain is a cavern: the Gate is there. The Gate leads to a place that people call the Vale of Peace. The people of the Vale are wise and kind and they will show you the way to the hidden realm of the Moonstone.’ He hands you the Cloth Map. (Mark this as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>; it can be carried in a small pocket inside your robe.)</p>
<p>You bid farewell to Oz-na-Mun and return to the Ethetron. Soon you are heading for the Moaning Mountain and the Gate that will carry you from the Realm of Paradox to the Vale of Peace.</p>
