<h3>276</h3>

<p>With one final effort you throw a further <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point into your attempt to reach Tanith. The effort is strenuous and also costs you 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point. Your illusion is almost over and you begin to fear that you will fail but, as you reach your reunion with Tanith at the Shadow Gate, a glimmer of recognition lights in her eyes. ‘Is it true?’ she whispers. ‘Is it really true?’ Unsteadily, she climbs to her feet and walks towards you with slow, faltering steps. She stands before you and you sense that you have broken through the barrier that covered her mind. You reach out and draw her near to you.</p>
<p>‘It’s me,’ you whisper.</p>
<p>‘Grey Star,’ she sobs. ‘I thought … it was in my mind … the Black Wizard, he had your face. He took me from the Crystal Tower and brought me here. The Chaos-master asked me what gift I desired and I asked for you, Grey Star. Then the Chaos-master told me that the Black Wizard was you and then my mind was full of hate and loathing. I … ’</p>
<p>‘You don’t have to explain; it’s all right, I understand,’ you say. From outside the shack, a sneering voice sends an unnatural chill through your body.</p>
<p>‘How touching; how nice. Such understanding.’ The evil voice laughs, mockingly. You run outside to see a hooded figure in a black robe carrying a black staff. Slowly, deliberately, the hood is pulled aside to reveal your own face; your own eyes stare back at you as if you were looking into a mirror. ‘Greetings, brother,’ says your voice, with a bitter laugh. ‘We meet at last.’</p>
