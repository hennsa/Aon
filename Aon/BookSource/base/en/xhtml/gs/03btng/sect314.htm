<h3>314</h3>

<p>You grab Spittlethrift by the shoulders. ‘The Realm of Paradox,’ you say, shaking him roughly; ‘how do I get there?’ You shake the little man again.</p>
<p>Dazed, he replies: ‘We will adjust the Gyronome. It will take a little time.’</p>
<p>‘I have no time. Perhaps the impostor has slain her already.’</p>
<p>‘We will hurry,’ replies Spittlethrift, who scuttles off to see about the task.</p>
<p>Time drags on inexorably. You pace the room until, eventually, Spittlethrift and Slypate return with the adjusted Gyronome and follow you to the Ethetron. Hastily, you drag the statue of the Screaming God from the craft and dump it at the tower door. Then you take to the air once more.</p>
<p>Just as the tingling sensation that heralds the crossing of the realms begins, you hear a terrible sound in the distance. It is a moaning wail that chills your heart. Looking back, you see that the Crystal Tower is falling. Suddenly, you realize that you did not warn the Academicians of the peril of the Screaming God. One of them must have removed the Threnogem from the mouth of the statue. You can do nothing for them now. As you look away, your eyes are greeted by a strange sight: the Realm of Paradox.</p>
