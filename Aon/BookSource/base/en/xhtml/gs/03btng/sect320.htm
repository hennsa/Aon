<h3>320</h3>

<p>You watch as the Elessin head back towards their city. When they are a sufficient distance away, you follow, keeping out of sight. Their path leads you to the gate of the city and, crouching behind a bush, you watch as they enter.</p>
<p>The city is a dazzling display of glass and crystal. Delicate spires and ivory towers point to the sky. You listen to the music of the city: a faint ringing like a million tiny bells and a warm, resonant bass accompanied by pure harmonies that sigh like a spring breeze. The Academicians told you that the Elessin are cruel creatures, but their dwelling suggests purity and an advanced civilization. Beneath the curving crystal arch of the city gate, an Elessi stands. He has no weapons, but he marches before the gate as if he were a guard.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter the city through this gate, <a href="sect274.htm">turn to 274</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to try to find another way into the city, <a href="sect280.htm">turn to 280</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Mind Gem and wish to use it, <a href="sect301.htm">turn to 301</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magical Power of Enchantment and wish to try to pass the guard undetected, <a href="sect294.htm">turn to 294</a>.</p>
