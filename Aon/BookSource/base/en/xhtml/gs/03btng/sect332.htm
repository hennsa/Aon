<h3>332</h3>

<p>Quickly, you hide the bodies of the Elessin in the undergrowth within the grove of trees. It is likely that the Elessin who escaped will raise the alarm and you carefully consider your next course of action: should you enter the Singing City as you are or should you adopt a disguise? To disguise yourself as an Elessi means leaving your Backpack behind. However, you must attempt to enter the city before evidence of your crime is discovered and that means that you cannot wait for nightfall to try to sneak into the city.</p>
<p>Whatever decision you make, you now face great danger. You are an intruder in an unknown city, unfamiliar with the language or customs of its people and intent on stealing their most precious artefact.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to disguise yourself as an Elessi, <a href="sect344.htm">turn to 344</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to attempt to enter the city as you are, <a href="sect315.htm">turn to 315</a>.</p>
