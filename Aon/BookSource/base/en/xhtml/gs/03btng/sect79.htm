<h3>79</h3>

<p>The music of the Singing City has changed, and is now a rhythmic accompaniment to the sound of many voices, singing and chanting. You follow the sound and come to a long avenue, paved with crystal stones. At the end of the avenue stands a gigantic palace, and at the foot of its grand staircase, are amassed a large crowd of Elessin, all singing in perfect unison. Standing before them is a man, robed in white and gold, with golden hair and blue eyes. In his left hand he holds a jewelled crozier. He seems to be conducting a religious ceremony or ritual. You guess that the Threnogem lies within the palace.</p>
<p>Transfixed by the beauty of the Elessin’s music, you wait for the ceremony to end, and at length, the crowd disperses and the man with the golden hair returns into the palace.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to mount the steps and enter the palace, <a href="sect208.htm">turn to 208</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to wait for nightfall, that you might investigate the palace in secret, <a href="sect121.htm">turn to 121</a>.</p>
