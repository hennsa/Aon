<h2>The Story So Far … </h2>

<p>You are Grey Star, trained in the ancient lore of a Shianti Wizard. For sixteen years you have dwelt in safety on the Isle of Lorn, the hidden realm of the magical Shianti race, until Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, decides to send you upon a dangerous quest: to save your own people, the race of man, from the tyrannical Wytch-king of Shadaki, Shasarak. Held by their ancient vow to the goddess Ishir, the Shianti are unable to leave their island either to come to the direct aid of man or to retrieve the Moonstone, which possesses the combined forces of all Shianti powers and lies hidden on another plane. As a human, no vow prohibits you from leaving the island and you have been sent to recover the Moonstone and commanded to use its power to defeat the Wytch-king. The Moonstone is hidden on the Daziarn Plane, which can be entered only by finding one of its portals.</p>
<p>Your quest begins with the search for the Shadow Gate, a doorway to the Daziarn that never remains in one place for longer than a day and is invisible to the human eye. To help you find the Shadow Gate you first seek the Lost Tribe of Lara, a race of magical but primitive creatures called the Kundi, who possess the gift of astral vision, enabling them to see the gateways to other worlds and dimensions.</p>
<p>On first arriving at the Port of Suhn, the major trading port of the Shadakine Empire, you are befriended by Shan Li, a merchant who serves as your guide through these strange and foreign lands. A short while after, you are captured and imprisoned in the House of Correction, the prison of Suhn and citadel of Mother Magri, a Wytch in the service of Shasarak. Tanith, a young girl learning the ways of wytchcraft comes to your rescue. She helps you escape from the dungeons of Mother Magri and later sacrifices herself, calling the shadow demon, the Kleasá, against her to save you from its attack.</p>
<p>After many more adventures you come, at last, to the Azanam, the treetop home of the Kundi. They give you Urik the Wise, an old Kundi Shaman, to guide you to the Shadow Gate. The two of you cross the dangerous lands of the Shadakine Empire, pursuing Urik’s vision which leads you, finally, to the Forbidden City of Gyanima in the Mountains of Morn. Beyond is Desolation Valley and there you find the Shadow Gate. However, it is guarded by one of Shasarak’s many slaves, a demon Kleasá; in fact the very Kleasá that captured Tanith, who stands in the Gateway, eternal prisoner of Shasarak unless you can free her. Finally you discover a way of releasing the Kleasá and opening the Gate.</p>
<p>Bidding farewell to Urik, you prepare to enter the Gate.</p>
