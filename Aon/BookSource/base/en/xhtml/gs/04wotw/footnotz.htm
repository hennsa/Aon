<h2>Footnotes</h2>


<div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-1">1</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) It is implied that you must pick a new <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> even if have already completed previous one or more <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventures. This conflicts with the rules for the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books where you carry over your score from a previous successfully completed adventure. For the sake of consistency, players may wish to carry over their existing score from the last <cite>Grey Star</cite> book they completed.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-2">2</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) The original intent of the author was most likely that the player should add 50 to their final <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score from the end of their last successfully completed <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-5">3</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p><p>Alternatively, you may wish to use a method given in <a href="sect175.htm">Section 175</a>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, then you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point you lack (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point). If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
<p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard’s Staff if you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score.</p>
</div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-3">4</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="gamerulz.htm#gamerulz-4">5</a>]  (<a href="gamerulz.htm">The Game Rules</a>) The original intent of the author was most likely that the player should add 30 to their final <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score from the end of their last successfully completed <cite>Grey Star</cite> adventure. In the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, it is standard practice to restore one’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to their original total when carrying them over from one adventure to the next, but the power of the Moonstone seems to change those rules in this case.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="powers.htm#powers-1">6</a>]  (<a href="powers.htm">Magical Powers</a>) The wording of this section of the rules seems to indicate—if read literally—that you may choose your set of Lesser Magicks again if you have completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books. In order to preserve consistency with other books, you should not choose your Lesser Magicks again. If you have currently mastered five Lesser Magicks, you may choose one additional Lesser Magick from the list. If you have already mastered six Lesser Magicks, you keep these. If you choose Alchemy as a new Lesser Magick, or you have not mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy but you have selected the Higher Magick of Theurgy, you also receive a Herb Pouch with contents, as detailed in the Equipment section.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="powers.htm#powers-2">7</a>]  (<a href="powers.htm">Magical Powers</a>) If your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to use the magical properties of your Wizard’s Staff until your score is again above zero. You can still use your Wizard’s Staff in combat as a normal weapon, but you must deduct 6 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-1">8</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) If you have completed a previous adventure, you keep all equipment you had at the end of that adventure. You do not receive any new equipment, unless you have just selected Alchemy as your sixth Lesser Magick, or if you have not mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy but you have selected the Higher Magick of Theurgy, in which case you receive a Herb Pouch with contents as indicated in this section.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-2">9</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) If you have mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy or the Higher Magick of Theurgy and therefore have a Herb Pouch, you may choose to keep potions, vials, or ingredients in either the Herb Pouch or your Backpack. All other Backpack Items must be kept in your Backpack.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-3">10</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) The Collector’s Editions of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books clarify that ‘You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.’</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect25.htm#sect25-1">11</a>]  (<a href="sect25.htm">Section 25</a>) If you wish to take the Sheath, record it as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect25.htm#sect25-2">12</a>]  (<a href="sect25.htm">Section 25</a>) If you wish to take the Sheath, record it as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect47.htm#sect47-1">13</a>]  (<a href="sect47.htm">Section 47</a>) Although the term ‘Agarashi’ is not used anywhere else in the <cite>Grey Star</cite> books, it is used in other books as the collective term for the monstrous servants of Agarash the Damned.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect104.htm#sect104-1">14</a>]  (<a href="sect104.htm">Section 104</a>) If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative. Alternatively, you may choose the method used in <a href="sect175.htm">Section 175</a> for resolving this problem: For the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you lack, you use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point).</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect112.htm#sect112-1">15</a>]  (<a href="sect112.htm">Section 112</a>) If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose the method used in <a href="sect175.htm">Section 175</a> for resolving this problem: For the <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points you lack, you must use <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points at a rate of 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point (i.e. 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points = 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point).</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect139.htm#sect139-1">16</a>]  (<a href="sect139.htm">Section 139</a>) If you do not have sufficient <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. This may leave you with a negative <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.

If you are versed in the Higher Magick of Thaumaturgy you can teleport by deducting 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points from your total. To use the Dimension Door of the Moonstone to teleport, deduct 4 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points (cf. <a href="sect12.htm">Section 12</a>).</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect331.htm#sect331-1">20</a>]  (<a href="sect331.htm">Section 331</a>) Tarama Seeds may be recorded as Special Items since they don’t take up space in your Herb Pouch or Backpack. Each Tarama Seed can be used to cast exactly one spell or to use your Wizard’s Staff outside of close combat (e.g. to fire a bolt of energy at a distant enemy) without using the normally required <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. Tarama Seeds cannot be used to maintain the effect of a spell or in place of other drains on your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span>, like mental attacks. It also seems inappropriate to use a Tarama Seed in close combat where you could then decide to expend an infinite amount of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> to automatically win a fight.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect336.htm#sect336-1">21</a>]  (<a href="sect336.htm">Section 336</a>) Tarama Seeds may be recorded as Special Items since they don’t take up space in your Herb Pouch or Backpack.
