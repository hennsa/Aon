<h2>Sage Advice</h2>

<p>Now begins the last and most dangerous stage of your quest to vanquish the Wytch-king, Shasarak. Beware, for you must face many dangers before you are able to confront him at last.</p>
<p>You will find items that might be of assistance on your quest. Some Special Items will help you, others may be of no use at all. You must decide what to keep.</p>
<p>Special care must be taken when selecting your Magical Powers. Make sure that your combination of Higher and Lesser Magicks covers every eventuality. Also, it is worth remembering that some of these Magical Powers will be of little use to you during this part of your quest: choose the Powers you think you are most likely to require at this stage.</p>
<p>Be cautious in your use of <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, as your <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> is the energy source for both your Magical Powers and your Wizard’s Staff. If you have a low <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> score when you confront Shasarak, you may be easily defeated.</p>
<p>Follow the path of wisdom, Wizard Grey Star. The way of fools is the road to destruction!</p>
