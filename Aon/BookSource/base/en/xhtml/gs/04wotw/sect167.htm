<h3>167</h3>

<p>Using 2 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, you shake off the power that held you and push it from your mind.</p>
<p>‘You cannot resist, Shianti slave,’ the voice spits. ‘You know not who you defy. Know you that I am Agarash the Damned, Demonlord of Darkness. You cannot stand against me. Come, come to me. Take my place here in the Pit of Eternal Pain and I shall be freed.’</p>
<p>You feel the force of Agarash’s will once again. It is a strength mightier than any you have ever known. You fight with a Demonlord, a servant of Naar, King of the Darkness, a force of ultimate evil. Legend tells that Agarash was once a ruler in the world of Magnamund, till he was defeated by a magical race called the Elder Magi and banished to another plane, doomed to remain there for all eternity. Agarash seeks to draw you towards the portal of fire that is the doorway to his prison.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to duel with the will of Agarash and have 5 or more <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, <a href="sect192.htm">turn to 192</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to close the portal of fire using the Moonstone and have 5 or more <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, <a href="sect209.htm">turn to 209</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not have 5 or more <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points, <a href="sect176.htm">turn to 176</a>.</p>
