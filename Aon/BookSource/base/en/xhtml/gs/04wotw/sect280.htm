<h3>280</h3>

<p>Hurriedly you pull off the helmet and stand flinching beneath Samu’s poised sword. But he is an expert warrior and he checks its downward sweep in an instant. His eyes bulge in amazement. ‘Grey Star!’ he gasps. ‘I almost killed you!’</p>
<p>‘No time … no time,’ you reply, quickly, shaking Samu from his stupor. ‘Call your men; we must retreat. See?’ you say, gesturing across the river. ‘I have brought the demon plague. We must flee while they and the Shadakine fight.’</p>
<p>It is as you say. Across the river the demons wage a ferocious battle against the Shadakine. Instantly Samu springs into action, calling to his men and ordering a trumpeter to sound a retreat. The Masbaté retire. The Shadakine are too involved in their fight to pursue, at least for the moment, but you know that it is essential to destroy the bridge to prevent any pursuit should the Shadakine, who must number in their thousands, quickly defeat the demon plague.</p>
