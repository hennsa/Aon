<h3>29</h3>

<p>‘You will need to be able to move fast to escape the demon horde,’ says Samu. ‘Long ago, we of the Masbaté bred a strain of horse called the Simar, renowned for its stamina and the ease with which it can be controlled. It will not shy away from danger.’</p>
<p>A great white stallion is brought before you, harnessed and saddled. Gratefully, you thank Samu for his gift. The Masbaté are summoned and stand fitted and accoutred for battle before their king in a rocky escarpment shaped like a vast amphitheatre. They number a thousand men: a small number perhaps, but a mighty army nevertheless, for the Masbaté are formidable warriors. In a rousing speech, Samu tells them of the battle to come at the bridge at Lanzi, where you will rid their homeland of the demon plague forever. You receive a great cheer before Samu leads his people out of the mountains, towards Lanzi. A guide leads you to the other side of the mountains. The Shadakine Army is expected to reach the bridge at Lanzi within a day. In that time you must close the demon portal in the hills south of Tilos and lead the demons through the forested pass and against the Shadakine Army.</p>
<p>At last you come to the edge of the Lissan Plain and your guide prepares to leave. Before he goes, he offers you the following items to help you in your adventure. You may keep any or all of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Backpack</li>
<li>Coil of Rope (Backpack Item)</li>
<li>Water Bottle (Special Item—slung over the shoulder by a leather strap)</li>
<li>Tinderbox (Backpack Item)</li>
<li>Sword (Weapon)</li>
<li>Masbaté Battle Horn (Special Item—hung over the shoulder by a strap)</li>
</ul>
<p>The guide returns to the mountains. You are alone. You urge the Simar horse into a trot and head north.</p>
