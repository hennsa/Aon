<h3>300</h3>

<p>The entire day passes without any sign of the Shadakine. The army are well ensconced in defensive positions around the edges of the forest. Your sleep that night proves extremely restful, restoring 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> and 3 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> points. The following day there is still no sign of the Shadakine Army. A tense, uneasy silence descends on the men: they are anxious to fight. That night you are awakened by the crooning call of voices that beckon you.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, you rise and follow the sound deep into the forest. As you walk among the impenetrable shadows, you hear, mingled with the calls, the mournful creak of trees, whose branches have been stirred by a newly-risen wind. You become aware of a sickly yellow glow deeper in the wood. You walk towards it, treading a path that leads up a steep hill of craggy, moss-covered stone. At the top of the hill are seven hulking shapes, tall as trees, wreathed in yellow light. The light reminds you of the yellow light of the Kazim Stones, instruments of truth and torture, power and possession, belonging to the Shadakine Wytches. A wave of panic grows inside you. The crooning is emanating from the tall forms within the halos of light, only now the words of the song are distinct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
         We are the Kazim, masters of truth,<br />
         Wielders of power, steadfast in sooth,<br />
         Lost are our stone hearts to the evil of the night,<br />
         Clutched by the dark one, stealer of light,<br />
         We wait for the Grey One, foe of the dark,<br />
         Heralding battle, to regain our hearts.<br />
        </p>

</blockquote>
