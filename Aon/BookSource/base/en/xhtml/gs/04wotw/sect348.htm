<h3>348</h3>

<p>‘We are only able to send you to the Lissan Plain, the northwestern province of the Shadakine Empire (see the <a href="map.htm">map</a>). This was once the domain of the Masbaté tribe, warrior nomads of great prowess and strength. It was Shasarak who brought doom to this once-great people, when the Shadakine Empire was first won. In a terrible war, hordes of Shadakine warriors pursued the Masbaté across the plains in their great war chariots, led by the Wytch-king himself. The Masbaté were able to resist the Shadakine, despite overwhelming odds, until Shasarak summoned the demon plague. Faced with such an assault, the Masbaté were unable to resist and an entire race was wiped from the face of the world. The demons still roam the plains, and no one dares go there. The vast expanse of the Lissan Plain was once rich and fertile. Now, none may benefit from it, save for the scavenging packs of hell beasts that roam there.’</p>
<p>His voice has begun to grow very faint.</p>
