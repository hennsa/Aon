<h3>353</h3>

<p>In a stunning display of battle skills, you hack a path of blazing, magical fire through the Shadakine ranks. On the bridge you can hear the cheering of the Masbaté as you wreak terrible havoc among your foes. They urge you on, their cries growing louder as you draw nearer. Suddenly your horse is cut from under you and you throw yourself clear and onto the stone bridge to run the last steps towards the Masbaté. They rush forward to protect your flanks. You are safe. Samu rushes to meet you. ‘Grey Star, that was magnificent … ’ he begins.</p>
<p>‘No time … no time,’ you pant. ‘Sound the retreat. We must flee. See? I have brought the demon plague.’</p>
<p>It is as you say. Even now, across the river, you can see a wild, screaming mass as the demon horde battles with the Shadakine. Samu nods and springs into action. He sounds a battle horn and the Masbaté retire. The Shadakine cannot pursue while the demon host fights at their back. However, you must destroy the bridge to prevent pursuit should the Shadakine, whose entire army numbers in thousands defeat the demon plague too soon.</p>
