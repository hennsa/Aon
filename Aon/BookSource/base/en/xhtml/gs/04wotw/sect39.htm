<h3>39</h3>

<p>Suddenly you are in a wide, round hall, full of shadows. At one end of the hall is a flaming wall, and kneeling before the wall is the hunched figure of Shasarak, Wytch-king of Shadaki. His back is turned to you but he spins round the instant you arrive. He is a hideous sight. His flesh is black as if burnt by recent fires and his fingers are like claws. Half his face is missing, and in its place there is a metal plate, which is the only thing that gives shape to a livid mass of shrunken flesh and tissue. One eye is shrivelled, sightless, and shrunken, the other burns into you with hatred so intense that it almost forces you back a step.</p>

<p>The room fills with the sound of savage laughter, but it is not Shasarak who laughs. A familiar, slithering, deathly voice emanates from the wall of fire, and within the fire you see two slanted eyes: pools of absolute darkness. It is the Demonlord Agarash!</p>
<p>‘See, Shasarak. He has come, as I told you he would. He has come to slay you. Won’t you accept my bargain?’</p>
<p><em>‘Never!’</em> Shasarak hisses, his voice like the rush of broken stone scattering on the floor. ‘He does not have the power to master me … as you have not, Demon.’</p>
<p>Shasarak glares at you malevolently and raises a damaged hand. He is about to strike.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have 1 <span class="smallcaps">WILLPOWER</span> point and wish to raise the Moonstone against Shasarak, <a href="sect21.htm">turn to 21</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to defend yourself with the Moonstone, <a href="sect92.htm">turn to 92</a>.</p>
