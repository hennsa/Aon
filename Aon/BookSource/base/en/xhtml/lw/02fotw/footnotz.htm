<h2>Footnotes</h2>


<div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect31.htm#sect31-1">1</a>]  (<a href="sect31.htm">Section 31</a>) If you do not have a Backpack, you may choose to assume here that you are outfitted with one by Rhygar.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect47.htm#sect47-1">2</a>]  (<a href="sect47.htm">Section 47</a>) You must have learned the password (i.e. have read <a href="sect15.htm">Section 15</a>) during this same adventure (not only during a previous reading) in order to use it.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect79.htm#sect79-1">3</a>]  (<a href="sect79.htm">Section 79</a>) The Sommerswerd is a weapon-like Special Item. The +10 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> bonus referred to for Weaponskill is a combination of the +8 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> that the Sommerswerd grants naturally and +2 for Weaponskill with Short Sword, Sword, or Broadsword (as each of them grant proficiency with the Sommerswerd). It is not an additional bonus. When used in combat, treat it like a one-handed sword, regardless of Weaponskill bonus. The text or footnotes will always remind you to double your enemy’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point loss if it is undead.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect103.htm#sect103-1">4</a>]  (<a href="sect103.htm">Section 103</a>) This Meal of Laumspur may be consumed when instructed to eat a Meal in which case it fulfils the Meal requirement in addition to restoring 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Laumspur may also be consumed at any other time to restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points without having any significance as a Meal.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect113.htm#sect113-1">5</a>]  (<a href="sect113.htm">Section 113</a>) It is likely that the information provided here is a combination of the information given to you previously by Banedon and the Kai Discipline of Sixth Sense, both of which you must have in order to receive the Crystal Star Pendant.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect116.htm#sect116-1">6</a>]  (<a href="sect116.htm">Section 116</a>) Neither Discipline literally gives you the ability to see through clay.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect181.htm#sect181-1">7</a>]  (<a href="sect181.htm">Section 181</a>) According to <cite>Lone Wolf Club Newsletter #12</cite>: ‘Realistically, you can only wear one Backpack at a time, and carry a maximum of eight Backpack Items (Special Items not included).’</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect194.htm#sect194-1">8</a>]  (<a href="sect194.htm">Section 194</a>) In the Collector’s Edition, you do not lose any of your Special Items except for the Seal of Hammerdal. You may choose to follow these instructions instead.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect242.htm#sect242-1">9</a>]  (<a href="sect242.htm">Section 242</a>) The Sommerswerd is a weapon-like Special Item. The +10 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> bonus referred to for Weaponskill is a combination of the +8 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> that the Sommerswerd grants naturally and +2 for Weaponskill with Short Sword, Sword, or Broadsword (as each of them grant proficiency with the Sommerswerd). It is not an additional bonus. When used in combat, treat it like a one-handed sword, regardless of Weaponskill bonus.

Turn to <a href="sect186.htm">Section 186</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect290.htm#sect290-1">12</a>]  (<a href="sect290.htm">Section 290</a>) You must eat another Meal in place of this poisoned food or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect299.htm#sect299-1">13</a>]  (<a href="sect299.htm">Section 299</a>) See the <a href="errata.htm">erratum</a> for this section for details of the gameplay changes made to this section. Note: the results of the choices presented here are discussed.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect311.htm#sect311-1">14</a>]  (<a href="sect311.htm">Section 311</a>) If you have not already been told, the Helghast are the riders who attacked your party. Helghast are ‘fell captains of the Darklords. They have the ability to adopt human form but are invulnerable to normal weapons.’</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect327.htm#sect327-1">15</a>]  (<a href="sect327.htm">Section 327</a>) If you do not have 6 Gold Crowns, the boy will sell the papers to you for however many you have, including 0 Crowns. These papers need not be marked on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (and thus do not require a Backpack to carry them in). Without these papers, it would be possible to wander endlessly in Port Bax.</p></div>
