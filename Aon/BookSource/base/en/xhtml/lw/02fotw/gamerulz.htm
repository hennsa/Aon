<h2>The Game Rules</h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and physical stamina—<span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of 14). When you fight, your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed Book 1 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points, and <a href="discplnz.htm">Kai Disciplines</a> which you can now carry over with you to Book 2. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of Book 1 and these should be entered on your new <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>Through your experiences in <a href="../../lw/01fftd/title.htm">Book 1</a> you have learned new skills, and you may choose one extra <a href="discplnz.htm">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. Now read the <a href="equipmnt.htm">section on equipment</a> for Book 2 carefully.</p>
