<h3>194</h3>

<p>When you awake, you are shocked to find yourself lying beneath a wooden jetty, and the shallow water surrounding you fills your nostrils with a foul stench. As you stand, your head throbs violently as if you had been knocked unconscious. This is exactly what has happened to you, and your Gold, your Backpack, your Weapons, and all your Special Items (including the Seal of Hammerdal) have been stolen by the fishermen.<sup><a href="#sect194-1-foot" name="sect194-1">8</a></sup></p>
<p>With a groan of despair, you climb out of the slimy water and pull yourself onto the jetty. Looking up you see a faded sign.</p>
<div class="signpost">Welcome to Ragadorn</div>
<p>You fear the rumours about this place are true. It is nearly dark and it has started to rain. You must find the Seal if you are to persuade the Durenese to give you the Sommerswerd. Looking round, you see a large market square with a stone signpost in the centre, indicating the various roads that lead off the square.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go east along Barnacle Street <a href="sect215.htm">turn to 215</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go south along Eastbank Wharf, <a href="sect303.htm">turn to 303</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go north along Booty Walk, <a href="sect129.htm">turn to 129</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather go west back to the jetty and search for the fishing boat, <a href="sect86.htm">turn to 86</a>.</p>
