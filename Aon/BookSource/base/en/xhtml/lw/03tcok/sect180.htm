<h3>180</h3>

<p>Through the snow-swept gloom you can make out two small pinpoints of red light. They are growing larger. Suddenly, in the gloom you see the shape of a large and hideous, four-legged creature. It leaps at you, its red eyes glowering and its fanged mouth open to reveal a long barbed tongue, lashing towards your face.</p>
<p>‘Agh! A Kalkoth!’ screams Fenor. He rushes to your side, holding a sword high in his hand. He attempts to strike at the creature’s tongue. But the creature is already upon you, and you must fight it.</p>
<p>In spite of Fenor’s attack the beast only seems to be interested in you. Fenor does not receive any wounds as he stabs at it from behind.</p>
<p>Deduct an additional 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points from the Kalkoth’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point total for each round of combat you fight. This represents the damage inflicted by Fenor.</p>
<p class="combat">Kalkoth: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 11   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 35</p>
<p class="choice">If you lose any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points during this combat, <a href="sect129.htm">turn immediately to 129</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you kill the creature without losing any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points, <a href="sect70.htm">turn to 70</a>.</p>
