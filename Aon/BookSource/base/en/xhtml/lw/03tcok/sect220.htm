<h3>220</h3>

<p>The next day is bitterly cold. A strong wind from the west blows relentlessly as you steer your sledge towards the Hrod Basin. The snow clogs your eyes and your lips crack and bleed, but by midday you reach the edge of the basin. Irian and Dyce’s sledge arrives at the ice wall first and they eagerly encourage you onwards.</p>
<p>Without any warning, a great crack appears between the two sledges, opening with a tremendous roar, until you are faced by a huge dark crevasse. Frantically you pull on the reins but it is too late to prevent your Kanu-dog team from disappearing into the void. Your sledge is left balancing on the edge of the crevasse, while the team of howling Kanu-dogs dangle helplessly in their harnesses below you. Very carefully, you risk a glance into the chasm. You see that the first two dogs have broken free and dropped over one-hundred-and-fifty feet to a ledge below. One of them appears to be dead. The other is badly injured and whimpers beside the still body of its comrade. Suddenly, a shudder jolts the sledge and you gasp with fright.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to crawl with Fenor to the rear of the sledge, <a href="sect146.htm">turn to 146</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to try to leap clear of the sledge onto the cracked ice, <a href="sect29.htm">turn to 29</a>.</p>
