<h3>257</h3>

<p>A shiver runs up your spine as Dyce’s screams fade away into the dark gorge. You are staring into the inky blackness when Irian suddenly shouts: ‘There … over there. I’m sure I saw something.’</p>
<p>You turn to see him pointing not at the gorge but towards the west. ‘Look, over there,’ says Fenor, who is also pointing, but at a ridge of ice in the middle distance. Two fur-clad warriors are standing on top of a large slab of ice. They stare in your direction, alerted no doubt by Dyce’s scream.</p>
<p>‘Ice Barbarians,’ whispers Irian, his voice shaking with fear. ‘If they reach Ikaya before us, we’re as good as dead.’</p>
<p>You are still fifteen miles from the ice fortress and less than three hours of daylight remain.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to outrun the Ice Barbarians and press on to Ikaya, <a href="sect327.htm">turn to 327</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to attack them to prevent them raising the alarm, <a href="sect307.htm">turn to 307</a>.</p>
