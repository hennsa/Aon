<h3>284</h3>

<p>After a few hundred yards, you find yourself in a huge cavern that spreads out in all directions as far as the eye can see. You have entered the caverns of Kalte and are now looking at an uncharted world that few Sommlending have ever seen. This massive underground labyrinth was constructed by the Ancients many ages before the Sommlending set foot in Magnamund. Its wide avenues, temples, and arenas once echoed to the sounds of a race of creatures for whom the ice was a natural home. M’lare bowls still hang from the ceiling bathing the caverns in their eternal light.</p>
<p>You trek steadily northwards for nearly six hours, until you arrive at the bank of a fast-flowing melt-water river. On the opposite bank, you see a tunnel leading off into the distance. You can find no apparent way of crossing the deep water, except by using the ice-floes bobbing up and down on the surface. By jumping from one floe to the next, you could get to the opposite bank, but it will not be easy. You will have to jump at least three of the icy slabs to reach the other side.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Kai Discipline of Hunting, you may add 2 to the number you have picked. If your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points total is less than 8, deduct 2 from the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now −2–+3, <a href="sect94.htm">turn to 94</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 4–11, <a href="sect176.htm">turn to 176</a>.</p>
