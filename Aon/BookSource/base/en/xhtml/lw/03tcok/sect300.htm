<h3>300</h3>

<p>For three days and nights, you trek northwards across the bleak and inhospitable glacier. Irian and Fenor have both suffered from severe snow-blindness, and the relentless north wind seems to sap everyone’s strength. On the morning of the fourth day on the glacier, the wind finally drops. A bearing can now be taken to find out your exact position. To everyone’s dismay Irian announces that you have veered a long way off course.</p>
<p>You turn to face the ancient grey peaks of a mountain range, looming up out of the northern snow. It is a bleak and forbidding sight. ‘The Myjaviks,’ says Dyce, disappointment written all over his bearded face. ‘We’ve come too far east.’</p>
<p>The Myjavik Mountains now lie between you and Ikaya. To cross them will mean having to leave the sledges and Kanu-dogs, packing your equipment on your backs and continuing on foot. There is an alternative, but it could lose you two precious days: you can retrace your route to the glacier and resume the march from there.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to abandon the dogs and sledges, and cross the Myjavik Mountains on foot, <a href="sect12.htm">turn to 12</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to lose two days and trace your way back to the Viad Glacier, <a href="sect238.htm">turn to 238</a>.</p>
