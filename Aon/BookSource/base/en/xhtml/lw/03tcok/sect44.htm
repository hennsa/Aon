<h3>44</h3>

<p>‘Follow me,’ says Loi-Kymar. ‘I’ve listened to the sounds of Ikaya for over a year, and the secret sliding doors and the hidden routes here are no mystery to me. I have learnt more about these corridors and passages from the confines of my cell than Vonotar has discovered with all of his cunning.’</p>
<p>You follow the old magician through a network of secret passages and tunnels, up long flights of stairs and into chambers dark and cold. At the top of one very steep staircase, you come to a stone door. A strange, sickly smell is seeping from a small spy-hole. ‘The kitchens,’ whispers Loi-Kymar, showing his distaste for Ikaya cuisine by sticking out his tongue and grimacing.</p>
<p>You can see that this secret door opens next to a fireplace in which burns a roaring fire. Hanging over the fire is a large stone cauldron of gruel. Two Ice Barbarians sit at a table nearby with empty bowls in front of them.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Potion of Black Graveweed, <a href="sect79.htm">turn to 79</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Potion of Green Gallowbrush, <a href="sect157.htm">turn to 157</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess either of these potions, you can open the secret door and launch a surprise attack upon the unarmed Ice Barbarians, by <a href="sect270.htm">turning to 270</a>.</p>
