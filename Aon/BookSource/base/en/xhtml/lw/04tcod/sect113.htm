<h3>113</h3>

<p>You enter the forest and descend the wooded hillside towards the River Xane. You have gone only a few yards when the trees become far too dense for you to be able to continue on horseback. Reluctantly, you signal to your men to dismount and continue on foot.</p>
<p>You soon reach the river and follow the foam-flecked water upstream. The climb takes you through a maze of wide rock terraces worn smooth by the force of the river. Then, at a point where the torrent is fed by many smaller streams, you catch sight of six bandits, stabbing at the water with their spears as it thunders along the smooth-hewn channels. On the far bank, you can see a pile of grey fish standing next to a horse-drawn wagon, which you recognize as a Sommlending cavalry wagon.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have reached the Kai rank of Warmarn, <a href="sect166.htm">turn to 166</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have yet to reach this level of Kai training, you can launch a surprise attack on the bandits and <a href="sect14.htm">turn to 14</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather try to sneak across the river under the cover of the many large boulders that divert the watercourse, <a href="sect316.htm">turn to 316</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather avoid crossing here and head back the way you have just come, <a href="sect232.htm">turn to 232</a>.</p>
