<h3>2</h3>

<p>You search the bodies of the dead bandits and discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>12 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Backpack</li>
<li>Enough food for 2 Meals</li>
</ul>
<p>You may take any of the above items but be sure to mark them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Picking up the map that lies on the bloodstained table, you notice that the room in which you now stand has been surrounded by a circle of black ink. The map reveals that a door in the far wall opens on to a passageway leading directly to the surface. Eager to leave the death-filled chamber, you pass through the door and run steadily along the passageway towards a distant shaft of sunlight. It takes several seconds for your eyes to adjust to the glare of the sun, but gradually you realize that you have finally escaped from the Maaken Mines and are in the western foothills less than two miles from Ruanon itself.</p>
<p>However, several bandit warriors can be seen patrolling an entrance to the mines, just below the rocky ledge on which you now crouch. If you are to reach Ruanon alive, you must avoid these patrols at all costs.</p>
<p>Waiting until the enemy patrols have disappeared from view, you make your way down a steep track leading into a copse of densely packed trees. A brief pause for breath is all that you allow yourself before setting off through the forest towards Ruanon.</p>
