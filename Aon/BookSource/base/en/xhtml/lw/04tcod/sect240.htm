<h3>240</h3>

<p>For over ten miles, the river wends its steady course southwards. You pass through several grottos, but their rocky banks are so steep that they make a landing impossible. You are rowing along a particularly wide tunnel when you suddenly realize that the boat is moving faster and faster, and the faint sound of rushing water is gradually increasing. Soon the whole tunnel is filled with a thundering cacophony of noise.</p>
<p>You brace yourself in preparation for rough water, but you are totally unprepared for the sight that befalls you. Less than fifty feet away, the river disappears over the edge of a massive waterfall. Desperately your men row against the current towards the tunnel wall, but it is too late: you are caught in the current and are hurtling towards the edge of the waterfall.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number that you have picked is 0–4, <a href="sect94.htm">turn to 94</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5–9, <a href="sect158.htm">turn to 158</a>.</p>
