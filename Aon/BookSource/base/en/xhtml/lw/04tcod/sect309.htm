<h3>309</h3>

<p>You follow the tunnel for three hours before arriving at a great hall where several tunnels, all at different depths, meet up. A series of wide stone ramps connect each tunnel to those immediately above and below. Four levels below you, teams of men are pushing wagonloads of ore. Others, dressed in red armour, stand guard over the wagon-pushers and urge them on with whips and curses.</p>
<p>The tunnel in which you now stand is on the highest level. You realize that the only way you can proceed is by descending the ramp to a tunnel on a lower level. To your dismay, you notice that each of the ramps is guarded by armed men. Inching forward, you peer over the edge of the ramp; two guards are sitting near the tunnel entrance below. They are laughing and giggling and pointing at an empty wine flagon that lies at their feet. After watching them for several minutes, you decide they are probably too drunk to notice you. You decide to make a dash for the tunnel.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess the Kai Discipline of Camouflage, add 4 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0–7, <a href="sect138.htm">turn to 138</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is 8–13, <a href="sect244.htm">turn to 244</a>.</p>
