<h3>248</h3>

<p>A small, heavy-set merchant is hawking his wares from a stall set close to the archway. His small, beady eyes twinkle from beneath a ridiculously outsized turban. As you approach, he launches himself at you, desperately trying, with a flood of wild claims, to persuade you to buy his obviously inferior goods. He looks surprised when you interrupt him with your question. ‘Tipasa?’ he answers. ‘Yes, I know where he lives.’</p>
<p>He holds up a gaudy waistcoat of pink and orange sackcloth and offers it to you. ‘It would make a worthy gift for your esteemed friend,’ he suggests, his eyes continually glancing at your Belt Pouch. ‘Only 5 Gold Crowns, master.’</p>
<p>You realize you will first have to purchase this ridiculous garment before the merchant will tell you where Tipasa lives.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to buy the waistcoat, pay the man 5 Gold Crowns and <a href="sect328.htm">turn to 328</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not want to buy the waistcoat or cannot afford to pay him 5 Gold Crowns, <a href="sect274.htm">turn to 274</a>.</p>
