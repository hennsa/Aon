<h3>302</h3>

<p>Banedon takes over the helm as his extraordinary ship, the <cite>Skyrider</cite>, as the dwarves call it, speeds through the gathering darkness towards the Dahir Pass. Visibility diminishes with each passing minute until, finally, you can see no further than the outriggers. You feel uneasy; if the <cite>Skyrider</cite> veers but a fraction off course, you will be smashed to pieces against the mountainside.</p>
<p>‘Do not worry, Lone Wolf,’ says Nolrim, the dwarf with the velvet satchel. ‘The captain will see us through.’</p>
<p>Banedon stands with his hand resting lightly on the glowing crystal, relaxed as if in a trance. His eyes are closed and a crackle of energy, like fine white lightning, traces an intricate pattern over his forehead and temples.</p>
<p>The dwarf leads you to the cabin at the rear of the craft where the crew are excitedly recounting their victory over the Kraan-riders. They are seated about a table cluttered with plates of steaming food and jugs of foaming ale. The rich smell of spiced meat and Bor-brew fills your nostrils, reminding you of how ravenously hungry you are.</p>
<p>You make short work of the meat and marrow placed before you. Restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. However, you are unsure about accepting a jug of ale; Bor-brew is so strong that in many cities of Magnamund it has been banned for fear of the havoc it can cause.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accept a jug of the notorious ale, <a href="sect392.htm">turn to 392</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to decline the offer, <a href="sect283.htm">turn to 283</a>.</p>
