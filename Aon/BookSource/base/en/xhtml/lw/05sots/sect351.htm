<h3>351</h3>

<p>As you approach the door, Banedon offers you a word of advice. ‘Take care to guard your gold, Lone Wolf. Nothing tempts the Ikareshi more than a full purse. You can trust their honour, but if you trust their honesty they will steal the hair from your head.’</p>
<p>Inside, the mood is one of celebration. Tables have been drawn together to form a large semicircle in front of which stands a small, broad-shouldered man dressed lavishly in an embroidered costume. A gold-mounted sword hangs by his side, its blue velvet scabbard as vivid in colour as the man’s silk pantaloons. Affectionately, the man embraces his companions, kissing the friends and relatives who have travelled so many miles to celebrate his wedding. At his side sits his bride, her face concealed behind a veil of shimmering pearls. Suddenly, the tavern is filled with music as the guests take the floor for the wedding dance.</p>
<p>On the far side of the floor you see the owner of the tavern, a stout old lady dressed in sombre black. She watches the festivities with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to approach her and ask where Tipasa the Wanderer may be found, <a href="sect276.htm">turn to 276</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to leave the tavern and continue along the street, <a href="sect202.htm">turn to 202</a>.</p>
