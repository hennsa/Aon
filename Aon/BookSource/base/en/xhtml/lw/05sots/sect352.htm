<h3>352</h3>

<p>Beyond the portal lies a vaulted corridor leading to a grand stairway. You narrowly avoid confrontation with a dozen Drakkarim, saved by your lightning reactions. As the enemy rush from an archway on the second floor landing, you dive behind a statue of the recently deceased Zakhan Moudalla. They are so intent on their chase that they fail to notice your hiding place and hurry down the stairs, grunting in their heavy armour as they run. Silently, you give thanks that Zakhan Moudalla was a very stout man and that his statue casts a very large shadow in which to hide.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairway you discover a hatch, which gives access to the roof. You climb through it and follow a path of sun-bleached tiles that wind in and out of the domes and turrets, eventually leading to a bell-tower.</p>
<p>You are exhausted and need to rest, your mind still full of the shock of your encounter with Darklord Haakon. The sound of his terrible voice repeating the words ‘<cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>’ echoes again and again in your mind.</p>
<p>With desperation sapping your will, you peer out through a grille in the bell-tower. The sight before you renews your flagging hope, for it inspires a daring escape plan.</p>
