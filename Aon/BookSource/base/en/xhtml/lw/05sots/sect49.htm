<h3>49</h3>

<p>The outer wall of the Grand Palace is far too high to climb, and even if you had a rope long enough, your green Kai cloak would be seen for miles, set against the white, sun-bleached marble wall.</p>
<p>You crouch in the shadow of a doorway while you concentrate on working out a plan. There is a constant traffic of mounted scouts and couriers from the north gate. Those arriving hand a scroll of parchment to two of the guards before they enter. Slowly, a bold plan begins to take shape in your mind. If you could overpower one of the couriers before he reaches the palace gate, you could disguise yourself in his clothes and use his scroll to gain entrance.</p>
<p>Many of the couriers approach the Grand Palace from the harbour, and although it is infested with troops, you discover the ideal place to ambush a rider. There is a broad avenue where a bridge of gnarled old wood and metal curves over the street, and here, beneath the wooden arch, you lie in wait for your prey.</p>
<p>Your chance soon arrives; a black-robed rider enters the avenue and spurs his horse along the street. He will have to pass beneath the arch. You prepare to pounce.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Kai Discipline of Hunting, add 1 to the number you have picked. If you have reached the Kai rank of Savant, add 3 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0–5, <a href="sect106.htm">turn to 106</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 6–13, <a href="sect189.htm">turn to 189</a>.</p>
