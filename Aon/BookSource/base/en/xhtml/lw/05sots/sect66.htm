<h3>66</h3>

<p>A sour-faced guard with a whip stands at the great doors to the kitchen. He delights in bullying the slaves that pass to and fro, lashing them with his whip and cursing them foully. You decide it is far too risky to confront the guard and instead focus your attention on the kitchen windows. The guard is too engrossed in beating an unfortunate slave who has dropped a basket of fruit to notice you sprint across the gardens and leap into the shadow of a tall, arched kitchen window. Then, to your horror, you notice that two guards are seated inside the kitchen, just below the window ledge on which you now stand. If they should so much as turn their heads, you will be seen.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to jump back into the palace gardens and try to enter the palace through the Zakhan’s trophy room, <a href="sect149.htm">turn to 149</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to launch a surprise attack on the seated guards, before they notice you are there, <a href="sect124.htm">turn to 124</a>.</p>
