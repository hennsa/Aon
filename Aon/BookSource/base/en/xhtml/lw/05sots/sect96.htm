<h3>96</h3>

<p>The water is clotted with a revolting variety of green and black muck and scum. It reaches up to your waist, and, as you force your way through the glutinous mire, the surface film breaks, releasing a vile gas. You have to cover your nose and mouth with your Kai cloak, for the stench is appalling. A sudden splash warns that Maouk’s men are not far behind.</p>
<p>Your foot catches in something buried in the silt of the tunnel floor, and for one brief second, you are seized by total panic. You struggle to kick free but are held fast. Blindly, you stab your weapon beneath the filthy water until your foot is finally freed. As you withdraw your weapon, you half-expect to find some hideous sewer creature impaled upon it. Instead, you discover a human rib cage. You shudder and flick the bones back into the stinking mire.</p>
<p>The channel soon divides: the new tunnel heads west and the other continues southwards. The splashing has grown steadily louder—Maouk’s men are gaining on you.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to head west, <a href="sect135.htm">turn to 135</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue south, <a href="sect164.htm">turn to 164</a>.</p>
