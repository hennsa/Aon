<h3>119</h3>

<p>Cyrilus’ eyes open with such surprise that you can see the startled whites around his mousy-brown pupils. ‘Lone Wolf,’ he whispers, incredulously, ‘I should have known. Humble apologies, my lord. I thought that you sought the Lorestone for less than honourable reasons.’</p>
<p>Cyrilus talks at great length about the legend of the Lorestone. You learn that it remained in Varetta after Sun Eagle’s quest, where it was set into the throne of Lyris in the Tower of the King. Hundreds of years ago, during the War of the Lorestone, it was stolen by a Salonese prince called Kaskor. He set the stone upon a gold sceptre and used it in battle to inspire his fanatical followers and crush his foes. He believed it made him invulnerable, but this was not so—he was killed on his royal barge during a battle at Rhem, and the Lorestone was lost when the gold sceptre fell from his hand into the depths of the River Storn. There were many accounts of the sceptre having been found, but they had always proved to be untrue or simply fanciful. It was said that whoever wielded the Lorestone was the rightful ruler of all the Stornlands. For this reason alone it was often sought by evil or unscrupulous warlords, and many had pursued the quest, all without success.</p>

<p>Cyrilus does not know where the Lorestone is, but he does know a man in Varetta who claims to know its exact whereabouts. ‘Let me ride with you to Varetta; in return for the privilege I shall take you to this man.’ Your basic Kai instincts tell you his offer is genuine. You nod your agreement and arrange to meet him in the tavern courtyard at dawn.</p>
