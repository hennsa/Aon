<h3>124</h3>

<p>The city is choked with people: mercenaries from the north and west, weapon merchants from the east, and ragged refugees from the war-torn south. The captain orders his men to sleep aboard the <cite>Kazonara</cite> this night, forbidding them to go ashore, for Prince Balonn of Rioma and his mercenary knights are encamped inside the city wall. A bitter and long-standing rivalry exists between the two companies, and the captain wisely wishes to avoid any confrontation.</p>
<p>Rumour has it that a number of the Stornlands’ most powerful princes are gathered in Rhem to plot the defeat of the Slovians. However, the captain believes it is more likely that the robber-barons are conspiring against each other to steal the riches of Tekaro for themselves.</p>
<p>You set sail at first light, bidding farewell to the slender twin-towers of the Rhem citadel, which overshadows the city quay. The Storn flows southwards through steep-sided fields of vines, arranged in endless straight rows like the waves of a green sea. The weather is warm, and you spend the day on deck watching the traffic of refugees heading north along a highway and the strange gigantic toads, the sloats, at work, pulling riverboats and barges upstream.</p>
<p>It is late afternoon when you sight the town of Eula in the distance. You saddle your horse and shoulder your equipment as the <cite>Kazonara</cite> berths at the town’s wooden pier.</p>
<p class="choice">If you purchased a Riverboat Ticket for the riverboat at Soren, <a href="sect59.htm">turn to 59</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not have a Riverboat Ticket, <a href="sect290.htm">turn to 290</a>.</p>
