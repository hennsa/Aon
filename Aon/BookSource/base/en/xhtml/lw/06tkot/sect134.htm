<h3>134</h3>

<p>Beyond the Taunor valley, the highway twists and climbs across wooded hillsides, often plunging into narrow valleys where bubbling, trout-laden streams wend their way southwards to the Quarl. Butterflies gather in clouds above clumps of sweet-smelling flowers bordering the road, and the constant twitterings of bird song add a sense of tranquillity to the beautiful countryside.</p>
<p>‘It comforts me to know there is still one part of Lyris where war and death are unfamiliar visitors,’ says Cyrilus, puffing nonchalantly on a long-stemmed clay pipe. ‘Alas, nowadays, such peace is rare.’</p>
<p>The highway passes the ruins of a monastery and then descends steeply towards some log huts, clustered in a semicircle at the approach to a stone bridge. A tall gate, flanked by two mighty towers of stone, commands the access to the bridge.</p>
<p>‘The Denka Gate,’ says Cyrilus. ‘The toll is 3 Gold Crowns to cross the bridge, unless, of course, the gatekeeper is your brother.’ He gives a sly wink and smiles. ‘This may take a while—I haven’t seen my brother Esmond for over a month, and he is bound to want to hear all the latest gossip from Quarlen before he lets us cross.’</p>
<p>Cyrilus points out two of the log huts where wooden signs, carved in the shapes of an ale tankard and a loaf of bread, hang above the doors. ‘The best ale and bread in all of Lyris. Mention my name and you’ll be treated like a king.’</p>
<p>You are feeling hungry and thirsty after your long ride, and the prospect of free refreshment is very tempting.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter the ale hut, <a href="sect185.htm">turn to 185</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter the bread hut, <a href="sect287.htm">turn to 287</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to stay with Cyrilus and approach the Denka Gate, <a href="sect89.htm">turn to 89</a>.</p>
