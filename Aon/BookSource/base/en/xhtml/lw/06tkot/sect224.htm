<h3>224</h3>

<p>‘Hell’s teeth!’ cries the captain. ‘Have we run aground?’</p>
<p>As the words leave his lips, a grapnel and rope drop from the sky and bite into the ship’s rail. More follow and, through the mist, you can make out the shapes of longboats approaching.</p>
<p>‘River pirates!’ shouts the helmsman. ‘Prepare to repel boarders.’</p>
<p>Further along the deck, one of the captain’s men is felled by a thrown knife. His comrades rush to his aid, but by now the river pirates are pouring over the side and he is trampled underfoot.</p>
<p>‘Battle order!’ bellows the captain and immediately his men respond, linking shields and holding their ground. A swarm of grim-faced pirates are boarding close by. One of their number, a lean man with only one ear and a split nose, smiles at you with anticipation, his lips drawn back from his teeth and his eyes wide with excitement. He is obviously relishing the thought of ending your life.</p>
