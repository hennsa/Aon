<h3>24</h3>

<p>The chapel has lain derelict for many years, exposed to the elements. Very little has survived. In one corner you discover a gaping hole that opens onto another room below. Its floor is covered with large, shiny black puddles, and the overpowering stench of mould and decay is carried upwards by a howling draught. A rat sits on the remains of a corpse, staring up at you in surprise, the dull green light of the chapel reflecting in its peppercorn eyes. As you become accustomed to the gloom, you realize that this room is, in fact, full of corpses: the unfortunate victims of the Yawshath. Then your gaze is drawn to a gleaming bronze warhammer that lies across the chest of a corpse. Everything below is covered in mould except for this weapon which still shines as if it were brand new.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, <a href="sect276.htm">turn to 276</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a rope, you can attempt to retrieve the warhammer by <a href="sect101.htm">turning to 101</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather ignore the weapon and return to Cyrilus, <a href="sect338.htm">turn to 338</a>.</p>
