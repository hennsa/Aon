<h3>33</h3>

<p>A shock awaits you on your return to Cyrilus: both he and your horse have vanished. At first you curse him, thinking that he has wandered off to a nearby ale tent for a drink, but when you discover his oaken staff lying beside the road, you sense that something is seriously wrong.</p>
<p>You climb to the top of a parked wagon and strain your eyes in all directions for some clue to his whereabouts. Suddenly you see him, surrounded by a group of cavalrymen galloping away to the west. You count six of them plus a riderless horse—your horse. Then you notice that conveniently hitched to the back of the parked wagon is a saddled horse.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take the horse and give chase, <a href="sect271.htm">turn to 271</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to find the horse’s owner and offer to buy it, <a href="sect325.htm">turn to 325</a>.</p>
