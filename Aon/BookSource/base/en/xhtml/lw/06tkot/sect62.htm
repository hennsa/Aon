<p>You are correct: the boy has blond hair and the girl has black hair. Your logical thinking revealed they could not both have been speaking the truth, for the conjurer had said that at least one of them was lying—and if one was lying then the other could not have been speaking the truth. Therefore, there was only one conclusion to be drawn: both lied.</p>
<p>The conjurer pays you the number of Gold Crowns equal to that which you wagered. Remember to add this sum to your current total of Gold Crowns before approaching the bar and enquiring about a room for the night.</p>
