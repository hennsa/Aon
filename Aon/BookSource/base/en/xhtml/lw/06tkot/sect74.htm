<h3>74</h3>

<p>You do not have to wait very long for the riders to appear. As soon as they think you have gone, they emerge in single file from the back of a derelict cottage and draw themselves into a circle in the middle of the village. Although they are out of earshot, you can tell by their frantic movements and gestures that they are having a heated argument. Suddenly, they break the circle and ride towards you. Cyrilus, still lying unconscious across his horse, is in tow behind the last rider.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a Bow and want to ambush them as they ride past your hiding place, <a href="sect20.htm">turn to 20</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the last rider and try to recapture Cyrilus, <a href="sect203.htm">turn to 203</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to let them pass and then follow them, <a href="sect227.htm">turn to 227</a>.</p>
