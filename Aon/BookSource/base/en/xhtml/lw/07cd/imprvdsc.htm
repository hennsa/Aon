<h3>Improved Disciplines</h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will steadily improve. If you are a Kai Master that has reached the rank of Primate, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>
<h4><a name="primate">Primate</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Primates with this Magnakai Discipline are able to repel an animal that is intent on harming them by blocking its sense of taste and smell. The level of success is dependent on the size and ferocity of the animal.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have the ability to delay the effects of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison he is able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and are able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Primates with the skill of Nexus will be able to offer a far greater resistance than before to the effects of noxious gases and fumes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Magnakai Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books.</p>
