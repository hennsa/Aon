<h3>15</h3>

<p>You spin a screw-like handle set in the centre of the door, releasing the lock. You open the door and enter: inside, you discover a room of steel. The walls, ceiling, and floor are all constructed of metal plate, which is polished to give a mirror-like shine. Low, iron tables are set out with the implements and accessories of magic: crucibles, retorts, aludels, flasks, and all manner of twisting glass tubes, which bubble and seethe with multi-coloured liquids. Vellum-bound tomes and crumbling parchments litter the shelves, competing for space with repulsive-looking pink organs floating in glass jars of vile-smelling preservative. Quickly you scan the shelves in search of useful items and, to your delight, rediscover all your confiscated Weapons. (Re-enter on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> everything that was taken from you before you were sent to the maze.)</p>
<p>In addition to your Weapons, you discover a large jar of concentrated Laumspur (restores 8 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points) and a Kazan-Oud Platinum Amulet. If you wish to take the Amulet, mark it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item, which you wear on your wrist. It will protect you from injury due to exposure to high temperatures.</p>
<p>Elated by the rediscovery of your equipment, you leave the chamber and press on along the shiny steel tube.</p>
