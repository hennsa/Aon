<h3>340</h3>

<p>You tell him of your quest and the help the Elder Magi have given to enable you to enter Kazan-Oud. When you recount your air voyage to Herdos aboard Lord Paido’s skyship, you notice a tear trickle from the blind man’s eye. ‘My name is Kasin,’ he says, sorrowfully. ‘Lord Paido is my brother.’</p>
<p>Pity fills your heart for this unfortunate warrior, for you know that he is doomed to die. Blindness occurs in the final stage of takadea, the disease that is ravaging his body. ‘I am beyond help,’ he says, his face lined with pain, ‘but I can and will help your quest, Kai Lord. Listen to me carefully. There are stairs at the end of the corridor that lead down to the throne-hall of Zahda. At the entrance to the hall there is a tapestry behind which there is a secret passage. It leads to Zahda’s throne. Above the throne is the Lorestone you seek, but beware. Zahda has coupled its power to a Doomstone from the realm of Naaros—Zahda draws all his power from this accursed gem. If you are to succeed, you must first destroy the gem or you will surely perish. Sadly I cannot help you escape from Kazan-Oud, for I myself was captured long before I reached the surface, but if you reach the beach, make your way to the old stone jetty. Beneath the steps is the place where I hid my boat.’</p>
<p>He grips your hand in friendship, his face now calm and peaceful. ‘When you return to Elzian, tell my brother that my death was not in vain. May the gods protect you, Lone Wolf.’</p>
<p>The sound of approaching guards forces you to leave the cell. As you close the door, you promise that his bravery will live forever in the legends of the Vakeros—his warrior kin.</p>
