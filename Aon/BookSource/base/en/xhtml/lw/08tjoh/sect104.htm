<h3>104</h3>

<p>The sudden chill of cold water on your brow makes you open your eyes with a start. Blinking away the droplets, you shake your head and a terrible pain shoots through your skull, making you curse and grit your teeth: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Strong hands lift you off the floor and steer you towards a quiet corner of the tap-room where Paido sits, grinning broadly. ‘That Bor Brew packs a vicious punch,’ he says, blithely, barely able to conceal his amusement at the effect the ale has had on you.</p>
<p>‘It’s got a taste like nectar but the kick of an angry mule!’ replies the man in red, who has helped you across the floor. As your vision and the pain in your head begin to clear, you notice that he is a soldier. He wears the scarlet tunic of the Tharro garrison, emblazoned with their insignia of a castle and an open hand. You apologize for the trouble you have caused and offer to buy him a drink to make amends. He accepts but on one condition—that you do not have another Bor Brew!</p>
