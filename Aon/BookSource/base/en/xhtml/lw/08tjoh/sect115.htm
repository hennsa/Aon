<h3>115</h3>

<p>The hiss of the crossbow bolt is followed, almost instantaneously, by a terrible pain that paralyses your left arm. You are knocked over by the force of the missile and crack your head heavily on the sawdust-strewn floor: lose 8 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Through a reddish haze, you see Paido draw a dagger and hurl it at the dwarf; it sinks into his black beard and sends him tumbling backwards. He reappears for an instant, desperately trying to dislodge the blade buried deep in his throat with his fingers, but he has suffered a fatal wound. He gurgles a death-cry and drops to the floor, his flailing arms bringing down a shelf full of bottles.</p>
<p>Carefully Paido raises you to your feet, supporting your weight as you stagger to the stables. Your wounded arm is streaming blood, and with every passing second, you drift towards unconsciousness.</p>
