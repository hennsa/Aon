<h3>117</h3>

<p>The archery range is a long and narrow room lit by torches set into the walls at regular intervals. At the far end are three targets bound with wire to bales of hay. Each target is the same size as the one you saw earlier, hanging behind the counter, but instead of rings, they each display the silhouette of a different creature: the left target shows a man; the centre one shows a wolf; and the right target shows a bear. You hand the owner your Silver Bow and he chooses three arrows from a rack on the wall. He praises the balance and fine workmanship of the bow as he draws the bowstring and takes aim at the centre target.</p>
<p>‘Head!’ he says, and releases the shaft. The arrow whistles to the target and sinks into the head of the wolf silhouette. ‘Rump!’ he calls on the second shot, shooting the arrow exactly in the target’s hind quarters. ‘And now for the last,’ he says, taking care to load the bow correctly; ‘the heart of the wolf.’</p>
<p>Suddenly he turns and fires. The arrow comes screaming towards your chest.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, add 3 to the number you have picked. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Divination and have reached the rank of Primate, add 1 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 0–4, <a href="sect154.htm">turn to 154</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5–8, <a href="sect40.htm">turn to 40</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 9 or more, <a href="sect251.htm">turn to 251</a>.</p>
