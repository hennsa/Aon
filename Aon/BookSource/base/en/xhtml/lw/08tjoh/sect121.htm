<h3>121</h3>

<p>Paido’s coma deepens. Shortly after midnight, his heart and brain cease to function and he slips painlessly into death. Grief fills your senses and you mourn the loss of your brave companion, but your grief soon turns to anger as you remember the foul trickery that ended his life and so nearly put an end to yours.</p>
<p>A rage grows within you. You take Paido’s sword and vow to avenge his death by washing it in the blood of his murderers. Heedless of caution and the warning cry of your senses, you throw open the cellar door and go in search of vengeance.</p>
<p>You have taken only a few paces along the corridor when a terrific explosion lifts you off your feet. The monks followed your trail to the cellar and prepared a surprise for you. You have tripped a wire and activated an explosive charge set into the floor. When the monks come to inspect their handiwork, they will discover your remains lying in the rubble.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>
