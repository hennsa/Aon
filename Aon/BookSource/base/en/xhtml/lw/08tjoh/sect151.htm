<h3>151</h3>

<p>The hold is crowded with travellers on their way north. For most it is a regular journey home after selling their wares in Phoena. Their purses are full and their mood is friendly as they pass the time drinking and playing games of chance.</p>
<p>One of the crew glances up from serving and, wiping his hands on his apron, hurries over to welcome you to the floating tavern. He points to a plank table at the far end of the hold that is bowed beneath the weight of several kegs of ale and platters of food. He asks if you would care for some refreshment.</p>
<p>‘Two jugs of ale,’ replies Paido, reaching for his pouch of crowns.</p>
<p>‘Certainly, sir,’ replies the bargee, in a servile tone. ‘I have three fine ales to delight your palates—Ferina Nog, Chai-cheer, and Bor Brew.’</p>
<p>Paido chooses a jug of Ferina Nog. Which ale will you choose?</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose Ferina Nog, <a href="sect173.htm">turn to 173</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose Chai-cheer, <a href="sect218.htm">turn to 218</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose Bor Brew, <a href="sect284.htm">turn to 284</a>.</p>
