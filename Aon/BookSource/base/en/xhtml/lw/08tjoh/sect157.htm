<h3>157</h3>

<p>At the top of the stairs you pass through a curtained archway and step into a large prayer hall. A central aisle separates the pews of white wood, which face a golden pulpit with a facia shaped to resemble a flaming sword. Carefully you rest Paido on a pew and examine the glass vial you found in the kitchen. Your fears and suspicions are soon confirmed—it contains poison. The clear, sticky fluid is sap from the gnadurn tree, a substance used frequently by assassins because of its lack of flavour or scent. The monks must have put some of this poison in the food that Paido unwittingly consumed. The sap is deadly, and you must act quickly if you are to save your companion’s life.</p>
<p>You hear the sound of running feet and the growl of dogs off the leash at the bottom of the stairs. Once more you shoulder your burden, carrying Paido towards the far end of the hall in search of an exit. Behind a drawn curtain you discover a door, but it is locked and bolted from the other side. The noise of your pursuers grows louder as they climb the stairs to the hall.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Invisibility and have reached the rank of Tutelary, <a href="sect67.htm">turn to 67</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach the rank of Tutelary, you can hide in the pulpit by <a href="sect96.htm">turning to 96</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">Or you can hide among the pews by <a href="sect198.htm">turning to 198</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">Or you can stand in the central aisle and await your pursuers by <a href="sect305.htm">turning to 305</a>.</p>
