<h3>192</h3>

<p>You tend to Paido’s wound, using your basic Kai knowledge of healing to prevent an infection from taking hold, before continuing deeper into the swamp. The ankle-deep ooze that borders the pool gives way to firmer ground, and you arrive shortly at a place where a tree bearing blood-red fruit overhangs a pool of clear water. You stop here to rest and dislodge the tiny leeches that are feasting on your legs.</p>
<p>Paido climbs the tree to scan the horizon. He carries with him a starguider, a homing device invented by the Elder Magi to enable their flying ships to navigate in the dark. It is sensitive to the vibrations of korlinium crystals. The spire of the Temple of Ohrido is solid korlinium, and the Elder Magi have set Paido’s starguider to home in on the vibrations emitted by the spire. By following the direction of these vibrations, you should find the lost temple.</p>
<p>While Paido is busy adjusting the starguider, you decide to take a closer look at your surroundings.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to examine the red fruit, <a href="sect301.htm">turn to 301</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to examine the clear pool, <a href="sect2.htm">turn to 2</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to sit and wait for Paido to finish taking his readings, <a href="sect177.htm">turn to 177</a>.</p>
