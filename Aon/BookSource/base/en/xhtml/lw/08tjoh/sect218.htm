<h3>218</h3>

<p>The bargee hands you a tankard filled to the brim with Chai-cheer. Its greenish hue does little to inspire your confidence, but your doubts soon dissolve when you taste the beverage—it is delicious. Paido raises his tankard and takes a great mouthful of the ale of his choice—Ferina Nog. Immediately he spits it out, wiping away its insipid taste on the back of his hand. ‘Bilge juice!’ he splutters, slamming down his mug.</p>
<p>‘You should be a sight more careful where you empty your mouth, stranger,’ growls a man to your right. He bends down and picks up his polished steel helmet. With a slow and deliberate twist of his wrist he empties it of ale, pouring the contents all over Paido’s feet. Your companion curses and reaches instinctively for his sword.</p>
