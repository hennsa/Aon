<h3>232</h3>

<p>You hang your dripping Kai cloak over the back of an empty chair and draw it close to the blazing log fire. Your entrance has drawn curious glances from the tavern crowd and you can hear them speculating, in hushed voices, on the purpose of your visit. Paido removes his Backpack and hooded cape before joining you at a table. The whisperings increase as the plains folk catch sight of his dark skin and plaited, flaxen hair.</p>
<p>‘Pay no attention to them,’ advises the dwarf. ‘They’re a might suspicious folk an’ news of late’s done nought to better their nature.’ You nod benignly and assure the dwarf that they have nothing to fear from two travel-weary adventurers on their way north in search of work. Paido reaches for his pack and removes half a loaf of black bread and a slab of salted pork. He is about to offer you a share when a loud voice, full of indignation, rings in your ear. ‘And what do you think you’re up to?’</p>
<p>It is the voice of the cheerful dwarf, although the sight of you preparing to eat your own food in his tavern has greatly soured his mood. He strides across the floor and scatters Paido’s food with the back of his hand. ‘Get out!’ he bellows, his face growing redder by the second. ‘Get out before I throw you out!’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to gather your belongings and leave the tavern, <a href="sect294.htm">turn to 294</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to resist the innkeeper’s attempt at throwing you out into the storm, <a href="sect49.htm">turn to 49</a>.</p>
