<h3>26</h3>

<p>The dwarf’s face beams with pride as he prepares to talk on his favourite subject—himself. Nearly an hour later you have heard all there is to hear about the life and hopes of Lardin, son of Kardon of Bor.</p>
<p>‘What news have you of Luukos?’ asks Paido, as the dwarf takes a rare pause for breath.</p>
<p>‘News of a kind that’s becomin’ only too familiar round these parts,’ he replies in a disgruntled tone. ‘That Zegron’s bitten off more than he can chew this time. Once Lord Adamas an’ the army boys come down on ’im he’ll wish he’d stayed in his stinkin’ city of Xanar, you mark my words.’</p>
<p>‘Don’t be too sure o’ that, Lardin,’ says a rosy-faced farmer, who has sidled along the bar to join in your conversation. ‘My sister reckons that this time Zegron won’t stop till he’s flattened everything between Luukos and the Tentarias.’</p>
<p>‘That star-gazin’ sister o’ yours is full o’ good news. When ’as she ever seen anything cheerful with ’er telescopes an’ charts an’ crystal balls, eh? Answer me that.’ Agreement rumbles from the tavern crowd, now openly listening to the discussion.</p>
<p>‘That’s as maybe,’ retorts the farmer. ‘But when ’as she ever been wrong, eh?’ An uncomfortable silence fills the inn, and slowly the crowd return to their own business. None, least of all the innkeeper, chooses to pursue the matter further.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ask the farmer where his sister lives, <a href="sect262.htm">turn to 262</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to leave the tavern and continue your journey north to Tharro, <a href="sect318.htm">turn to 318</a>.</p>
