<h3>267</h3>

<p>Paido screams for your help. A swooping Kraan-rider has cast a large net, smothering his body. The net is sewn with hundreds of tiny barbed hooks which have worked their way into his skin and clothes, and he cannot free himself without the hooks inflicting fearful wounds. Only one Vordak remains to confront him, all the others having perished on his blade, but he is now unable to defend himself against this creature. He is at the mercy of a merciless foe.</p>
<p>You scramble to your feet and rush to save him as the Vordak creeps closer. Suddenly the Kraan-rider reappears, gliding low across the deck before hovering over the bow. A length of thin black rope dangles from its saddle and hurriedly the Vordak threads it through the corners of the net. You race up the steps, shouting ‘For Sommerlund’ and launch your attack. The Vordak turns to face you, its skeletal features frozen in a mask of terror. An instant later your weapon shears its bony neck and sends its skull-like head spinning down into the Danarg. A ghastly cry pierces your ears, but it is not a shriek of pain or despair: it is a malicious caw of triumph. The Kraan beats its massive wings, and the down-draught forces you to your knees as the creature climbs higher into the darkening sky. You stare aghast as the rope closes the net around Paido and lifts him off the deck. Instinctively you leap upwards, your hands outstretched to grab the barbed net, but it is too late. The Kraan turns in mid-air and flies off to the north with Paido, wounded and helpless, swinging like a netted fish below its leathery black belly.</p>
