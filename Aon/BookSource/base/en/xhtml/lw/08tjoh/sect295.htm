<h3>295</h3>

<p>Paido’s condition deteriorates rapidly. His coma deepens until finally his heart and brain simply cease to function and he dies. Sadness fills your senses, and in the lonely confines of the passage, you mourn the loss of your brave companion. But grief soon turns to anger as you remember the base trickery which ended his life, and so nearly put an end to yours.</p>
<p>A rage grows within you, fuelled by a need for revenge. You take Paido’s sword and vow to avenge his death by washing it in the blood of his murderers. Heedless of caution and the warning cry of your senses, you pull a lever which activates the secret pedestal lift and return to the hall above in search of vengeance.</p>
<p>As you reach the recess beneath the pulpit, you are transfixed by a blinding flash. A searing pain rips through your chest and a deafening <i>bang</i> rings in your ears. Three monks, armed with Bor muskets, have lain in wait in case you reappeared. It seems that their wait was not in vain.</p>
<p class="deadend">Your life and your quest end here.</p>
