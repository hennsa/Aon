<h3>321</h3>

<p>The rogue slumps dead at your feet. Seconds later the door to the back room splinters and breaks as Paido hacks through it with his sword.</p>
<p>‘What kept you so long?’ you ask cheekily, when finally the door gives way and he staggers, sweating and exhausted, into the room. He smiles ruefully and, after pausing to get his breath back, he invites you to come and see what he has found in the back room. Small sacks, each filled with nuggets of silver, are stacked in a huge mound that reaches almost to the ceiling.</p>
<p>‘No wonder he fought so desperately,’ you say, staring at this hoard of treasure. ‘There’s enough silver here to pay a king’s ransom.’</p>
<p>You may take some treasure before you leave—each Sack of Silver counts as one Backpack Item.</p>
