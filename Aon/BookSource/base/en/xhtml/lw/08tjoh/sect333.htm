<h3>333</h3>

<p>The slimy stench of the creature drives your horse wild with fear, forcing you to dismount and advance along the tree-bridge to meet it. Suddenly there is a fearful cry as your panic-stricken horse careers backwards into Paido’s mount. He fights to keep control of his own frightened horse but the panic is infectious and, with a crack of splintering wood, their stamping hooves split the edge of the tree-bridge. You watch with horror as both horses fall headlong into the watery abyss. Paido leaps from his mount as it falls, grabbing hold of the edge of the splintered wood, but it is wet and you can see his fingers slipping. Instinctively you move to save him, but the stinging lash of a clawed paw reminds you of the creature you must face first.</p>
<p class="combat">Anapheg: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 18   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 50</p>
<p>This creature is immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). Unless you have the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen, reduce your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 2 points for the duration of the combat, for the creature is also attacking you with the power of its mind.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect197.htm">turn to 197</a>.</p>
