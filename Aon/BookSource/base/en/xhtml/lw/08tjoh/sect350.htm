<h3>350</h3>

<p>Anger and frustration well up inside you as helplessly you watch the Kraan and your captured companion disappear beyond the horizon. Gradually your anger gives way to sadness as you ponder his fate and wonder if he will ever survive this cruel abduction. You pray for his safety, calling on the spirits of your ancestors to watch over and protect him and, as if in answer to your prayer, you feel a sudden calm engulf your senses. The power of the Lorestone, transfused into your being the instant it appeared in your hands, has greatly increased your intellect and awareness. With confidence you know that Paido will survive his ordeal and that one day you will meet and fight again, side by side.</p>
<p>The return voyage to Dessi is a swift but lonely journey. The starguider ensures that the Levitron stays on course for Elzian and as you cross the canal which encircles the city, a pilot skyship arrives to escort you down. During the voyage you have discovered how to control the Levitron, and now, as slowly you approach the landing platform of the Tower of Truth, you disengage the starguider and make a faultless landing. Lord Rimoah and the High Council have gathered to greet your return, and upon hearing of your successful quest their hopes for the future are renewed in spite of the sad news of Lord Paido’s capture by agents of the Darklords.</p>
<p>The High Council listens avidly as you recall your treacherous journey through Talestria, the perilous trek across the Danarg, and the wondrous discovery of their lost temple. When finally you have completed your account they applaud and pay tribute to your courage and daring, their faces beaming with pride. But, despite their joyous greeting, you sense that something is wrong; they seem distant, as if their minds were preoccupied with the solving of a difficult and perplexing problem.</p>
<p>You ask Lord Rimoah if all is well, and he replies: ‘You have grown in perception, Lone Wolf. Many things have occurred since last we spoke, and although your quest for the Lorestone of Ohrido has succeeded, the peril of our age has grown ever more deadly. The Darklords now wage open war throughout Magnamund, and many lands have fallen before their Giak legions. Talestria has been overrun. So too have the Stornland nations. Sommerlund stands firm against the armies of Darklord Gnaag, but she has lost her southern province of Ruanon.’</p>
<p>This shocking news fills you with an urge to return to your homeland, yet to do so would defeat the Magnakai quest.</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah bids you follow him to the chamber of the High Council. Set into the floor is a circular well, brimming with a silvery liquid metal. Rimoah kneels and touches the surface and slowly a vision takes form within the shimmering depths of the pool: it is a fortified city surrounded by rolling hills. ‘You look upon the city of Tahou in the land of Anari,’ says Rimoah, his voice now solemn and composed. ‘The Lorestone you must find next lies deep below its streets, in an ancient city that was built during the dawn of Magnamund.’</p>
<p>The vision of Tahou heralds the start of a new and perilous episode in your quest for the Magnakai. If you possess the bravery and courage of a true Kai Master, the challenge of Tahou awaits you in Book 9 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series entitled:</p>
