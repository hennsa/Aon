<h3>42</h3>

<p>‘I am Tadia the Prophetess,’ she says, her voice soft and lilting, ‘and you are Lone Wolf, Lord of the Sun-realm, <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn,</i> of legend.’ Paido reaches for his sword but you stay his hand, for you sense that this woman wishes to help, not harm you.</p>
<p>‘We live in an age of great peril. Your enemies of old are our enemies; they stand poised to conquer our land and I fear we are too weak to resist them. Your purpose is known to me, and I will aid you all I can in the hope that you will fulfil your destiny and destroy the champions of darkness.’</p>
<p>Tadia raises her arms and points towards the sky. Floating in the air between her parted hands appears a spinning globe of white fire. She tilts back her head and stares into this ball of flame, her eyes unblinking despite the fearful intensity of the light. ‘Your safest passage to the Danarg is through the Mordril Forest,’ she says solemnly. ‘The road to Syada is fraught with danger—only battle and death await you there.’</p>
<p>The globe flickers and fades and Tadia returns her gaze to you. ‘Let nothing delay your quest, Lone Wolf. The future of both our lands depends on your success.’</p>
<p>Before you leave the prophetess offers you a choice of potions and weapons. You may take whatever you wish but remember to amend your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly. Choose from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potion of Alether—increases <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 2 points for the duration of a single combat.</li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur—restores 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (enough for one dose).</li>
<li>Broadsword</li>
<li>Quarterstaff</li>
<li>Rendalim’s Elixir—restores 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (enough for one dose).</li>
<li>Tincture of Oxydine—restores 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (enough for one dose).</li>
</ul>
<p>All potions are Backpack Items. If you are infected with the korovax bacillus, you may use the Tincture of Oxydine to cure yourself.</p>
<p>Once you have made your choice you leave the Ferry House and continue.</p>
