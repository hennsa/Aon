<h3>64</h3>

<p>Seconds later you hear the crash of broken furniture as a fight breaks out inside the cabin. Paido has surprised your would-be assailant, and the two of them are now locked in hand-to-hand combat. Abruptly the noise ceases, and Paido appears at the front door, sweating and dishevelled, his sword bloodied in his hand.</p>
<p>‘Where have you been?’ he asks, stepping aside to allow you to enter. A scar-faced man lies dead on the floor, a wooden stave lying across his chest. ‘Come and see what I’ve found in the back room,’ says Paido, leading the way.</p>
<p>Small sacks, each filled with nuggets of silver, are stacked in a huge mound that reaches almost to the ceiling. ‘No wonder he fought so desperately,’ you say, staring at this treasure hoard. ‘There’s enough silver here to pay a king’s ransom.’</p>
<p>You may take some treasure before you leave—each Sack of Silver counts as one Backpack Item.</p>
