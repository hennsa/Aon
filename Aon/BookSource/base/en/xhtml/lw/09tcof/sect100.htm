<h3>100</h3>

<p>Tahou, an ancient stronghold containing a vast city, is a formidable and wondrous sight in the moonlight, the imposing walls and towers of red stone and grey rock assume the softening sheen of velvet, and the city is often referred to as ‘The velvet fortress’. Beyond the towers and high curtain wall you can see a thousand spires and minarets, grouped as thickly as the trees of a forest. Tiny lights twinkle in countless windows and portals, adding to the splendour of the mighty capital.</p>
<p>Near to the city’s South Gate, the highway is flanked by beacons which illuminate those who approach the gatehouse. A drawbridge spans a moat of black water and, as you ride across, a bell tolls from the portcullised archway ahead.</p>
<p>‘Two civilian riders at the South Gate,’ yells a soldierly voice.</p>
<p>‘Raise the postern,’ shouts another.</p>
<p>There is a clatter of chains and a scraping of stone. You watch the portcullis, expecting it to rise, but it does not move, Instead, a narrow portal opens at the base of the wall and an armoured guard steps from the shadows. He motions you to enter and you follow Banedon along a corridor of stone, leading to a secure enclosure. You glance upwards to see the faces of a dozen soldiers, peering down at you from behind a parapet that encircles the high enclosure walls. All of them grasp loaded crossbows which they train on you as you move. Then a small gate creaks open and two guards appear, armed with broad-bladed spears.</p>
<p>‘Who are you?’ one demands in a gruff tone. ‘Why do you seek entry to Tahou?’</p>
<p class="choice">If you have an Invitation and wish to show it, <a href="sect321.htm">turn to 321</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to tell the guards that you have come to offer your services in the defence of the city, <a href="sect196.htm">turn to 196</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to say that you intend to enter the Tahou Cauldron, <a href="sect60.htm">turn to 60</a>.</p>
