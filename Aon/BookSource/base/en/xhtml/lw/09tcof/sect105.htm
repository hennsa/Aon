<h3>105</h3>

<p>Gwynian dispatches a messenger to the Anarium, the House of the Senate, where members of the governing council have gathered for an emergency assembly called by the President himself. Within the hour, the messenger returns with a furled parchment bearing the presidential seal. ‘He has agreed to hear your plea, Lone Wolf,’ says Gwynian, his eyes scanning the official reply. This news raises your flagging spirits but the sage seems a little disappointed.</p>
<p>‘I was hoping for a private audience with the President,’ he says, ‘but in view of the current crisis, I suppose it is the best we can expect. You must appear before the Senate this evening, and state your reasons for wishing to enter the Tahou Cauldron. They will consider your request and vote accordingly. Their decision will be final.’</p>
<p>He hands you the scroll and arranges for his personal carriage to take you to the Anarium. As you climb aboard and sink into the plush, upholstered seat, you exchange a farewell wave with Gwynian the Sage. ‘May the gods watch over you,’ he says, ‘and may you live to fulfil your destiny.’</p>
