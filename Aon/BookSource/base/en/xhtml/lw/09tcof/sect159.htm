<h3>159</h3>

<p>You focus your improved Kai Mastery at the flames that engulf the top of the staircase. Within a few seconds they flicker and die, allowing you to reach the first floor in safety. The captain is crouched over his brother, protecting him with his body from the fiery debris that is raining down from the roof. Swiftly you pull him to his feet and motion him to help carry his wounded brother out of the house. As you reach the street below, the roof collapses and the whole of the first floor is swallowed by flame.</p>
<p>‘We owe you our lives,’ says the captain, gratefully, as his men load his brother onto an open-backed wagon. ‘I must return to my command at the North Gate—will you join me? I would be honoured to fight by your side.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go with the captain to the North Gate, <a href="sect108.htm">turn to 108</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to decline his offer, you continue along the street towards the West Gate; <a href="sect179.htm">turn to 179</a>.</p>
