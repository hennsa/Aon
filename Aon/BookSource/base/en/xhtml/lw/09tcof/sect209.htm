<h3>209</h3>

<p>Banedon rides alongside the crowded wagon and talks with Lortha as the procession continues on its way to Navasari. After a few minutes’ conversation she hands him a scrap of parchment, and they bid each other farewell.</p>
<p>‘They are the last of the evacuees,’ he says, as you continue your ride north. ‘They expect the enemy to reach Tahou in two days’ time. They’ve already seen Giak scouts and early this morning a squadron of Kraan were sighted high in the western skies. She advises us to steer clear of a village called Sidara. It’s rumoured to have already fallen to the enemy. She also gave me this … ’</p>
<p>Banedon hands you the scrap of parchment. It contains a few lines of Anarian script, an address, and a signature. ‘It’s an invitation to stay at Chiban and Lortha’s house in Tahou. It may be useful when we reach the city gate.’</p>
<p>Mark this Invitation on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item that you keep in your pocket. If you already carry the maximum number of Special Items, you must discard one in favour of this new item.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue your journey north, <a href="sect274.htm">turn to 274</a>.</p>
