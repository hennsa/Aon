<h3>268</h3>

<p>Guyuk is a nervous and jittery sort of man. He is afflicted with all manner of tics and twitches and is given to worrying about anything and everything. Recently his condition has worsened, and in light of events in the north, it is not difficult to understand why.</p>
<p>‘Oh! What’s to become of us? Where will it all end?’ he mutters, wringing his pudgy hands and casting his eyes to the rafters. ‘Every day for the last two weeks wagons filled with women and children have been leaving Tahou for the south, yet the Senate tell us that nothing is wrong, that we should go about our business and not concern ourselves with city affairs. Well, I for one am not fooled. I tell you they’re keeping us in the dark about what’s really happening and I’m not going to wait around to suffer the consequences. I’m closing up and moving out at the end of the week, and if you two gentlemen would take some friendly advice, you’d be wise to do the same.’</p>
<p>Someone in the tavern is calling for more lovka. Before you can question Guyuk further, he snatches up a bottle and scurries away to serve his thirsty customer.</p>
