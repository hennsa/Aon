<h3>292</h3>

<p>The men are plainly displeased that you have interrupted their conversation. One of them, a sallow-faced knave with dark eyes and curly black hair, snatches a jug from the table and takes a long swig. He slams it down and turns to his friend.</p>
<p>‘Did you know,’ he says, red wine squirting through his rotted teeth, ‘my brother Ghane was killed in Ragadorn last year? He was stabbed in the back by a lousy Northlander.’ Slowly he turns his head and stares coldly into your eyes. ‘I hate Northlanders,’ he snarls. ‘They’re all cowardly, backstabbing scum!’ You notice his hand leave the jug and slip below the table.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to tell him you are sorry to hear what happened to his brother, <a href="sect8.htm">turn to 8</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to prepare for combat in case he attacks you, <a href="sect86.htm">turn to 86</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide it would be wise to leave the eating house, <a href="sect347.htm">turn to 347</a>.</p>
