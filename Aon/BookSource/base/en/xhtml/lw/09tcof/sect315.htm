<h3>315</h3>

<p>‘Find somewhere else to sit, stranger: that place is mine,’ he demands, grasping the hilt of his dagger with his free hand. You sense movement outside in the street and you glance nervously at the cellar door. ‘Get up,’ growls the man impatiently, drawing his dagger slowly from its sheath. ‘If you dare cross Sogh of Suentina, you’ll not live long enough to regret it!’</p>
<p>At that instant the door bursts open and in rush six heavily armed Senate House guards. Thinking that the ale cellar is being raided, something of a routine event here at the Purple Purse, the shady patrons drop their drinks and flee towards the open door in an attempt to escape arrest. Sogh, the thief who threatened you, heads towards a shadowy arch. You run after him and grab him by the arm.</p>
<p>‘Get me out of here,’ you plead, ‘you can name your price.’ The wily thief smiles at the thought of making some easy money and holds out his hand.</p>
<p>‘Give me your money pouch and I’ll save your skin.’ Grudgingly you hand over your gold and follow the thief into the archway. Delete any Gold Crowns or Lune you have recorded in the Belt Pouch section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
