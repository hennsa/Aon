<h3>321</h3>

<p>The guards inspect the Invitation, their expressions conveying their doubt that the signature it bears is genuine. They order you to dismount and one of them hurries off to summon the gatehouse commander. Fortunately, when he arrives he recognizes Lortha’s mark and allows you to leave the enclosure, although he impounds both your horses. You protest and demand that they be returned, but to no avail.</p>
<p>‘Orders of the Senate,’ says the commander, offhandedly; ‘an emergency decree. All horses belonging to the civil population must be delivered into the care of the garrison stables until the state of emergency is lifted.’</p>
<p>Reluctantly you allow the guards to take your steeds and, as they are being led away, the commander hands you each a piece of vellum stamped with a date and a number. ‘Receipts,’ he explains, his tone noticeably more friendly. You pocket your Receipt (mark this as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>; owing to its size, you need not delete another Special Item should you already carry the maximum quota) and are about to walk away when he calls out, ‘Report to the citadel first thing in the morning. You’ll be allocated your battle positions for when the enemy attack.’</p>
