<h3>77</h3>

<p>You detect that these creatures have the ability to communicate telepathically, although it is one of their less developed skills. Their leader appears to be a female; she is taller and lighter in colour than the rest. You take the risk of calling to her telepathically, and she responds by turning to face you. When her companions see what has attracted her attention, they shriek with fear and scurry down the stairs, carrying with them the egg, which they cradle protectively in their webbed hands. But she remains and speaks to you with her mind. <i>You are unlike the other man-things that have ventured into our domain. What is it that you seek? Care you not what happens to those of your kind who trespass here?</i> The reptilian points to the far end of the hall, where a group of ghouls are huddled in the shadows. Your skin creeps as you realize they were once men like you.</p>
<p>‘I seek the Lorestone,’ you reply, boldly. ‘I am the Kai Lord Lone Wolf and I quest for the wisdom of Nyxator that I may vanquish the spawn of his enemies and save my people from destruction.’</p>
<p>Her harsh gaze softens as your proud words fill her mind. You sense a sadness within her, but she replies with words of joy. <i>Your quest will be fulfilled, as it was by your sire many centuries ago. We have waited long for your coming, <i xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</i>, and we will fulfil our duty to Him who gave us life.</i></p>
<p>Without an outward sign she beckons you to follow her, and you comply without hesitation.</p>
