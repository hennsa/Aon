<h3>Improved Disciplines</h3>

<p>As you rise through the higher levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will steadily improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills), Tutelary (five skills), Principalin (six skills), or Mentora (seven skills), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>
<h4><a name="primate">Primate</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Primates with this Magnakai Discipline are able to repel an animal that is intent on harming them by blocking its sense of taste and smell. The level of success is dependent on the size and ferocity of the animal.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have the ability to delay the effects of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison he is able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and are able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Primates with the skill of Nexus will be able to offer a far greater resistance than before to the effects of noxious gases and fumes.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="tutelary">Tutelary</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to use defensive combat skills to great effect when fighting unarmed. When entering combat without a weapon, Tutelaries lose only 2 points from their <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, instead of the usual 4 points.</dd>
<dt>Invisibility</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries are able to increase the effectiveness of their skill when hiding from an enemy by drawing the enemy’s attention to a place other than that in which they are hiding. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill can detect an enemy ambush within 500 yards of their position unless their <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score is low due to wounds sustained or lack of food.</dd>
<dt>Psi-screen</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries with this skill develop mental defences against magical charms and hostile telepathy. These defences increase in strength as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Divination</dt>
<dd>Tutelaries who possess this Magnakai Discipline are able to recognize objects or creatures with magical skills or abilities. However, this improved Discipline can be negated if the creature or object is shielded from detection.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="prncpln">Principalin</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Animal Control</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this skill are able to call on a woodland animal (if nearby) to aid them, either in combat, or to act as a messenger or guide. The number of animals that can be summoned increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Invisibility</dt>
<dd>Principalins are able to mask any sounds made by their movements while using this skill.</dd>
<dt>Huntmastery</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this Magnakai Discipline are able to intensify their eyesight at will, giving them telescopic vision.</dd>
<dt>Psi-surge</dt>
<dd>Principalins using this skill in combat are able to confuse an enemy by planting seeds of doubt in its mind. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Nexus</dt>
<dd>Principalins with this ability can extinguish fires by force of will alone. The size of the fire, and the number that can be extinguished using Nexus increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="mentora">Mentora</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weaponmastery</dt>
<dd>Mentoras skilled in Weaponmastery are more accurate when using all missile weapons, whether fired (e.g. a bow) or thrown (e.g. a dagger). When using a bow or thrown weapon and instructed to pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>, add 2 to the number picked if you are a Mentora with the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery.</dd>
<dt>Curing</dt>
<dd>Mentoras with this skill are able to neutralize the effects of any poisons, venoms, or toxins with which they come into contact.</dd>
<dt>Pathsmanship</dt>
<dd>Mentoras who possess this Magnakai Discipline are able to cross any kind of terrain on foot without leaving any tracks, even if the ground is covered in snow.</dd>
<dt>Psi-screen</dt>
<dd>Mentoras with this ability can protect themselves from evil spirits and other non-corporeal beings that attack with psychic energy. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
<dt>Divination</dt>
<dd>Mentoras who possess this skill are able to detect psychic residues lingering in a place where a dramatic event, such as a battle, a murder, a ritual sacrifice, or a ritual ceremony, has taken place. By meditating at the scene of the incident, a Kai Mentora is able to visualize the event, even though it may have occurred in the distant past.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The nature of any additional improvements and how they affect your Magnakai Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Disciplines section of future Lone Wolf books.</p>
