<h3>223</h3>

<p>‘Identify yourself!’ you shout in reply. ‘Then maybe you’ll hear some news that’ll cheer your heart.’ Slowly the man steps out from behind the boulders. He raises his hand and twenty others, maybe more, appear around the lip of the gorge. Several are armed with loaded bows, all pointed at you. The men are dressed in jerkins and breeches of crimson leather, and each carries a veritable arsenal of weapons strapped about his waist and chest. They are Eruan partisans.</p>
<p>‘I come from the court of Prince Graygor,’ you say, your voice amplified by the natural acoustics of the gorge. ‘The army of Eru and the Lencian allies have driven the enemy back to Cetza. Battle is imminent and victory will soon be ours.’</p>
<p>‘Your news is stale to our ears,’ comes the reply. ‘And the Prince would not send a Pathfinder to tell us such as this.’ The partisans shuffle uneasily and view you with renewed suspicion. ‘It is not my purpose to bring news of the war. I come to entreat the aid of Sebb Jarel,’ you reply.</p>
<p>The spokesman for the partisans signals to the others and a section disappears from view. They reappear on horseback at the mouth of the gorge and beckon you to approach them.</p>
