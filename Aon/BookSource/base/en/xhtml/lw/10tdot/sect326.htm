<h3>326</h3>

<p>You snatch the amulet from Roark’s lifeless hand and then turn to confront Tagazin. You sense an energy flowing between Roark’s amulet and the amulet that hangs around the Demonlord’s neck, and you use this power-bridge to ward off the creature.</p>
<p>Tagazin shudders as your psychic commands rob him of his supernatural strength. His body becomes pale, almost transparent, and wisps of smoke curl from his skin as though his body were evaporating slowly. He retreats towards the centre of the temple and leaps onto the marble block. There is a chilling howl and suddenly the shadowy chamber is flooded with a blinding light. Thunder booms and the walls shake. Terrified, Roark’s followers flee the temple and scramble up the stairs. Crackling bolts of white lightning leap from the marble block to tear great chunks of rock from the walls, and the air seethes with a cloying stench that threatens to suffocate you. With terror in your heart you bound up the steps and escape as the defeated spirit of the Demonlord vents its spite on the chamber below.</p>
