<h3>333</h3>

<p>With one swipe of his huge white paw, he hooks his claws into your tunic and flings you across the temple. Shocked by his speed and ferocity, you scramble to your feet and fumble for a hand weapon as he stalks after you like a cat teasing a frightened mouse. His face is set in a ghastly sneer as he enjoys the novelty of his mortal form.</p>
<p>Around his neck, on a chain of black iron, hangs an amulet forged in the shape of a fiery, five-pointed star. You notice that Roark possesses a similar amulet which he clutches to his chest as if his very life depended on it. He and his followers are huddled in a corner of the temple, watching you and their master fearfully.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the Demonlord with your weapon, <a href="sect210.htm">turn to 210</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to cut the amulet from his neck, <a href="sect128.htm">turn to 128</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack Roark and take the amulet he is holding, <a href="sect41.htm">turn to 41</a>.</p>
