<h3>42</h3>

<p>‘By the gods! What manner of black sorcery is this?’ gasps Prince Graygor, horrified by the cruel slaughter. But his horror is soon overcome by the sudden realization that he must act swiftly to counter this threat or the battle might be lost. The Lencian knights are being held up at the bridge and every minute that passes costs them dearly.</p>
<p>He calls for his destrier, a magnificent white charger clad in ornate plate armour, and climbs into the saddle. ‘To battle!’ he shouts, and, ignoring the warnings of his heralds, he spurs his warhorse down the hill. The knights of the Palace Guard give a rousing cheer as he takes his place at the head of their column and leads them towards the ruined temple.</p>

<p class="choice">If you choose to stay where you are and observe the battle, <a href="sect163.htm">turn to 163</a>.</p>
