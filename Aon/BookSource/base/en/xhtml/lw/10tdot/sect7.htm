<h3>7</h3>

<p>The captain grunts his approval and returns your salute. Then he catches sight of your signet ring and suddenly his mood becomes much more friendly. He orders the townsfolk to lower their pistols and return to their homes and begrudgingly they obey his command. ‘Come,’ he says, placing his hand on your shoulder. ‘You must be thirsty after your day’s ride.’</p>
<p>He pushes open the tavern door and draws aside a tattered leather curtain. A dozen pairs of eyes look towards you as you enter, stare briefly, and then return to their own business.</p>
<p>‘I see you come to Pirsi with the Prince’s favour,’ says the captain, casting a glance at the ring you wear as you raise the tankard of ale he places before you. ‘What news do you bring from the Royal Court?’</p>
<p>‘I’m here on a mission, a secret mission of great importance,’ you reply, guardedly. ‘I must speak with Sebb Jarel, for only he can help me accomplish the task. I am at liberty to say no more.’</p>
<p>The captain looks at you quizzically. ‘It’s unlike Prince Graygor to entrust such responsibility to one of your rank, soldier. If you expect me to take you to Jarel you have first to satisfy me that you’re a Pathfinder. That bandit Baron Shinzar has sent men to find Jarel before—on missions of assassination. I want proof you’re not another one of his agents.’</p>
<p>He peers over your shoulder towards the tavern bar and signals to the owner by blinking three times. The metallic <i>click</i> of a crossbow being cocked and your Kai Sixth Sense alert you to the weapon that is now pointed at your back. ‘Tell me, soldier, where were you trained as a Pathfinder? Was it in Humbold, in Sharwhan, or in Testla?’</p>
<p class="choice">If you have completed the Lore-circle of the Spirit, <a href="sect46.htm">turn to 46</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have mastery of this Lore-circle you must hazard a guess at the answer.</p>
<p class="choice">If you answer, ‘Humbold’, <a href="sect111.htm">turn to 111</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you answer, ‘Sharwhan’, <a href="sect287.htm">turn to 287</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you answer, ‘Testla’, <a href="sect152.htm">turn to 152</a>.</p>
