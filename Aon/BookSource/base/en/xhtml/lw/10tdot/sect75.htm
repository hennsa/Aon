<h3>75</h3>

<p>The road beyond the river takes you into thick forest and a dense canopy of branches arches overhead. A dazzling mosaic of light and shade blankets the trail as it winds like a tunnel through the tall, grey-green trees. Gradually the trail becomes rougher: new saplings have speared through the stony surface and foliage spills out from the forest on either side. The tunnel ends abruptly at the edge of a steep valley, although the trail itself continues, winding its way down towards a fast-flowing stream.</p>
<p>Cautiously you urge your horse down the twisting path to arrive at a cluster of dilapidated log huts. Rust and rot have taken their toll but you can still discern the remains of what was once a mining settlement where men panned for gold. A wooden sign hangs lopsided above an open door, swinging slightly in the breeze. Its paint is cracked and the panel bears fresh sword scars, but you can still make out the words: it reads, ‘Kaig Settlement’.</p>
<p>Two trails lead away from this abandoned mining village. One climbs out of the valley and disappears into the forest; the other follows the stream towards its source among the snow-capped mountains of the Eru Range.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, <a href="sect102.htm">turn to 102</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take the trail that climbs out of the valley, <a href="sect313.htm">turn to 313</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ride along the track beside the stream, <a href="sect18.htm">turn to 18</a>.</p>
