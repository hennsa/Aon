<h2>Magnakai Wisdom</h2>

<p>Your visit to the twilight world of the Daziarn will be fraught with supernatural dangers. As you search for the two remaining Lorestones be on your guard at all times, for here even the laws of nature are strange and unstable. Make notes as you progress through this story for they will be of great help, both in this quest and in the ultimate Magnakai adventure which follows it.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will help you during your mission. Some Special Items will be of use in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep. If this is your first Magnakai adventure be sure to choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.<sup><a href="#kaiwisdm-1-foot" name="kaiwisdm-1">4</a></sup></p>
<p> The future of Magnamund and the restoration of your warrior élite depend on the success of your Daziarn quest. May the spirit of your ancestors and the wisdom of the great God Kai guide your journey along the path of the Magnakai.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>[<a name="kaiwisdm-1-foot" href="#kaiwisdm-1">4</a>] Due to several unavoidable, difficult combats in this book, it is practically impossible for a new or average character to complete this adventure successfully. Even a character with optimal choices of equipment and Disciplines and the highest possible scores for <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> will have a difficult time with this adventure.</p></div>
