<h3>198</h3>

<p>You have removed your Backpack and are undoing the buckles when two hairy, clawed paws reach up, hook themselves into the soles of your boots, and drag you down. The sudden jolt makes you drop your pack into the river (delete your Backpack as well as its contents, including Meals, from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. You may not acquire any Backpack Items until your Backpack has been replaced) and leaves you clinging to the beam with one hand, while trying desperately to free a weapon with the other. Your attacker—a huge, misshapen beast banded in black and brown fur—lunges repeatedly with its head as it tries to sink its fangs into your thigh.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, add 3 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 4 or more, <a href="sect128.htm">turn to 128</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is now 3 or less, <a href="sect214.htm">turn to 214</a>.</p>
