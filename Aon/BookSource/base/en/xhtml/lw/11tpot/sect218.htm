<h3>218</h3>

<p>You whisper a warning to your guide; then simultaneously you dive for cover behind the same tree, out of the creature’s line of fire. Odel rolls over and sits with his back to the trunk while he sets the metal crossbow that is strapped to his forearm. As soon as he is ready, you leap across the gap to another tree in the hope of drawing the creature’s fire. Your ploy works: the sniper fires his blowpipe at your fleeting form, missing you by a wide mark, and Odel is able to pinpoint his position. He points and fires, sending his bronze bolt deep into the scaly abdomen of an Agtah sniper—your would-be assassin. The creature gives a piercing shriek and tumbles to the ground, landing with a sickening thud near the uprooted base of Baylon’s Bough.</p>
<p>You compliment Odel on his bow-skill and rush forward, half-crouched, to search the Chaos-creature’s body.</p>
