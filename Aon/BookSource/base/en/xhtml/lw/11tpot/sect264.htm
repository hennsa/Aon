<h3>264</h3>

<p>You wake with a start, stirred to consciousness by the distant flap of large wings beating in a windless sky. The sounds grow louder and quickly you gather up your equipment and hurry out of the cavern to investigate their source.</p>
<p>The storm died down while you slept and the plateau is now becalmed. From the rim of the gully you can see six black shapes silhouetted on the blazing horizon. They resemble dragons with snaky necks and ragged bat-like wings. Upon their backs they carry gold-skinned creatures, human in appearance save for their lack of hair and their massive size.</p>
<p>The leader sees you: he banks his dragonmount towards the gully and the others follow closely in his wake. You fear they are about to attack, but at the last moment they veer away and circle the gully before landing nearby. With practised ease the leader and two of his brothers dismount from their winged steeds. They each dwarf you by an arm’s length, and, although their heavy muscular bodies seem incapable of stealth, they approach like lions stalking their prey. <i xml:lang="x-unknown">‘Zeeu klo-ka n’ra?’</i> speaks the leader, his voice deep and resonant. <i xml:lang="x-unknown">‘Ryl’aan noorna?’</i> says another, impatiently.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship and have attained the Kai rank of Scion-kai, <a href="sect305.htm">turn to 305</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this Magnakai Discipline or have yet to reach this level of training, <a href="sect132.htm">turn to 132</a>.</p>
