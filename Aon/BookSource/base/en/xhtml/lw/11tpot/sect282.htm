<h3>282</h3>

<p>The two Ookor scurry across the planks and you follow closely on their heels, running half-crouched to make use of the cover afforded by the parapet of the bridge. You reach the centre of the bridge and are relieved to see that the damage is not beyond repair; whoever did this wanted to delay not destroy. T’uk T’ron signals to his guards to come and lend a hand with the repairs, but as soon as they leave the chariots a chilling howl echoes from the nearby trees. ‘Agtah!’ moans T’uk T’ron, his voice a whisper of fear. ‘Creatures of chaos!’</p>
<p>A shiver runs down your spine when you see them. Lumbering hordes of twisted shapes lurch from the trees on either side of the bridge and stagger drunkenly towards the chariots. They appear to be neither animal nor human but a ghastly fusion of the two. Now only two drivers remain with the onipa teams and T’uk T’ron is quick to see the danger. He commands the guards to return and leads them back across the bridge with his crystal sword held high.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to follow T’uk T’ron and help him defend the chariots, <a href="sect273.htm">turn to 273</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to stay where you are and attempt to repair the bridge, <a href="sect176.htm">turn to 176</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to abandon the Ookor and escape across the bridge on foot, <a href="sect10.htm">turn to 10</a>.</p>
