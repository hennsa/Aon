<h3>70</h3>

<p>The stairs lead to a passageway, which gives access to a street via hinged stone portals in the ceiling. You climb through one of the portals to emerge on a gloomy street corner.</p>
<p>Few walk the shadowy avenues of Haagadar: the atmosphere is so thick with the smell of salt and sulphur that those whom you do pass are unrecognizable behind the damp pads they press to their faces to ward off the cloying stench. The dimly lit street ends at a central square, where you witness two encouraging sights. Roped to a stone monolith at the centre of the square is a huge, black bird—the scarlet warrior’s winged steed. Behind it, rising in flat-topped tiers is the Temple of the Sandai. Two armour-clad creatures stand guard at the entrance, their rusty helmets crudely adapted to hold their face pads in position. You sense that the Lorestone is here, within the temple, and you scan every inch of it in the hope of finding an unguarded entrance. There are no other doors, but a circular, chimney-like vent protrudes from the middle of the highest tier.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to climb to the top of the temple and attempt to enter through the vent, <a href="sect217.htm">turn to 217</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to cover your face and attempt to bluff your way past the guards, <a href="sect38.htm">turn to 38</a>.</p>
