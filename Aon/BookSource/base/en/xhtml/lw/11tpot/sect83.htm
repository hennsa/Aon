<h3>83</h3>

<p>Drawing upon your psychic ability you commit yourself to a state of deep trance in which you are able to separate your spirit from your living body and step beyond your physical form. As if in a dream you move by the power of your will alone. Your astral body is naked and, although it seems no different in shape, it feels eerily light, translucent and impalpable. With total fascination you stare at your mortal form, seeing yourself for the first time as others see you.</p>
<p>Your surroundings are the same but all sense of limitation is gone. You approach the door and thrust your hand against it but you encounter no obstruction. Your hand passes effortlessly through the platinum and into the corridor beyond. Intoxicated by your newfound power you venture further and explore the watchtower, its corridors, stairs, and chambers, but discover little that can aid your physical escape. There is only one exit from the tower and it is watched by more than a dozen heavily armed Yoacor guards. You are about to pass through them and continue out into the city itself when you feel your strength weakening: the time has come to rejoin your physical body. Quickly you return to the tower room, while you have power enough to spirit walk, and re-enter your mortal self.</p>
<p>Your two bodies reunited, you are able to wake from your trance. You feel strangely cold and tired (lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points) but you remember vividly every detail of your psychic experience.</p>
