<h2>Footnotes</h2>


<div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="equipmnt.htm#equipmnt-1">1</a>]  (<a href="equipmnt.htm">Equipment</a>) The Lantern is designed to be self-lighting. You will not need a Tinderbox or any other means of creating a flame to light it.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect35.htm#sect35-1">2</a>]  (<a href="sect35.htm">Section 35</a>) After much deliberation, we have here altered the Xargath’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score from 10 to 100, in line with <a href="sect192.htm">Section 192</a>. The massive difference in the Xargath’s <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> here can be attributed to the fact that you’re sitting just behind its head which is stuck in the deck, instead of standing on the deck in front of it. However, the original <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> value seems pitifully low to the extent that the combat is a foregone conclusion, even for a new character with only 3 Magnakai Disciplines and the lowest unmodified values for <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Additionally, the presented option to evade combat seems to indicate that the fight should be at least moderately challenging.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect75.htm#sect75-1">3</a>]  (<a href="sect75.htm">Section 75</a>) <cite>Lone Wolf Club Newsletter No.12</cite> clarifies: ‘Although the Sommerswerd has been drawn and used within the Darklands, you were able to use it to destroy Kraagenskûl before he could make use of the communicator to inform Gnaag of your presence. The port of Argazad is on the fringe of the Darklands and, because of its remote location, your unsheathing of the Sommerswerd did not directly alert Gnaag in Helgedad. The Sommerswerd combat with Kraagenskûl was true to Rimoah’s warning (<a href="sect282.htm">Section 282</a>); it did alert him to your presence and betrayed your true identity.’</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect75.htm#sect75-2">4</a>]  (<a href="sect75.htm">Section 75</a>) Unless you are carrying the Dagger of Vashna and choose to use it, you will be unable to inflict damage upon Darklord Kraagenskûl for the three rounds until you can retrieve the Sommerswerd. Should you choose to use the Dagger of Vashna here, remember that ‘you may add 7 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of the fight, owing to the power of the Dagger of Vashna when used against a Darklord of Helgedad’ (cf. <a href="sect171.htm">Section 171</a>).</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect79.htm#sect79-1">5</a>]  (<a href="sect79.htm">Section 79</a>) Given the description of this armour which makes it seem to be lightweight (note that there is no <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> bonus for wearing it), it seems reasonable that it can be worn over other forms of armour.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect220.htm#sect220-1">6</a>]  (<a href="sect220.htm">Section 220</a>) This section is unreachable. To get here, you have to be an Archmaster with Nexus, which means you have all but one Discipline. However, the only route here is <a href="sect150.htm">Section 150</a> to <a href="sect80.htm">Section 80</a> to <a href="sect249.htm">Section 249</a> to <a href="sect67.htm">Section 67</a> to <a href="sect121.htm">Section 121</a> to Section 220. <a href="sect249.htm">Section 249</a> is only reachable if you <em>don’t</em> have Huntmastery at Archmaster level, and <a href="sect67.htm">Section 67</a> is only reachable if you <em>don’t</em> have Pathsmanship at Tutelary level. So to arrive here, you must be an Archmaster who has neither Huntmastery nor Pathsmanship. This oversight on the part of the author cannot easily be fixed.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect230.htm#sect230-1">7</a>]  (<a href="sect230.htm">Section 230</a>) Remember to add 7 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of the combat due to the power of your weapon against a Darklord of Helgedad. Information revealed in a later section may have an effect on how this fight should be conducted; see the <a href="errata.htm#err230">erratum for this section</a> for details. Note that this will reveal certain information to you sooner than the author intended, which many readers, especially first-time readers, may prefer not to know.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect240.htm#sect240-1">8</a>]  (<a href="sect240.htm">Section 240</a>) It is possible that your permanent <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score might fall to zero or below due to the evil power of Helshezag, but you may be wearing a piece of armour that gives you an <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point bonus. This would leave you with a permanent <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score of 0 with a current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score still above zero. If your basic <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score is reduced to zero or below, you are dead and your adventure is over.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p>[<a href="sect268.htm#sect268-1">9</a>]  (<a href="sect268.htm">Section 268</a>) It is possible that your permanent <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score might fall to zero or below due to the Sea-scavenger’s attack, but you may be wearing a piece of armour that gives you an <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point bonus. This would leave you with a permanent <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score of 0 with a current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score still above zero. If your basic <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score is reduced to zero or below, you are dead and your adventure is over.</p></div>
