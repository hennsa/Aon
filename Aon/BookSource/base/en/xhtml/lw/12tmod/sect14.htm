<h3>14</h3>

<p>The tide bears you swiftly towards a shingle beach, which is littered with huge, sea-smoothed boulders. The hissing surf and the screech of the loathsome sea-scavengers echo all along this barren coastline. It is an unwelcoming sound—cold and hostile—a fitting reflection of the land itself.</p>
<p>Ten yards from the stony beach you slip into the thigh-deep foam and wade ashore. Night has fallen swiftly, but there is a full moon by which to see. It pierces the darkness and bathes the landscape in its ghostly ashen light. Crouching low, you scurry up the beach, using the boulders as cover as you head towards the base of a sheer cliff wall. You are nearing your goal when the sounds of footsteps and gruff voices stop you dead in your tracks: it is a patrol of Giak soldiers. Drawn from their cliff-top encampment, having witnessed the battle at sea, they are searching the water’s edge for survivors. The tips of their spears glint wetly crimson in the moonlight, alerting you to the fate that has befallen those of Davan’s crew who managed to swim ashore.</p>
<p><i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Ok zee orgadak!’</i> growls one of the leading scouts, pointing in your direction.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Invisibility and have reached the Kai rank of Tutelary or higher, <a href="sect215.htm">turn to 215</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, <a href="sect111.htm">turn to 111</a>.</p>
