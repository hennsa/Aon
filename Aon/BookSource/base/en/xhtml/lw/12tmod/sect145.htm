<h3>145</h3>

<p>At once you recognize the pungent aroma of Adgana leaves. Adgana is a powerful narcotic that increases strength and sharpens reflexes; it enhances fighting prowess when swallowed immediately prior to combat. There is sufficient Adgana in this pouch for one dose, which would be enough to increase your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 6 points for the duration of a fight.</p>
<p>But be warned! Adgana is shunned by most warriors and its use is outlawed in Sommerlund because it is highly addictive. If you choose to keep and use this Dose of Adgana prior to combat, there is a chance that you could become addicted. As soon as combat is resolved, you must pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If the number you pick is 0 or 1, you have become addicted and your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score must be reduced by 4 points immediately. (This loss of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> is permanent.) If you have ever used Adgana in a previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure, the risks of addiction are doubled should you decide to use this dose (you will become addicted if you pick a 0, 1, 2, or 3 on the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. Also, the effects of the narcotic when used on a second or subsequent occasion are halved. You will be able to add only 3 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, instead of 6). If you decide to keep this Dose of Adgana, note the hazardous side effects of its use in the margin of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Sure that you have not overlooked any other items that could aid your perilous mission, you decide the time has come to leave.</p>
