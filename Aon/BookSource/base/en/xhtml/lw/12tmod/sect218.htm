<h3>218</h3>

<p>The creature falls limply to the floor as your killing blow slices it almost in two. Curious as to what manner of beast it was you lift back its sundered folds of rubbery grey flesh with the tip of your weapon and notice two sets of snake-like fangs, both still oozing a sticky yellow fluid. Your senses tell you that this fluid is deadly venom, capable of killing a victim in seconds. Whoever placed this Plaak in your cabin was attempting to assassinate you.</p>
<p>Disgusted by the smell of the creature, you flick its remains under your bunk. As you are rising to your feet, you hear a loud, intermittent whistle sounding on the deck above: it is the signal that Helgedad has been sighted by the lookout. With your heart pounding at the thought of seeing the Darklord’s most infamous stronghold for the first time, you leave your cabin and ascend to the deck above.</p>
