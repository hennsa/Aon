<h3>241</h3>

<p>For two days and nights the <cite>Intrepid</cite> forges a course through stormy waters, running ahead of a chill wind that sweeps down from the glaciers of Kalte in the north. The sea becomes increasingly hazardous, with sleet squalls and lightning storms that break without warning. Yet the dawn of the third day heralds a sudden change in the weather: fog, a windless, soundless, grey, forbidding damp that cuts off eyesight at an arm’s length and leaves the crew soaked and shivering. Many stare enviously at your Kalkoth hide cloak as they attend to their early morning duties in quiet discomfort.</p>
<p>‘Curse this fog,’ grumbles Captain Borse, staring helplessly at the clammy mist that holds his ship becalmed. ‘Better a gale or a Kuri-storm than this.’ For countless hours the ship lies dormant, rocking gently on the cold, listless sea. Staring at the wall of fog, it is easy to imagine all manner of creatures lurking within. The eerie silence does little to allay the superstitious fears of the crew, and when suddenly the quiet is disturbed by a shoal of red-finned sea carp, more than one man cries out in shocked surprise.</p>
