<h3>254</h3>

<p>All the bets are quickly placed and the pit-master prepares to start the proceedings, but the fight is over almost as soon as it begins. Without waiting for the pit-master to hammer the gong that signifies the start of combat, the orange-skinned fighter springs across the pit and buries its spiked club between the startled eyes of its opponent, killing him instantly. The crowd hoots with glee at the beast’s display of low cunning, and, despite some loud protests by those who bet on the humanoid, the pit-master reluctantly declares the reptilian the winner.</p>
<p>Bets are about to be placed on the next round of combat when a loud, intermittent whistle interrupts the preliminaries: it is the signal that Helgedad has been sighted by the lookout. Some of the crowd leave their seats in order to view the Black City through the tiny portholes that line the walls of the gallery. With your heart pounding at the thought of seeing the Darklands’ most infamous stronghold for the first time, you leave the pit and join them.</p>
