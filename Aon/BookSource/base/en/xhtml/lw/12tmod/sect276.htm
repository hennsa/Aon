<h3>276</h3>

<p>Your Arrow passes clean through the tendril and shatters against the far wall, drawing a flash of sparks where it punctures it. The harsh, metallic stench of ozone colours the foul air, and the creature withdraws its injured limb. Suddenly, a huge shape explodes from the crevasse, rising at such speed that its features are a blur. It emits a deafening screech and dives towards your chest, lashing you with its injured tendril before you have a chance to draw a hand weapon in your defence. There is another flash and a juddering pain runs the length of your arm, leaving it numb and nerveless: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Gritting your teeth against the pain, you fumble for a weapon as the creature begins its second swooping attack.</p>
<p class="combat">Ictakko (wounded): <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 24   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 31</p>
<p>Owing to the speed of its attack, and the wound you have sustained, you are unable to draw a hand weapon until the beginning of the third round of combat. Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Nexus and have reached the Kai rank of Archmaster, you must lose an extra 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point every time the Ictakko inflicts a wound during the combat, owing to the numbing effect of its electrical attack.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect343.htm">turn to 343</a>.</p>
