<h3>309</h3>

<p>You spin the ship’s wheel to starboard and pray for the wind to fill her sails and carry her clear of the first enemy vessel. Anxiously, you glance at the second ironclad steaming directly towards the stern with unnerving speed, its deck crammed with more troops poised to leap aboard. At first, the <cite>Intrepid</cite> responds to the rudder and you feel her swing about. But the escape is short-lived: the Drakkarim have secured her with hooks and ropes and she cannot break free.</p>
<p>With a shuddering crash, the ironclad rams the side, knocking everyone off their feet. You are sent reeling across the deck as the enemy craft ploughs deep into the hull, demolishing the steerage and carrying away a large section of the stern. Icy water thunders into the hold and immediately the ship begins to founder.</p>
<p><i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Darg ash ruzzar!’</i> bellow the enemy as they climb towards the deck, jostling and bullying each other in their eagerness to begin the battle. Their leader, a bull-necked brute armed with dirk and scimitar, is the first to appear at the rail. He pulls himself onto the deck and comes rushing forward, his eyes wide with blood-frenzy as he prepares to strike you down.</p>
