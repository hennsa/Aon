<h3>338</h3>

<p>The creature smiles, bows, and then shuffles away along the corridor, a quiet sniggering sound issuing from his thin mouth as he makes his way towards an iron-runged staircase. You watch him disappear up the stairs, and then you close and lock your cabin door. Tired and hungry, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points before you can settle down to sleep.</p>
<p>After several hours, you awake to the sound of a loud <i>click</i>, barely audible above the increased din of the Lajakeka’s engine, and at once you sense that your cabin door has just closed. Swiftly you rise from the bunk and rush to the door, hoping to catch a glimpse of whoever, or whatever, gained access to your room while you were asleep.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control and have reached the Kai rank of Mentora or higher, <a href="sect273.htm">turn to 273</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Magnakai training, <a href="sect98.htm">turn to 98</a>.</p>
