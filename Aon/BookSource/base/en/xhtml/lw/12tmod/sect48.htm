<h3>48</h3>

<p>You escape from the enemy and hide in a narrow alley, where you wait in silence. When you are sure that you are not being followed, you continue through the streets of this evil metropolis.</p>
<p>The way ahead is lit momentarily by an exploding fireball that showers this sector of the city with a rain of sparking cinders. In the brief light of the explosion you now see that the street along which you are walking is a cul-de-sac that ends abruptly at a square tower.</p>
<p>A creature, its face and body enveloped in a shroud-like robe, stands guard at the entrance to this ponderous building, clutching in its vulture-like claws a stave of iron that crackles with magical blue flames.</p>
<p>The sound of howling screams echoes in the darkness behind you, warning that you are being pursued. Rather than turn and face your pursuers, you decide to take refuge in the tower, but to do so you must first deal with the guard.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a Bow and wish to use it, <a href="sect324.htm">turn to 324</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="sect156.htm">turn to 156</a>.</p>
