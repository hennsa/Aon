<h3>5</h3>

<p>Your adversary is little more than a few feet away when you release your bowstring to send an Arrow streaking towards his chest. It hits with terrific force but, to your utter amazement, it fails to penetrate his flesh; the shaft shatters into a dozen harmless shards. With a scream of gleeful vengeance, the Drakkarim officer swings his scimitar down to cleave your neck in two. Instinct alone saves you from its razor-sharp edge. Immediately, he strikes again, swinging his blade back in a vicious arc that is aimed at your throat. You block the blow but it costs you your Bow, chopped almost in half as it stops the blade barely inches from your chin (remember to delete this Weapon from your <a href="action.htm">Weapons List</a>). Hurriedly you fumble for a hand weapon as he steadies himself to strike again.</p>
