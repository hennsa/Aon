<h3>58</h3>

<p>You hit the water with a mighty splash and sink like a stone beneath the icy waves, yet the shock serves to electrify your senses and you quickly strike out for the surface. You emerge from the depths, coughing and gasping for air, in time to see the enemy ironclad come steaming alongside the blazing <cite>Intrepid</cite>. Its great steel hull passes within a few yards of where you are treading water. Fearful that you could be drowned in its wake, you swim towards it and latch on to the bow as it moves past. The heads of the rivets, which secure its steel skin, offer a handhold for your fingers and enable you to drag yourself onto its deck.</p>
<p>You have had barely enough time to draw breath when a Drakkarim sailor, armed with a billhook, rushes forwards and aims a blow at your head.</p>
<p class="combat">Drakkarim Sailor: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 19   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 24</p>
<p>Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, reduce your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 2 points for the first round of this fight, owing to the speed and surprise of your enemy’s attack.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect243.htm">turn to 243</a>.</p>
