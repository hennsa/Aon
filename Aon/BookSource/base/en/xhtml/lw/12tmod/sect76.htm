<h3>76</h3>

<p>The dry dock is unguarded and none of the Drakkarim appear to pay any special attention to you when you enter on horseback. You dismount and tether your horse to a post before making your way through the tangle of steel beams and plates that are strewn around the juggernaut’s exposed keel. A group of slaves are at work near the stern, hoisting into position a strange spherical tank made of a sparkling orange metal. As soon as it is secured, the Drakkarim engineers begin coupling heavy springs and thick copper cables to the tank, linking it to a massive propeller at the rear of the craft.</p>
<p>Carefully you study the complex machinery, soon realizing that if the orange tank were destroyed, or damaged beyond repair, the vessel would be unable to propel itself. However, the shell of the tank appears to be constructed of super-hard metal, and the only way you can think of destroying it is by using your Crystal Explosive.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to use your Crystal Explosive to destroy the giant ironclad, <a href="sect69.htm">turn to 69</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose not to use it, but decide to search instead for some other means of sabotaging the vessel, <a href="sect210.htm">turn to 210</a>.</p>
