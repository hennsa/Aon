<h3>109</h3>

<p>As the two figures turn from the table, you recognize the red robes they are wearing. At first you assumed them to be Cener Druids, but their garments are not the same. They have black hoods, and the skull-like motifs which are embroidered upon them identify these two to be members of an evil sect known as the Acolytes of Vashna.</p>
<p>The presence here of two worshippers of Vashna, who was once the greatest of all the Darklords, rekindles chilling memories of past encounters with these fanatics. Following the downfall of the Darklords you had assumed that the last remnants of the sect had vanished forever, yet here before you are two who still wear their robes and practise their vile necromantic art.</p>
<p>Fearful that you have stumbled upon a secret Cenerese conspiracy, you inch your way closer to the robed men to listen to their whispered conversation.</p>
