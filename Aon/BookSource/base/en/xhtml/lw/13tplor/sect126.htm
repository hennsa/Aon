<h3>126</h3>

<p>A sudden noise startles you and you spin around to face it. A section of the wall is moving inwards, carrying with it the robes that are hanging there. A figure, dressed in a hooded purple cloak and clasping a large leather-bound book, appears in the opening. As he steps into the room the section of wall closes behind him.</p>
<p>‘What are you doing here, brother?’ he asks, his voice heavy with suspicion. You sense that he is a druid of high rank and you know your answer must be convincing if you are to avoid his wrath.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to answer by saying that you have come here to help him, <a href="sect170.htm">turn to 170</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to say that you are looking for a lost possession, <a href="sect156.htm">turn to 156</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide that actions speak louder than words, you can attack him by <a href="sect212.htm">turning to 212</a>.</p>
