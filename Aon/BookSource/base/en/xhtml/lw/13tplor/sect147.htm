<h3>147</h3>

<p>You clear the gap with inches to spare but not entirely without cost. The portcullis snares your Backpack and, as you roll away, it is torn from your shoulders and crushed when the heavy portal slams to the ground. (You must now erase all Backpack Items and Meals from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>You spring to your feet instantly and run headlong across the drawbridge towards the far side. Arrows rain down on you from the battlements, but your speed and agility keep you from being hit. Then, within seconds of reaching firm ground, you are confronted by a group of three Vazhag returning from battle. Two are armed with spears and they face you on foot, but the third sits astride a captured Slovian steed. It is wielding a cavalry lance and you can tell by the way the rat-man balances it that it is skilled in its use.</p>
<p>The two spear-wielders squeal their battle-cry and attack you simultaneously. However, this cry is quickly transformed into a duet of pain when you strike out and kill them instantly. They drop to the ground and almost immediately the rider is upon you, jabbing at your chest with the tip of its lance. You duck the first thrust, and steady yourself to meet the second as the Vazhag lancer turns and bears down on you once more.</p>
