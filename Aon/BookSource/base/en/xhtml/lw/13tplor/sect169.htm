<h3>169</h3>

<p>Ably you sidestep and dodge your way through the throng of female Vazhag who are swarming around the wagon in a food-starved frenzy. One of them runs across your path, forcing you to halt momentarily to avoid crashing into her. But before you can continue, a Vazhag guard is shouldered away from the wagon by the crowd and he collides with you. Swiftly you grab the creature by the throat to stop it from warning its confederates, and drag it one-handedly towards the shadowy cavern wall.</p>
<p>Suddenly you feel something crawling up your forearm. A wave of revulsion knots your stomach when you see a mass of black fleas coursing up your arm, migrating from the neck of the frightened Vazhag. The ghastly sight makes you loosen your grip and allows the disease-ridden creature to squeal a desperate cry for help. As one, the guards respond to the cry. They draw their rusty weapons and narrow their tiny red eyes as they abandon the wagon and advance upon you.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stand and fight these Vazhag, <a href="sect313.htm">turn to 313</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to evade them, you can escape through the open portal by <a href="sect204.htm">turning to 204</a>.</p>
