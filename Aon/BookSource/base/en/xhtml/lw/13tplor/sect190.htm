<h3>190</h3>

<p>As you force your way through the narrow thorny corridor, you are aware that the Vazhag are now streaming into the gap, close on your heels. In desperation, you turn and force your way into the wall of tangled briar and call upon your Kai Mastery of camouflage to mask your location.</p>
<p>The rat-men scurry past. You hear them in the distance, burrowing deeper into the thicket, but still you remain exactly where you are. Your caution is well-placed for soon the Vazhag retrace their steps, having lost all trace of you.</p>
<p>The Cener blazes with anger at the failure of his minions to carry out such a simple command. With a flick of his rod you see him reduce one luckless rodent to ashes, and shorten the tail of another by a broadsword’s length. Loudly he vents his displeasure and, among the oaths and vile curses, you hear him utter his intention to report to his master, Arch Druid Cadak, that there is an enemy assassin at large in the forest.</p>
<p>You know that he must not be allowed to make his report. If he were to reach Mogaruith and raise the alarm, your mission, and probably your life, would soon be over.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Bow and Arrows and wish to use them, <a href="sect104.htm">turn to 104</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess mastery of Magi-magic and wish to use it, <a href="sect144.htm">turn to 144</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use it, <a href="sect185.htm">turn to 185</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess none of the above or choose not to make use of them, <a href="sect90.htm">turn to 90</a>.</p>
