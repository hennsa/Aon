<h3>195</h3>

<p>Drawing upon your special skills and your reserves of physical strength, you pull your lower body out of the cold lake and slowly raise your knees up to your chin. The toes of your boots find footholds between the timbers and there you hold yourself, completely motionless, while your Grand Mastery of Assimilance causes your shadowy outline to blend in perfectly with the underside of the drawbridge.</p>
<p>The Vazhag scour the lake’s edge thoroughly. They search beneath the bridge, passing within a few paces of your location and yet, despite their keen senses, they completely fail to notice you. Disappointedly, they report their lack of findings to their Cenerese commander before clambering back onto the platform. You hear the Cener and the remaining Vazhag trooping across the bridge. They stop just long enough to open the Tzarg cage and drag out one of the croaking creatures. Then the cage door squeaks shut, a key jangles in its lock, and briskly the party marches away along the south passage.</p>
<p>For a full minute you remain immobile until you are sure that the enemy have gone. Then you pull yourself up onto the bridge and, without looking back, you hurry across the lake and enter the tunnel on the north side of the cave.</p>
