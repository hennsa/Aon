<h3>201</h3>

<p>You kneel beside the tunnel wall and wait with trepidation as the sound of the approaching group grows louder and nearer. Torchlight flickers, casting a watery yellow beam across the cavern floor; then the first of the group enters and you catch sight of their ugly forms.</p>
<p>A patrol of six Vazhag files into the cavern. Each one is as tall as a Sommlending youth and all are armed with crude, rusty weapons. Fragments of armour and uniforms, which once belonged to human soldiers, encase their hairy, rat-like bodies. They are no more than ten feet away from your hiding place, and they give off such a vile aroma of filth and disease that you are forced to draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to prevent yourself from retching out loud.</p>
<p>They halt at the foot of the stone stairs and talk with each other in a high-pitched squeal which reminds you of rusty door hinges. All the while they repeatedly cast furtive glances along the west tunnel as if they are waiting impatiently for another of their party to catch up. Within minutes another member of their patrol does arrive, only this creature is not one of their breed: it is human-sized. However, the hooded scarlet robe it is wearing makes it difficult for you to be absolutely sure that the creature within is human.</p>
<p>The Vazhag cease their squealing when the hooded one raises a gloved hand and motions to the south tunnel, pointing directly at the place where you are hiding. For an instant, you catch a glimpse of the glassy green mask that is covering his face, and at once you recognize this mask: it is a <i xml:lang="x-cenerese">jazak</i>, the ritual mask of a Cener Druid.</p>
