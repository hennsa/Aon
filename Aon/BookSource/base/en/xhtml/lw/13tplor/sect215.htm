<h3>215</h3>

<p>You spit out the words of a Brotherhood Spell and instantly you rise into the sky, as if plucked off the ground by some invisible giant. The crackling ray speeds past below your feet and explodes harmlessly among the ancient rocks. As the dust settles, you arrest your levitation and lower yourself back towards the ground, your muscles tense in readiness to run as soon as your boots touch down.</p>
<p>The druid is visibly stunned by your display of magic. However, he quickly recovers his senses, and as soon as you return to the ruins he shouts at his Vazhag minions, commanding them to attack and rip you to shreds.</p>
<p>With hatred blazing in their blood-red eyes, the Vazhag advance towards the ancient ruins, each carrying a rusty weapon poised for the kill.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stand and fight these disease-ridden Vazhag, <a href="sect25.htm">turn to 25</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to attempt to evade them, <a href="sect279.htm">turn to 279</a>.</p>
