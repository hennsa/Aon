<h3>220</h3>

<p>The cauldron smashes down into the centre of the hall and explodes with devastating effect, spewing its deadly contents in all directions. A tidal wave of acid engulfs the tables, submerging and burning everything not made of stone, porcelain, or glass. The pitiful screams of the druids rise above the thunderous din as they and their deadly work are consumed by a merciless sea of corrosive.</p>
<p>Suddenly an arrow passes within a few inches of your face. The Vazhag archers have reached the top of the ladder and are poised to rush onto the platform itself. Anxiously you look around for some means of escape, but when none readily appears you fear you are trapped. Then you notice an observation platform jutting out of the wall. It is over on the far side of the hall, more than thirty yards away, and lies some ten feet below your present position.</p>
<p>A daring escape plan forms in your mind’s eye and hurriedly you cast off your Cener Robe and Mask, a disguise which is now redundant, and prepare to enact your vision (erase the Robe and Mask from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>). You reach out and grab hold of the chain which once supported the cauldron. Then, using all your strength, you draw it back and leap into the air as the momentum carries you off the platform.</p>
<p>Your stomach churns as you swing across the hall and glance down at the dreadful carnage taking place a hundred feet below. Angry squeals and a clutch of arrows follow in your wake as the Vazhag archers try desperately to prevent you from getting away. Grimly you cling to the chain as it nears the end of its arc, and try to ignore the arrows that are whistling by on either side.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 2 to the number you have chosen. If your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score is 28 or higher, add 1.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 0–2, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 3–6, <a href="sect267.htm">turn to 267</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 7 or higher, <a href="sect71.htm">turn to 71</a>.</p>
