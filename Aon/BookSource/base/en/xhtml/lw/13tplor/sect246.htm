<h3>246</h3>

<p>With your lungs aching desperately for air, you propel yourself towards the shimmering, pale blue light and burst through the surface, choking and spluttering like a netted fish. You gulp at the cool air hungrily and try simultaneously to take stock of your new surroundings. You have surfaced in a vaulted chamber, small by comparison with the one from which you have just escaped, but substantial nevertheless. Here, there is no shoreline, just sheer rock walls, but to your left you see a narrow ledge of flat stone and you swim towards it. As you clamber out of the water you notice the source of the pale light that drew you to this chamber. Directly above the ledge there is a natural chimney which rises into the ceiling, and at its end you see a warm, lantern-like glow. The chimney is rough and pitted, and to someone of your experience it is as easy to climb as a wide-stepped ladder.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes you reach the neck of the chimney and find yourself staring through a hole at the floor of a passageway beyond. The source of the light comes from several oil lamps which hang at regular intervals from the roof of this narrow tunnel.</p>
<p>You can sense the presence of Vazhag somewhere in the vicinity, and so you choose to wait here in case a patrol is about to pass this way.</p>
<p>During your wait, unless you possess Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
