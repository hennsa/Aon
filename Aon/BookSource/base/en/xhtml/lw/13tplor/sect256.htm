<h3>256</h3>

<p>‘How dare you delay me with trivial formalities!’ you bellow, and slap the Vazhag aside with the palm of your hand. The creature snarls and raises its spear defensively. ‘Delay me a moment longer and I’ll see you are boiled alive in your own grease,’ you growl. ‘Let me pass!’</p>
<p>Your bold threat works. The rat-man’s confidence crumbles and nervously he shuffles to one side, lowering his spear as you advance towards him. At that moment, a column of Vazhag and a wagon laden with weapons converge beneath the archway, blocking it completely. Chaos ensues, but the confusion is to your advantage. Quickly you abandon your undead companion and weave your way through the crowd, into the keep beyond. There you notice several smaller entrances surrounding the flagstoned square. One in particular looks promising: a staircase that descends to a portal set into the base of the citadel.</p>
<p>You are heading towards this entrance when unexpectedly you are confronted by three Cener Druids. They emerge from an alley and come walking towards you in a line abreast. To avoid them you are forced to sidestep quickly into a shadowy doorway.</p>
