<h3>264</h3>

<p>Raising your right hand, you call to mind the thoughts of the Brotherhood Spell of Lightning Hand, as taught to you by Guildmaster Banedon, and focus the power of this spell upon the tips of your first three fingers. You feel a burning sensation. It becomes more intense until your whole hand aches with a gnawing pain (lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>You are tempted to abandon the spell but quickly you stifle this urge and project the spell at the middle of the fleeing druid’s back. There is a crackling sound, like the crumpling of dried parchment; then a bright blue light shoots from the tips of your fingers and hits the Cener like a hammer between the shoulder blades, sending him sprawling head-first into a tangle of thorny briars.</p>
<p>Stunned and groaning, the druid fumbles for his slender golden rod and quickly his spindly fingers locate it. However, before he can use it to retaliate, you sprint across the clearing, weapon in hand, and slay him with a single blow to the head. Curiosity prompts you to prise away the druid’s green mask and look upon the face of this servant of evil. It is an ugly, disease-riddled face, human in shape yet lacking any trace of humanity.</p>
<p>Reluctantly you search him and discover the following items:</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Cener Robe (If kept, this item will occupy 2 spaces in your Backpack)</li>
<li>Cener Mask</li>
<li>20 Lune (equivalent to 5 Gold Crowns)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to keep any of the above, remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>Your Magnakai skills tell you that the golden rod no longer possesses any magical aura; its destructive powers vanished the moment its wielder breathed his last. You stoop to prise it from the dead druid’s hand, but as soon as your fingers touch its metallic surface it disintegrates into a foul-smelling dust.</p>
<p>With twilight but an hour away, you leave the clearing via the gap and hurry along the muddy track beyond.</p>
