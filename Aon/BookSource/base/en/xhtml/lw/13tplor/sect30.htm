<h3>30</h3>

<p>With trepidation you approach the door, fully aware that you are walking into a trap. Spear-wielding Vazhag hover on either side, alert and suspicious, their tarnished weapons held in readiness to strike should you show any sign of resistance.</p>
<p>A cell awaits you beyond the door. It seems to be no more than what you expected to find and, as the heavy door is slammed shut, you begin immediately to search for a means of escape before the Vazhag guards return.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite its plain appearance, this cell is far more than you expected it to be. It is an extermination chamber, one of several located throughout Mogaruith. It is designed for the speedy destruction of those who would dare to challenge the Cenerese.</p>
<p>Suddenly a powerful electrical current is fed into the metal floor and you are transfixed as the deadly voltage courses through your body. You fight with all your strength to survive this terrible onslaught but the current is irresistible and, eventually, your body can take no more.</p>
<p class="deadend">Sadly, your life and your quest end here in Mogaruith.</p>
