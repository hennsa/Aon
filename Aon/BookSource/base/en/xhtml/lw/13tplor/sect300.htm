<h3>300</h3>

<p>The symbols form concentric circles which spell out a grim message:</p>
<p>‘Humble thyself for thou art worthless like the dust before He who dwells herein. Pay homage to the emissary of the Lords of Decay for He is the instrument of their intention. Abase thyself afore His power. Hail, mighty Cadak of Mogaruith!’</p>
<p>Fear and uncertainty knot your stomach as you stand and stare at the door to Arch Druid Cadak’s throne hall. Your senses scream at you to turn and run from this place for the air is so heavy with evil that you feel as if you are being slowly suffocated to death. But on this occasion you resist your instincts, for you have yet to discover where the Cenerese are cultivating their deadly plague virus and you know that the answer to that question can most likely be found here.</p>
<p>With fear running cold in your veins, you steel yourself and step towards the glowing door. As you come within a few feet of its pulsating surface, a band of intense light washes over you from head to toe.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Grand Mastery of Kai-screen, <a href="sect236.htm">turn to 236</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess mastery of this skill, <a href="sect6.htm">turn to 6</a>.</p>
