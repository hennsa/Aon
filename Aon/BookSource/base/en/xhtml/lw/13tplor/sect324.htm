<h3>324</h3>

<p>The flaming oil hits you like a fiery shower full in the face yet, protected by your Grand Mastery of Nexus, you suffer no harm. The Cener freezes with shock and gurgles inanely as, unhurriedly, you wipe the blazing oil from your face with the edge of your hand and pat out the tongues of flames which have sprung from parts of your tunic splashed by the oil.</p>
<p>Numbly the Cener fumbles for a weapon. He draws a curvy-bladed knife from a hidden sheath and holds it out unsteadily in front of his chest. You tell him to drop the dagger but he is deaf to your command. He lunges. You deflect his weak attack with your right forearm and counter it with a left hook to the chin which shatters the druid’s glassy mask. He reels backwards and crashes to the floor, his bony fingers clutching his throat. For a moment he writhes around on the dusty ground; then his body stiffens and he lies completely still. Cautiously you step nearer, expecting trickery. Then you see that a shattered fragment of his mask has severed his jugular vein and thus sealed his fate.</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="sect306.htm">turn to 306</a>.</p>
