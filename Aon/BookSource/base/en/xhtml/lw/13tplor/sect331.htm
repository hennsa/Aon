<h3>331</h3>

<p>The Vazhag are totally unaware of your presence as you slip through the milling throng and escape into the empty passage which lies beyond the iron portal. A few minutes later, as you are exploring this new tunnel, you hear their anxious squealing cease and the great door close with a rumbling boom.</p>
<p>The passage continues eastwards for several miles and, with the exception of an occasional Vazhag sentry, it is virtually deserted. At length you arrive at the entrance to another hall, smaller than the lava-cavern but equally as crowded. Daylight streams into this hall through a large archway guarded by armoured Vazhag, and pairs of horny-skinned war-dogs which they hold on the leash. Beyond the archway you can see a track that disappears towards a distant ridge of hills.</p>
<p>Directly above the archway, you notice a thin ray of sunlight streaming through a window-like hole in the rock. Sorely aware that the main entrance is so heavily guarded that it will be very difficult, even for someone as gifted as yourself, to escape that way undetected, you resolve instead to escape by means of the smaller opening in the rock wall.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, add 3 to the number you have chosen.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 5 or less, <a href="sect192.htm">turn to 192</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 6 or more, <a href="sect346.htm">turn to 346</a>.</p>
