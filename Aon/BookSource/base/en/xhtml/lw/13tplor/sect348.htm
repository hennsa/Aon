<h3>348</h3>

<p>Without a sound you raise your weapon and tense yourself in readiness to strike. At first the Vazhag and the Cener seem unaware of your presence. But as they move to enter the south tunnel, the Vazhag suddenly freeze in their tracks and begin squealing frantically.</p>
<p>The sound galvanizes you into action. Like a panther hungry for the kill, swiftly and silently you leap among the Vazhag and strike down the two nearest with one scything blow. Before they have fallen you kick out at the chest of another and feel its bones crack under the impact. A side-swipe puts paid to a fourth of their number, neatly parting its disease-riddled head from its shoulders. You pause for breath, and see the remaining enemy backing away in shocked confusion.</p>
<p>Ineptly they fumble to unsheathe their weapons whilst the Cener screams at them to avenge their slain comrades. One Vazhag plucks up enough courage to attack you and, with ease, you duck its whistling sword stroke. Before it can strike again, you can dispatch the beast with a lightning-fast stab through the heart. Your strike is executed with such economy of movement that, to the druid and the remaining Vazhag, it looks as if you hardly moved at all. For the sole surviving Vazhag it is the last straw and, with a squeal of abject terror, it drops its torch and rusty blade and scurries for the dark safety of the north tunnel.</p>
<p>Cursing vilely, the Cener retreats until his red-robed back is pressed flat against the cavern wall. His mask hides his entire face, yet even so you can sense the blazing hatred that is pouring from his eyes, as if it were a stream of liquid fire. You raise your weapon and advance, eager to finish the druid swiftly, but you are halted by a sudden, unexpected pulse of psychic energy that crashes like a wave against your mind.</p>
