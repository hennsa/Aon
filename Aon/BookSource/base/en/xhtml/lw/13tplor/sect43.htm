<h3>43</h3>

<p>Even though your Bow and Quiver are covered by your druid’s robe, you retrieve them and are ready to fire at the fleeing Vazhag before either has taken a dozen paces. In lightning succession you draw and fire two Arrows, sending the shafts thudding into the backs of the two rat-men with unerring accuracy. Simultaneously they crash to the ground and lie still.</p>
<p>Your swift dispatching of the Vazhag has gone undetected and, anxious that it remains so, you rush forward to drag their bodies away into the undergrowth. Within minutes the task is complete.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you still have to find a way of entering Mogaruith. Yet, as you return to the trail, you are struck by a bold idea. Calmly you approach the zombie, who has remained stationary throughout the incident, and stoop to retrieve the poor creature’s chain. Then, with pounding heart you turn and slowly walk along the trail towards the crowded drawbridge.</p>
