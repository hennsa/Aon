<h3>52</h3>

<p>Swiftly you swim away from the bridge towards the east wall of the cave. You can see no obvious exit here, but twenty feet below the surface you notice that the crevasse appears to undercut the cave wall.</p>
<p>Suddenly a spear splashes into the lake and passes within inches of your head, causing you to dive deeper to avoid the others that are sure to follow. In the icy gloom you sense an undercurrent of warmer water rising from the crevasse. Also, your super-keen eyesight detects a pale light radiating from the base of the cave wall. Another cavern must lie beyond this one, but you have no way of knowing for sure just how far away that cave might be.</p>
<p>Mustering your Kai courage, you swim down towards the crevasse and propel yourself along an oval-shaped tunnel below the east cave wall. In the distance you see the pale glow and you strike out towards it, thankful that at least this watery passage does not harbour hostile creatures.</p>
<p>After four long minutes of strenuous swimming, you begin to suffer pains in your chest due to lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>, and add 1 to the number you have picked. This total is equal to the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points you lose due to oxygen starvation.</p>
<p class="choice">Adjust your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points total accordingly and then <a href="sect246.htm">turn to 246</a>.</p>
