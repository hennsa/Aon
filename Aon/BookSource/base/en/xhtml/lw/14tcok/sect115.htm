<h3>115</h3>

<p>The stairs seem to go on forever. You lose count of the number of levels through which you ascend and, after an hour of relentless climbing, you feel the need for rest and refreshment. Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Eventually the stairs end at a tunnel which leads to a hall. However, you cannot enter this hall because it is blocked by a huge stone statue which has been tipped onto its side. The statue must have shattered on impact, for the tunnel exit is almost filled with large boulders. The thought of having to descend the stairs you have just laboured up fills you with dread, but in order to gain access to the hall beyond you must first clear away some of the heavy debris.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. Now subtract 1 from the number you have picked.</p>
<p>The resultant score equals the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost due to fatigue. (If you picked 0 or 1, your score is zero.)</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect100.htm">turn to 100</a>.</p>
