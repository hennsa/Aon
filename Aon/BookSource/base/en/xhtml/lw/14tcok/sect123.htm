<h3>123</h3>

<p>Skilfully you tail the group, using the cover of doorways and debris to hide your presence as you move through a maze of streets and alleyways. At length you reach a wide avenue bisected by a dead river of salty, acid water. The group cross this foul stream by a bridge, and then enter a two-storey, flat-roofed building which is guarded by other Giaks, wearing similar orange-patched uniforms. In the distance you can hear the faint sounds of battle.</p>
<p>Patiently you observe the building and its Giak guards. The front door appears to be well defended, but there is another entrance, at the end of an alley which runs alongside the building, that looks to be unguarded. An iron stair ascends to this entrance on the upper floor.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate this second entrance, <a href="sect273.htm">turn to 273</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to approach this building, you can leave this section of Kaag by <a href="sect171.htm">turning to 171</a>.</p>
