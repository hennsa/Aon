<h3>160</h3>

<p>You enter the nearest building through a stable door in the north wall. Inside, you narrowly avoid colliding with a Drakkarim warrior who is carrying two buckets of water, one in either hand. Your speedy reflexes, and your Kai camouflage skills, prevent this. They also prevent him from seeing you enter. You follow him and soon find yourself in a cavernous hall which is divided into scores of small pens. Each pen is barred with iron gates which keep secure the Doomwolves that are stabled within. You use your Magnakai skill of Animal Control to mask your scent, but even so, some of the larger Doomwolves are becoming noticeably restless in your presence.</p>
<p>You leave the hall by an archway which leads to a long, narrow passage. You have taken less than a dozen steps when you see a group of Drakkarim approaching in the distance. The passage is dark, but it is too narrow to risk hiding here; the Drakkarim would likely brush against you as they passed.</p>
<p>Looking around for a way to avoid them, you notice two doors, one on either side of the passageway.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter the door to your left, <a href="sect272.htm">turn to 272</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to enter the door to your right, <a href="sect244.htm">turn to 244</a>.</p>
