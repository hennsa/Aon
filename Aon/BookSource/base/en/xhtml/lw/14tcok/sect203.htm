<h3>203</h3>

<p>As you are ascending the steps towards the curtain of light which hangs before the main entrance your Kai senses warn you that there is danger ahead. You halt and listen. At first you hear nothing; then you detect the sound of marching feet. The sound stops and moments later you see the curtain of light shimmering; the doors to the hall have been opened.</p>
<p>Cursing your luck, you turn and run towards the tunnel as the first few soldiers of a Drakkarim patrol come marching through the light-curtain into the hall. They command you to halt but you ignore them and hurry across the tiered hall as fast as you can. Burdened by the weight of your friend, you cannot move as quickly as you would like, and before you reach the mouth of the tunnel the Drakkarim are taking aim at you with their bows.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Grand Huntmastery and have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian, <a href="sect2.htm">turn to 2</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill or have yet to reach this level of Kai rank, <a href="sect269.htm">turn to 269</a>.</p>
