<h3>207</h3>

<p>You return to collect Banedon; then, once he is safely across your shoulders, you climb the stairs and hurry through the archway. A tunnel lined with rich wood panelling leads to a chamber where eight smaller passages disappear off in all directions. You scan these exits and a familiar fear returns to haunt you, a fear that you will never find your way out of Kaag alive.</p>
<p>Using your innate healing skills, you try once more to revive Banedon. You remember once, during a tutorial at the Kai Monastery, that Banedon conjured up a vision of the monastery and its surrounding estates. You were able to see yourself in miniature, standing in your chambers as if you were a tiny animated doll in a doll’s house. If he were well enough to perform that spell here in Kaag, you might be able to locate your position and plan a route of escape.</p>
<p>Mustering your skills, you place your hands on Banedon’s chest and transmit your power directly into his heart. (Reduce your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> by 3 points.) Gradually Banedon stirs to consciousness and, as his strength returns, rekindled by your healing power, he is able to grant your request. On the floor of the chamber he calls forth a living, three-dimensional vision of Kaag. Gradually this vision expands until you are looking at yourselves, kneeling on the floor of a chamber on one of the upper levels of the central citadel. The vision blurs and fades, but not before you are able to trace the quickest way out of this dreadful place.</p>
<p>The passage which heads due south from this chamber leads directly to the Zlanbeast pens and landing platforms situated on the exterior wall of the citadel, high above the great South Gate. It is from here that you plan to escape, leaving the citadel by the same way you entered it: by air.</p>
<p>Confident that the success of your quest is now within your grasp, you help Banedon to his feet and support him as you make your way along the south passage.</p>
