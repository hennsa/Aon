<h3>252</h3>

<p>The corridor passes through a series of interconnecting caverns, some of which are occupied by lowly Giak slaves engaged in menial tasks, none of whom notice your stealthy passing. After almost an hour, you arrive at a cavernous hall filled with iron cages in which lie countless Akataz, a breed of leathery war-dogs used by the Drakkarim. Nearby are a group of Drakkarim handlers seated at a table playing cards.</p>
<p>From the shadows you listen to their idle chatter, hoping to glean clues as to the location of Zagarna’s courtroom, but, unfortunately, your patience goes unrewarded. These brutish humanoids seem preoccupied with their game, and the unfairness of their duties here in the Akataz pen. However, from their banal conversation you do learn two interesting facts about the struggle taking place within Kaag. The two warring factions are fighting principally for control over the Giak spawning vats located in the dungeons of this citadel. The vats are the key to power here; they produce both an unending supply of fresh troops and a ready source of raw food for whoever controls them.</p>
<p>Anxious to continue your quest, you resolve to leave the pen by an archway on the far side. Although confident that your camouflage skills will keep you hidden from the Drakkarim, the hall is full of keen-nosed war-dogs.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, add 2 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is 4 or less, <a href="sect92.htm">turn to 92</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5 or more, <a href="sect109.htm">turn to 109</a>.</p>
