<h3>257</h3>

<p>With a loud <i>crack</i>, the Drakkar hits the cobblestones head-first and is knocked unconscious. Quickly you descend the iron stairs and drag his limp body out of sight, fearful that it might be seen by a passing patrol. Already a huge bruise is beginning to discolour his face and you are sure that it will be many hours before he regains consciousness. As you are moving him, you notice that he wears two chains around his neck. To one there is attached a Whistle; to the other a Brass Key. If you wish to keep either of these Backpack Items, adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied that he is well hidden, you climb the stairs and carefully push open the heavy door. At the end of a short corridor there is a landing where a gallery overlooks the cavernous lower level. Nearby there is a staircase, leading down, and to your right a black oak door set flush to the wall.</p>
<p>Slowly you approach the gallery’s railed parapet and peer over at an unnerving sight.</p>
