<h3>274</h3>

<p>Using your Magnakai Discipline of Telegnosis, you induce a trance that allows your conscious mind to leave your physical body and float across the fiery moat towards Banedon’s prone form. Telepathically you call to him, trying to awaken him to consciousness, but you are unable to make contact. Then unexpectedly, your psychic calls are answered by a blood-chilling scream.</p>
<p>Horror floods your mind when you realize that the person before you is not your friend Banedon—it is a Helghast. As the creature rises and its features twist and distort before your gaze, you cast an anxious glance back across the moat to the place where your physical body stands. Through the great door come two Drakkarim guards behind a slavering boar-like creature which is straining on its leash. With relish they release the beast and it bounds towards your inanimate body, its jaws snapping wildly. Fear blazes scarlet as you will your spirit towards your body, desperate to reunite before the boar-thing tears your flesh to shreds.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score is 20 or more, add 1 to the number you have picked. If your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> is 19 or less, deduct 1.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 3 or less, <a href="sect299.htm">turn to 299</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4 or more, <a href="sect122.htm">turn to 122</a>.</p>
