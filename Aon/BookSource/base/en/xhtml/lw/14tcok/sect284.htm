<h3>284</h3>

<p>Before you land the killing blow which parts the head of this ghastly Vordak, it shrieks a cry of alarm that attracts a Zlanbeast circling in the smoky sky above. The winged reptilian answers its call by swooping down and raking you with its serrated beak.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add 1 to this number. The resulting total is equivalent to the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points you lose due to the Zlanbeast’s attack.</p>
<p>Before you can retaliate, the winged creature soars into the air and disappears. Cursing its departure, you look down to see that the body of the slain Vordak is no longer there. It has transformed into a foul-smelling green gas.</p>
<p>Mindful that the Zlanbeast might summon others of its kind, you sheathe your weapon and escape from the area as quickly as you can. At the end of the street you see an avenue leading off to the south, and another, blocked by rubble, heading off to the west.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to follow the avenue southwards, <a href="sect142.htm">turn to 142</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to clamber over the rubble which fills the entrance to the west avenue, <a href="sect35.htm">turn to 35</a>.</p>
