<h3>343</h3>

<p>You follow the dank passage for over a mile before you reach its end. There you discover an iron door, eaten by rust, its lock made useless by years of acidic corrosion. Using your Magnakai skill of Nexus you free the lock mechanism, and then lever open the door to reveal a short flight of steps which are almost unrecognizable beneath a carpet of moss and fungi.</p>
<p>Cautiously you ascend, clearing the way ahead with your weapon before trusting it to your step. The stairs emerge at street level, in the midst of a once-grand building which now lies in ruin. Through one of its shattered windows you look out upon a concourse littered with more than a dozen Giak dead. Their posture, and the nature of their wounds, tell of a savage street battle fought here within the last few hours. Perched on nearby rooftops are a flock of vulture-like birds, cawing delightedly, their bellies distended by a feast of Giak meat.</p>
<p>The distant clang and clash of steel tell you that the fighting is not over; it has simply moved on. The noise prompts you to stay crouched in the ruins whilst you consider your next course of action. From this position you survey the street and notice a narrow stairway, directly opposite, which leads down to a crypt door. You focus on the dark portal and sense at once that it is open and unguarded.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to cross the street and investigate the crypt, <a href="sect228.htm">turn to 228</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to ignore the crypt, <a href="sect303.htm">turn to 303</a>.</p>
