<h3>54</h3>

<p>‘So we meet again, Lone Wolf.’</p>
<p>The words, full of hatred, are spoken by a tall, ancient figure, whose gaunt face is framed by a shock of platinum hair. It is Arch Druid Cadak, ruler of Mogaruith, the leader of the Cener Druids of Ruel.</p>
<p>‘What is your purpose here, Cadak?’ you growl in reply, your weapon raised in case he or his minions should attempt to rush you.</p>
<p>‘I am ruler of this city now. After all, is it not fitting that I should inherit the legacy of the Darklords?’ Cadak’s whimsical mood seems to change for the worse, a change reflected in his voice.</p>
<p>‘Your meddlesome intrusions have cost me dear, Kai Lord,’ he hisses. ‘We have a debt to settle and I intend to make you pay what you owe. I brought you here. It was my purpose. I have no interest in the inferior magic of this fool you call friend,’ he says, sneering at Banedon, ‘yet I knew he would be bait enough to lure you.’</p>
<p>Slowly he steps towards the shadows and you tense yourself, fearing an imminent attack.</p>
<p>‘Now you will settle your debt … ’ he says, almost in a whisper, ‘once and for all!’</p>
<p>He snaps his fingers and you hear the creak of a heavy iron door slowly opening. Then a low, snorting noise echoes through the pen, stirring the caged Kraan and Zlanbeast to sudden frenzy. You steel yourself and cast your eyes around in a desperate attempt to see what it is that is responsible for this sudden uproar. Then the cause emerges into the light and your blood runs ice cold in your veins when you look upon its terrible face.</p>
