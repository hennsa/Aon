<h3>67</h3>

<p>You push aside the last remaining Drakkar and rush out into the passageway. At the far end you find a door which leads to a covered courtyard. A group of Drakkarim stablehands are sent sprawling as you career through them and sprint towards a low wall which encircles this part of the complex. Without looking back, you leap over the wall in one bound and race into the ruins beyond.</p>
<p>For over a mile you wend your way through derelict buildings before you happen upon an avenue which is surprisingly clear of debris and obstructions. You are conscious that perhaps it is too clear, offering you no cover at all from the tall buildings that line this route to the centre of Kaag.</p>
<p>You decide to trust to the ruins rather than run the risk of being detected out in the open. However, within a matter of minutes you are confronted by a new hazard. The ground in this section of the city is unsafe. It is riddled with pot-holes and concealed cellars, covered by rotten wooden beams and slabs of paper-thin plaster. Suddenly one such section gives way beneath your feet and you find yourself falling headlong into coal-black darkness.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, add 2 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 0–5, <a href="sect32.htm">turn to 32</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 6 or more, <a href="sect51.htm">turn to 51</a>.</p>
