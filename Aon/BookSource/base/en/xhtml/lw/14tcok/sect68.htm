<h3>68</h3>

<p>You hurry away from the dead Drakkarim and enter a tunnel which is dank and humid. You have taken less than a dozen paces when suddenly your senses alert you to a crude floor trap. A pit of poison-tipped stakes, concealed beneath a large square of oiled cloth, blocks the tunnel ahead. What would normally have ensnared a lesser warrior causes you little worry. With a single bound you clear the pit and continue on your way.</p>
<p>Soon the tunnel leads to another hall, but the entrance is blocked by a huge stone statue of Zagarna which has been tipped onto its side. The statue must have shattered on impact for the tunnel exit is almost filled with large boulders. In order to gain access to the hall beyond, you must first clear away some of this heavy debris.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. Now subtract 1 from the number you have picked. The resultant score equals the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost due to fatigue. (If you picked 0 or 1, your score is zero.)</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="sect100.htm">Turn to 100</a>.</p>
