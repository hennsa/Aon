<h3>95</h3>

<p>You draw your weapon and support your friend with your free hand. You tell him what you have sensed, that there is a strong chance that an ambush awaits you in the pen, but he agrees with you that a sudden rush towards the landing platform stands a good chance of success. Then, with a nod of your head, you indicate the Zlanbeast that is perched outside on the platform and whisper to Banedon that that particular creature is the one that will soon be carrying you out of Kaag. He nods his approval and you get ready to enter the pen.</p>
<p>You have taken less than five steps towards the platform when an unexpected sound makes you look up. To your horror, you see a weighted net falling from the ceiling directly onto your heads.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you have Grand Huntmastery and have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian, add 3 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 0–4, <a href="sect27.htm">turn to 27</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5 or more, <a href="sect262.htm">turn to 262</a>.</p>
