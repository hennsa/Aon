<h3>180</h3>

<p>With lightning speed you draw and fire two Arrows, sending the shafts whistling deep into the scaly bellies of the two swamp creatures. Their effect is swift and deadly; the Ciquali screech in unison and throw their arms wide as they are hurled backwards into the mire. You string another Arrow and glance over your shoulder at your companion who, having lost his sword, is now grappling with a Ciquali in a desperate hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>The fight is going badly for Prarg. The creature is by far the largest of the pack and much of its muscular body is protected by armour, crudely fashioned from human bones. Anxious to help your companion, you raise your Bow and take aim, but the two are entwined and you dare not fire for fear of hitting the captain. Then a sudden swipe of the creature’s horny fist knocks Prarg to his knees, allowing you a moment’s unobstructed view of his adversary.</p>
<p>(Remember to erase three Arrows from your Quiver.)</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to fire at the creature’s head, <a href="sect111.htm">turn to 111</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to fire at the sac which surrounds the creature’s throat, <a href="sect38.htm">turn to 38</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to fire at the creature’s upper chest, <a href="sect228.htm">turn to 228</a>.</p>
