<h3>204</h3>

<p>A bold idea springs to mind. Using your Kai Discipline, you cause your facial features to take on the harsh countenance of a Drakkarim warrior. At first Prarg is alarmed by your dramatic change and he steps back aghast, but you quickly reassure him that the effect is temporary; it is part of your plan to gain entry to the temple.</p>
<p>Prarg will act as your prisoner while you pretend to be a Drakkarim guard, summoned from Shugkona by Warlord Magnaarn himself. Prarg agrees to the plan and he places his hands behind his back, as if they are tied, and you escort him towards the temple doors. As you approach the two guards you call out to them, speaking in Giak, saying that Warlord Magnaarn has sent for this prisoner. Visibly they hesitate. They have no knowledge of their master’s request and are suspicious. As you ascend the ramp, one of the guards levels his spear and points it threateningly at your chest.</p>
