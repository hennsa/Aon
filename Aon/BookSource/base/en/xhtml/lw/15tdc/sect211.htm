<h3>211</h3>

<p>You rush towards your stricken companion, unshouldering your Backpack as you run. Once you are as close to the hole as you dare go, you tear open the pack and take out your coiled rope. Prarg is foundering in the icy water; he can barely keep his head above the surface. Hurriedly you hurl one end of the rope towards him and he makes a desperate grab for it with numbed fingers. Miraculously he grips it first time and manages to hold on tight as you haul him out of the freezing water.</p>
<p>His skin is violet and his entire body is shaking uncontrollably. Using your healing skills, you transmit some of your body warmth through your hands to his chest and face and, within a few minutes, he comes out of his state of shock and his body returns to its normal temperature. Your prompt action has saved his life, but it has also drained you of 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
