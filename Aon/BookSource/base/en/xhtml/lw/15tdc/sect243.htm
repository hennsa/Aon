<h3>243</h3>

<p>At last you strike the killing blow that sends this evil amphibian spiralling down to the bottom of the frigid lake. Once free of its grip, you take hold of Prarg’s tunic and pull him towards the jagged hole in the ice. Then, with great difficulty, you climb out of the water and haul your unconscious companion to safety. His skin is deep violet, he is barely breathing, and his entire body is shaking uncontrollably. Using your healing skills, you transmit some of your body warmth through your hands to his chest and face and, within a few minutes, he comes out of his state of shock as his body returns to its normal temperature. Your prompt action has saved his life, but it has also drained you of 5 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p class="choice">Make the necessary adjustments to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> and <a href="sect157.htm">turn to 157</a>.</p>
