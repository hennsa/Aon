<h3>245</h3>

<p>You dispatch the Drakkarim with deadly precision. Then you hide their bodies in a nearby hovel, just in case their comrades should notice their absence and care enough to come looking for them. You are keen to leave this place but, before you go, you notice that one of them is wearing a hooded leather cloak which could help you get inside the town. It is big enough to hide your Kai tunic and, when pulled up, the hood hides your face completely.</p>
<p>Wrapped totally in this cloak, you approach the main gates. The guards are busy admitting the latest batch of prisoners and they do not give you a second glance as you stride confidently into the town. Once inside, you head towards a dark, deserted alleyway which is sandwiched between a stables and an armoury. From here you observe the compound with a growing anger and pity for those trapped inside. Stirred by their plight, you vow to help these starving men. Patiently you watch and wait for the patrols to pass; then you scurry towards the compound fence, eager to make contact with the Lencians.</p>
