<h3>250</h3>

<p>The sound of a dog growling loudly in your ear stirs you to sudden wakefulness. Instinctively you reach for your weapon, but as you do so, a set of sharp fangs closes about your wrist: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Fiercely you struggle to free yourself from the vice-tight jaws of an Akataz. The war-dog hangs on to your wrist with grim determination until a blow to its neck with the edge of your left hand kills it instantly. As its body drops to the snow, you unsheathe your weapon and call out to Prarg. He replies, but his voice is distant and filled with desperation. You climb the river bank, cursing yourself for allowing your guide to take the first watch. Overcome by fatigue he must have fallen asleep, allowing a pack of marauding Akataz to fall upon you without warning.</p>
<p>As you crest the bank, you see Prarg stabbing and slashing with his sword, fighting like a wild man to save himself from a dozen of the snapping, snarling war-dogs.</p>
<p>‘Quickly, Prarg!’ you shout, as you rush to his aid. ‘Stand back-to-back. Don’t let them separate us or you’re done for!’</p>
<p class="combat">Wild Akataz Pack: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 40   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 55</p>
<p>These war-dogs are especially susceptible to psychic attack. Double all bonuses you would normally receive should you decide to use a psychic attack during this combat.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect176.htm">turn to 176</a>.</p>
