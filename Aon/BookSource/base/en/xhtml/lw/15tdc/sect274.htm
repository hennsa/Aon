<h3>274</h3>

<p>You follow the tunnel for a mile further until it opens into a vast underground cistern. Slimy water splashes down the slick sides of this vertical shaft to mix with the rushing river before disappearing into a whirlpool which is swirling at its centre. The noise here is almost unbearable and you look around for some means of escape. The walkway ends at a rusty iron ladder which is cemented into the wall and ascends the shaft for as far as you can see. Slowly you climb this ladder, testing every rung carefully before trusting it to your weight.</p>
<p>You climb for an hour before reaching the entrance to a man-sized tunnel set into the wall of the shaft. Here you leave the ladder and follow this damp passageway until you come to a small, smooth-walled chamber. At first it appears to be raining; then you notice that the ceiling is badly broken and water is dripping constantly from the cracks. Opposite the tunnel exit there is a stone door. Anxious to escape, you hurry across the chamber and place your shoulder to this heavy portal in an attempt to force it open, but unfortunately it is locked. Then you detect something unusual, an acrid burning smell. Your heart skips a beat when suddenly you realize that your cloak and tunic are smouldering and giving off wisps of bluish smoke. The fluid raining from the ceiling is not water at all—it is corrosive acid!</p>
