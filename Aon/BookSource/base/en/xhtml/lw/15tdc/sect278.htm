<h3>278</h3>

<p>You ship the oars and take aim with your bow at the pot-bellied leader of this band of lowly Drakkarim renegades. For a moment your eyes meet and instantly his nerve shatters when he realizes that he is your chosen target. He drops his bow and turns to run, but it does not save him; your Arrow still finds its mark. As he throws his hands to the sky and tumbles lifelessly into the river, panic breaks out among his motley followers. Any attempt to fire at you is soon forgotten as they scramble desperately up the muddy bank and flee for the safety of the hills.</p>
<p>Your voyage continues without interruption until, later in the afternoon, you catch sight of a town on the horizon. You check your <a href="map.htm">map</a> and discover it to be Konozod, a fortified Drakkarim stronghold. As the river carries you closer, you magnify your vision and see that it is built upon the left bank of the Shug. A huge stone bridge spans the river, and beneath this you see that the waterway is blocked by a barrier of chained logs.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to allow your boat to drift towards this barrier, <a href="sect314.htm">turn to 314</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to avoid the barrier, you can put ashore and continue on foot by <a href="sect231.htm">turning to 231</a>.</p>
