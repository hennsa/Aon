<h3>3</h3>

<p>You deal the ice a mighty blow and it splits wide open. For a moment you fear you are already too late to save your guide; then suddenly his head bobs out of the icy water and you grab hold of his collar before he disappears once again.</p>
<p>You haul him out of the lake and lay him on the frozen surface. His skin is a deep shade of violet and his entire body is shaking uncontrollably. You know that he is in serious condition but at least he is still alive. Using your healing skills, you transmit some of your body warmth through your hands to his chest and face and, within a few minutes, he comes out of shock and his body returns to its normal temperature. Your prompt action has saved his life, but it has also drained you of 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p class="choice">Adjust your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score accordingly and then <a href="sect157.htm">turn to 157</a>.</p>
