<h3>335</h3>

<p>A hundred paces further along the tunnel, you turn a corner and find yourself face-to-face with a ghastly creature. From out of the gloom comes a lumbering hulk with hungry scarlet eyes. This beast is covered with vile fur which glistens in the eerie half-light of the tunnel, and its long sinewy arms are outstretched as if it is sleepwalking. But this beast is not asleep. In both of its huge hands it holds chunks of dagger-like flint which it wields like weapons. Its bloated belly skims the floor as it gathers speed, and a brown gluey saliva runs freely from its fanged lower jaw.</p>
<p>With a shriek, the creature lunges towards you, flailing at the air with its brace of dagger-flints as it closes in for the kill. You are forced to retreat as it comes rushing towards you at a breathtaking pace.</p>
