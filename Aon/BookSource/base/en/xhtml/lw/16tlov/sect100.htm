<h3>100</h3>

<p>You follow the President into the chamber, your footsteps echoing as you walk across the mosaic marble floor. At the far end of the room a wiry wolfhound lies snoozing in front of a log fire which is crackling in an iron grate. The flames illuminate the chamber with a warm glow, casting flickering shadows across countless shelves stacked with thick rolls of parchment and papyrus. At the centre there stands a large table heaped with sand. The sand has been shaped to depict the topography of Magador, its towns, cities, mountains, hills, and rivers. The attention to detail is most impressive.</p>
<p>‘Somewhere, here, I fear there is a great evil at work,’ says Kadharian, pointing to a section of the table which depicts the territory north of Lake Vorndarol, an area uncomfortably close to the deep furrow which represents the Maakengorge.</p>
<p>‘Three moons ago, the lakeside hamlet of Vorn was reportedly destroyed by an unnatural storm, the first of many that have continuously swept the region. I dispatched a troop of my guards to investigate but they never returned. Since then, a second troop has also disappeared without trace.’</p>
<p>‘But what makes you think that a plot to resurrect Vashna is afoot?’ you reply, trying not to sound overly sceptical. ‘With due respect, President, this is a notorious region infested with renegades and brigands. There may be a far simpler explanation for the destruction of Vorn and the disappearance of your troops.’</p>
<p>‘Aye, ’tis so,’ retorts Kadharian. ‘At first, I too made the same assumption. But then I came into the possession of something which made me believe otherwise.’</p>
<p>From a leather pouch hanging from his sword belt, Kadharian takes an item which is neatly wrapped in a square of patterned silk.</p>
<p>‘Here, Grand Master,’ he says, offering it to you, ‘I’ll let you draw your own conclusions from this.’</p>
