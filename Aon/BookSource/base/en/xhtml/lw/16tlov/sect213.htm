<h3>213</h3>

<p>You level the Deathstaff at the Arch Druid, and say, ‘This is the key to the resurrection of Vashna; without it your Demoness will be powerless to summon him.’</p>
<p>Cadak laughs, sneering at your words. ‘And how long do you think you will keep it from her, Kai Lord? Did you think that the Demoness Shamath will have difficulty taking it from you? No, she will not. You are doomed, Lone Wolf. Why don’t you admit it? You were doomed the moment you returned from the great arch.’</p>
<p>Your hatred for the evil druid wells up and you suddenly feel a tingling sensation engulf your hands. Your emotion has activated the power of the Deathstaff and, without warning, a swirling cone of grey vapour emerges from its tip and coils towards Cadak. He yelps with shocked surprise and raises his staff to fend off the attack. He is successful, but at great cost to his magical stamina.</p>
<p>You, too, feel the draining effect of this accursed staff (lose 7 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points) and your Kai senses scream a warning not to use it again in combat for fear of the consequences. Next time you could lose more than <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points—you could lose your soul!</p>
