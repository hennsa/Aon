<h3>251</h3>

<p>The tip of your Arrow clips the man’s calf and you hear him yelp with pain. But the wound is superficial and it does not prevent him from making his escape out onto the balcony.</p>
<p>With weapon in hand, you climb out of the window. You are expecting the archer to attack you the moment you appear but the balcony is deserted: he has disappeared. Then your keen eyes notice fresh bloodstains on the balcony rail and you catch a glimpse of movement on the roof of the building opposite. It is the archer. Despite his wounded leg he has leapt across the narrow street and is now making his escape across the rooftops of the north quarter.</p>
<p>With the grace of a panther you spring onto the balcony rail and leap across to the roof opposite. Without breaking your stride, you set off after the fleeing assassin and pursue him to the edge of a flat-topped warehouse at the end of Tavern Lane. Here a plank of wood has been laid down to span the gap of fifty feet to the rooftop opposite. The man limps across the plank, and then kicks it away to prevent you from following him.</p>
<p class="choice">If you are determined to follow him and wish to try to leap across the gap, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to make the jump, <a href="sect191.htm">turn to 191</a>.</p>
