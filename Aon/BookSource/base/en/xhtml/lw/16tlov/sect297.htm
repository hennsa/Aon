<h3>297</h3>

<p>You thank Gwynian for his help and he waves farewell as you leave the hovel and walk back to your horse.</p>
<p>‘Good luck, Grand Master,’ he calls out. ‘My hopes and my prayers go with you.’</p>
<p>By nightfall you have covered twenty miles of rough terrain and have been assailed by extremes of weather. From a desert-like heat at mid-afternoon the temperature plummeted, causing a sub-zero squall which left you and Bracer blanketed with frost. But now, as darkness draws its cloak over this troubled land, the temperature quickly rises. This heralds the return of the rain, and the thunder and the violent lightning strikes.</p>
<p>Helped by your tracking skills, you discover a shallow cave where you can take shelter from the storm. You are tired and hungry, and unless you possess Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Animal Mastery and have attained the rank of Kai Grand Guardian or higher, <a href="sect194.htm">turn to 194</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this Discipline, or if you have yet to achieve this level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect23.htm">turn to 23</a>.</p>
