<h3>315</h3>

<p>Immediately you recognize the tall, muscular man who stands before you now; he was once known as the Slavemaster of Aarnak. He was an agent of the Elder Magi based in the Darklands who, seven years earlier, helped you to enter the dread city of Helgedad and bring about the downfall of the Darklords. Now he is known by a different name—President Kadharian of Magador.</p>
<p>‘Welcome, Grand Master,’ he says, smiling warmly. ‘It seems we have both come a long way since our last meeting.’</p>
<p>The President is amused by your expression of surprise and offers an explanation of how he came to be leader of this rough republic. After the fall of Helgedad, the Elder Magi arranged for his safe passage to the Stornlands where he was granted a command in the army of Lyris. He distinguished himself in battle and later, once the remains of the Darkland armies had been vanquished, he returned to his native Magador and led an uprising against King Vanagrom VI, who had long been a puppet of the Darklords. The revolt ended with the King’s death and the abolition of the monarchy. Magador became a republic and the Slavemaster, whose given name was Kadharian, became its first elected leader.</p>
<p>‘And now to the reasons why I have requested your help, Grand Master,’ he says, as he pushes open the door to a smaller room which adjoins the senate hall.</p>
