<h3>45</h3>

<p>Gwynian opens his envelope and removes a time-yellowed parchment which he spreads upon the smooth stone table: it is a map of northern Magador. He points to Lake Vorndarol and tells you that the eye of the strange storms which have swept this region has been calculated to be within a few miles of the lake’s eastern shore, close to the Maakengorge. The hamlet of Vorn, or what is left of it, is located on the southern shore, near to a tributary of the River Storn. He counsels you to be on your guard at all times and, to help you succeed, he gives you an amulet of his own.</p>
<p>‘Wear this, Grand Master,’ he says as he places the corded platinum disc around your neck. ‘It will keep you safe from some of the perils that may await you at the Maakengorge.’</p>
<p>(Record this Platinum Amulet, which you wear on a cord around your neck, as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. You need not discard another item in its favour if you are already carrying the maximum number permissible.)</p>
