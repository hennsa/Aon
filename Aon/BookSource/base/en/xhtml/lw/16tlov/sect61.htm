<h3>61</h3>

<p>Your ascent into the foothills is slowed by the difficult terrain. Thousands of huge granite boulders litter the hillside, forcing the trail to zigzag constantly on its way towards a wooded peak, less than five miles distant. The weather turns bitterly cold as you make the climb and, although you are protected by your innate ability of Nexus, your horse is not so fortunate. It takes you over two hours to reach the wooded peak, but you are rewarded with a spectacular view of Lake Vorndarol.</p>
<p>The descent from the peak is far easier. The trail is wide and less tortuous, and the peak itself protects you and your horse from the icy winds that are blowing in off the lake. You have gone a little over a mile when suddenly your Pathsmanship skills alert you to danger; you sense that there is an ambush ahead. You turn off the trail and dismount, leaving your horse tied to a boulder, while you scout the way ahead on foot. You draw your weapon and keep it to hand in case you should happen once more upon some skulking brigands.</p>
<p>Soon you arrive at a granite outcrop which overlooks a small clearing among the boulders below. In the centre of this clearing lies the carcass of a wild boar.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to descend to the clearing and examine the carcass more closely, <a href="sect17.htm">turn to 17</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather wait here and observe the clearing from a distance, <a href="sect88.htm">turn to 88</a>.</p>
