<h3>9</h3>

<p>With weapon in hand, you climb out of the window. You are expecting the archer to attack you the moment you appear, but the balcony is deserted: he has disappeared. Then your keen eyes catch a glimpse of movement on the roof of a building opposite. It is the archer. He has leapt the narrow street from the rail of the balcony and he is now making his escape across the rooftops of the north quarter.</p>
<p>With the grace of a springing panther, you leap from the balcony and land on the roof opposite. Without breaking your stride, you set off after the fleeing assassin and pursue him to the edge of a flat-topped warehouse at the end of Tavern Lane. Here a plank of wood had been laid down to span the gap of ten yards to the rooftop opposite. The man makes a sure-footed escape across the plank, and then kicks it away to prevent you from following him.</p>
<p class="choice">If you are determined to follow him and wish to try to leap across the gap, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to make the jump, <a href="sect191.htm">turn to 191</a>.</p>
