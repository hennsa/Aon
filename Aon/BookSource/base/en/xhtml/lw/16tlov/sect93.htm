<h3>93</h3>

<p>With the returning acolytes aboard, an Elder gives the order that the grappling lines and planks—which hold the longboat secure to the Vakovarian ship—be cut and tossed into the lake. The moment this is done, the three Elders raise their glowing wands of power and touch them together to form a triangle.</p>
<p>There is a flash of greenish light and a swirling cone of vapour coils into the sky, pouring from the tip of this triangle. It creates a howling wind which fills the sails and catapults the longboat away from the quayside at tremendous speed. It takes just a few minutes for the ruins of Vorn to disappear over the horizon.</p>
<p>Aboard the longboat the victorious acolytes busy themselves as the cold waters of Lake Vorndarol speed by beneath the keel. Some are attending to those who were wounded in the battle; others are chanting a sombre dirge or sitting quietly with their heads bowed, lost in unholy prayer; the remainder clean their weapons or stare vacantly at the distant mountains.</p>
<p>You keep your head bowed and pretend to be praying. The deception seems to be working until a hand suddenly grips your shoulder and you hear a gruff voice bark a command in a language you do not readily understand.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Grand Pathsmanship,<sup><a href="#sect93-1-foot" name="sect93-1">10</a></sup> <a href="sect243.htm">turn to 243</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this Discipline, <a href="sect184.htm">turn to 184</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect93-1-foot" href="#sect93-1">10</a>] Kai Masters who have attained the rank of Scion-kai are ‘able to converse with any sentient creature’ (cf. <cite><a href="../12tmod/imprvdsc.htm">The Masters of Darkness</a></cite>).
