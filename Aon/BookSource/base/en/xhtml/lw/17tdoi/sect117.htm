<h3>117</h3>

<p>Lanza is a stocky, hard-nosed soldier whose leathery, frost-bitten face bears living testimony to the five years he has spent as commander of this bleak, godforsaken outpost. His posting here had been his punishment for a drunken brawl in a Vadera tavern in which he had killed, albeit in self-defence, the brutish elder son of Haglar, the mayor of the city. At his court-martial he had been allowed to choose his fate—command of the notorious Azgad Island garrison, or death by hanging. Lanza readily admits that there have been times when he has felt that he made the wrong choice.</p>
<p>Lanza’s private quarters comprise a sparsely-furnished chamber near the top of the watchtower. You warm yourself in front of an open grate and listen as he and Prarg discuss your onward passage to Ixia aboard the garrison’s ice-boat. At length, Lanza voices his fears about recent sightings at sea—strange craft which sail beneath the waves and ships crewed by the living dead. As you listen to his chilling account, you look out through the chamber’s slit window at an icy mist which is creeping in from the north. It swirls knee-deep around the watchtower and the harbour wall.</p>
