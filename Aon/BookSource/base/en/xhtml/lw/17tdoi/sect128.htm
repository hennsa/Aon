<h3>128</h3>

<p>You stare at the spiked helm and a strange sense of purpose forms in your mind. You know that this artefact is wholly Evil, yet you have the curious notion that it could also be put to use in the cause of Good. Your Kai instincts tell you that this helm was forged and fashioned by Naar, the Dark God, and that its power is such that it can destroy most beings, living or dead. It may even be powerful enough to destroy Deathlord Ixiataaga.</p>
<p>You pick up the helm and, with a swift and violent action, you smash it onto the ground. The crystal spike snaps cleanly from the top of the helm and you stow it in your belt. (Record this Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Power Spike, which you carry in your belt. If you already carry the maximum number of Special Items permissible, you must discard another in favour of this one.)</p>
<p>Resolutely, you turn and walk towards the Shadow Gate. As you leap into its spinning core, you pray that you will arrive back on Magnamund with time enough to thwart the Deathlord’s evil plan.</p>
