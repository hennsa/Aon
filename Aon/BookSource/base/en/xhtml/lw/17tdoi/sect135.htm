<h3>135</h3>

<p>The ghastly creature shrieks with undisguised glee as it prepares to strike you down. It raises its jagged rod of ice and sparks ignite at the tip—the prelude to another devastating blast of energy which the beast is about to aim at your crouching form. You reach for your own weapon, desperate to defend yourself, but as your hand closes around the hilt you hear the unexpected sound of rushing wind. Suddenly a spear-like missile hits the creature in the back and explodes from its chest. The impact sends the beast cartwheeling past you to slam into the ice-boat’s mast. You look towards the watchtower and see Prarg at the parapet, standing behind a catapult-like pantard, his clenched fist raised in triumph. You return his salute, thankful that his aim was true.</p>
<p>The pantard bolt has pinned the creature to the mast but it has not destroyed it. Howling with anger, it twists and writhes to get free. Then, as if drawn by its unhuman cries, a mass of skeletal warriors come charging down the gangplank towards you. Instinctively, you draw your weapon and strike the plank a mighty blow, splitting it cleanly in two. Both sections collapse and the onrushing skeletons tumble helplessly into the icy water.</p>
