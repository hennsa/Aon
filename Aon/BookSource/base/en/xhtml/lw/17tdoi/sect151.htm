<h3>151</h3>

<p>The advancing creature sees that you are preparing to strike the gangplank and quickly it retreats to the quayside. You deal the plank a mighty blow, splitting it cleanly in two, and both sections collapse and splash into the harbour’s freezing water. But the danger is not over.</p>
<p>The creature turns its icy rod around and points the blunt end towards your head. There is a brilliant flash of light and a guttering ball of flame comes speeding from the base of the rod towards your face. Your reflexes save you—you dive for cover behind a tool chest and the fireball whistles over your head to explode into the decking. Howling with anger, the creature launches a second fireball, but this one is not aimed at you—it is targeted at the ice-boat’s waterline. The deck shudders and flames leap up all around, spreading with unnatural speed. Within seconds you are engulfed by roaring flames.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to escape from this burning ship by jumping into the harbour, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to reach the quayside by swinging from the rigging, <a href="sect201.htm">turn to 201</a>.</p>
