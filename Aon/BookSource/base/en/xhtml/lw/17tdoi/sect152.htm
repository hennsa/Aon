<h3>152</h3>

<p>As the last skeletal warrior crumbles beneath your repeated blows, you step back and wipe the sweat of battle from your brow. A glance into the secret panel through which they emerged reveals a narrow chamber beyond. Lying on the crystal slab floor you see several items of equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small Sack</li>
<li>Stone Bowl</li>
<li>Spyglass</li>
<li>Iron Key</li>
<li>Coil of Oiled Rope</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to keep any of the above, record them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as Backpack Items.</p>
<p>You leave the chamber and hurry down the stone staircase to the archway below. The Drakkarim patrol you sighted earlier is now nowhere to be seen, enabling you to leave the barbican and enter Xaagon without further confrontation.</p>
<p>Warily you trek through the awesome ruins of this age-old city, where once, at the beginning of the Age of Eternal Night, a proud and mighty race reigned supreme.</p>
<p>You have just passed a derelict mausoleum when you are forced to halt and hide from a passing troop of Ixian warriors. You watch as they march stiffly along an ice-choked avenue towards a plaza that is dominated by a huge frozen fountain. Beyond the fountain’s solid plume of water you see a broad ramp which ascends to a grand archway at the base of the Crystal Spire.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Grand Huntmastery and have attained the Kai rank of Sun Lord or higher, <a href="sect9.htm">turn to 9</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to reach this level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect122.htm">turn to 122</a>.</p>
