<h3>162</h3>

<p>You reach the subterranean lake and go aboard an ice-boat moored alongside the stone jetty. With the demise of the Deathlord and his necromantic power, you are fearful that these vessels may no longer be serviceable; their sorcerous engines could prove to be as immobile as the warriors who stand like frozen statues all around the shore of the lake. But, fortunately, your fears turn out to be groundless.</p>
<p>You quickly discover that these ice-boats are propelled by Ixian witchcraft, an arcane art far older and more benign than the Deathlord’s vile necromancy. Having satisfied yourself that your chosen vessel is seaworthy, you cast off its hawser and steer it away from the jetty towards the wide cave mouth which opens out into the stormy Tozaz Sea. The elation of victory is still buoying your spirits, yet there is a nagging unease in the back of your mind that not everything is as it should be.</p>
