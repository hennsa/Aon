<h3>171</h3>

<p>When you regain consciousness, it seems as if you have been knocked out for no more than a few minutes, but as your mind clears you sense that you are still at sea, although no longer in the hold of the Ixian ice-boat. Countless hours, perhaps even days, could have elapsed since you were knocked out, and now you find yourself lying face down on the floor of a small dank cell. Instinctively you reach for your weapon—but it is no longer there. Your head throbs, your body aches viciously, and your mood is further soured when you discover that your Backpack, your Weapons, and all of your Special Items (with the exception of your Platinum Amulet) are missing.</p>
<p>You roll over wearily and drag yourself to your feet. You can hear noises in a distant part of this vessel and, when you intensify your hearing, you become aware that this mysterious craft is slowing down as if in preparation to dock. Anxious to escape, and doubly anxious to retrieve your missing equipment, you step towards the door of the cell.</p>
