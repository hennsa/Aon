<h3>18</h3>

<p>You leave the Ixian ship and go in search of Captain Lanza. You find him with his men by the watchtower—they are building a bonfire out of rags and broken bones. A toothless sergeant empties a gallon of skark oil onto the heap and a burning torch sets the whole thing ablaze.</p>
<p>You stride over to Lanza and slap him heartily on the back. ‘Well fought, captain. You and your men have brought honour to Lencia this day.’</p>
<p>Captain Lanza greets your compliment with a sombre face. ‘Nay, sire,’ he says, sadly. ‘ ’Tis the enemy who’ve won. The ice-boat is sunk and we cannot sail you to Ixia.’</p>
<p>‘We can use the enemy ship, Captain,’ you reply. ‘It is perfect for the task. All I need of you are some provisions and a crew.’</p>
<p>Lanza’s face brightens. He orders his men to prepare the Ixian ship and within the hour you are ready to set sail.</p>
<p>‘May the gods watch over you, Grand Master,’ says Prarg, as you bid him and Lanza farewell.</p>
<p>‘Do not fear,’ you reply. ‘I shall soon return.’</p>
