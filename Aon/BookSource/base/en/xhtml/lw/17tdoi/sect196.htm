<h3>196</h3>

<p>You flee the chamber, escaping past many Ixian and Drakkarim guards who stand rigidly immobile, fixed in the poses and attitudes they were in the very moment you vanquished the Deathlord. It was his power which gave them un-life; now that power is no more.</p>
<p>Fearing for your survival, you sprint across heaving, buckling slabs of broken stone that were once smooth tiled floors, and rush down staircases that crack and twist beneath your feet. You are racing down one such stairwell when suddenly an entire section collapses, leaving a gaping hole more than fifty feet deep. Above you, a row of pillars topple like storm-shaken trees, blocking the stairs completely, and making it impossible for you to retrace your steps.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and have attained the Kai rank of Sun Thane, <a href="sect29.htm">turn to 29</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Telegnosis and have attained the Kai rank of Sun Lord or higher, <a href="sect326.htm">turn to 326</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess either of these Disciplines, or if you have yet to attain the relevant levels of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect225.htm">turn instead to 225</a>.</p>
