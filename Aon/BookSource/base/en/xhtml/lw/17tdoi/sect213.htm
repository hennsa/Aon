<h3>213</h3>

<p>The bodies of the ghastly creatures undergo a swift and gruesome transformation upon the instant you deal them the  <i xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</i>. Their torsos implode with dramatic effect, and they barely have time to cry out in agony as their twisted remains hit the floor and crumble to dust.</p>
<p>You sheathe your weapon and step away from the foul-smelling mounds of dust. But as you go to leave, you discover that the open archway that these creatures were guarding when you first arrived in this chamber is now sealed. You approach the solid sheet of opaque green crystal and examine an intricate lockplate which is set in the centre of its mirror-smooth surface. It is a lock of ancient design, one which operates by psychic energy. You study the intricate patterns which embellish it and gradually you realize that they give clues to a two-digit number. By projecting the image of this number at the lock, using your psychic powers, you will release the locking mechanism and cause the portal to open.</p>
<p>The first of the two numbers is equal to the number of islands which lie within 150 miles to the west of Xaagon.</p>
<p>The second number is equal to the number of cities and towns which can be found located in the Shegtar Peaks.</p>
<p class="puzzle">Consult the <a href="map.htm">map</a> in order to determine the correct two-digit number which will open the lock. When you think you have cracked it, <a href="numbered.htm">turn to the entry</a> that bears that same number as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect213-1-foot" name="sect213-1">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you calculate incorrectly, or if you cannot solve the clues, <a href="sect199.htm">turn instead to 199</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect213-1-foot" href="#sect213-1">12</a>] The section corresponding to the correct answer will have a footnote confirming that it is indeed correct. You have only one chance to guess at the correct answer. If you guess incorrectly, <a href="sect199.htm">turn immediately to 199</a>.</p></div>
