<h3>220</h3>

<p>‘Give me your Weapon, Grand Master,’ says Banedon, holding out his hand expectantly. You unsheathe your hand-weapon and pass it to him hilt-first. From a pocket he takes out a dull red gem, no bigger than a fig stone, and presses it gently against the hilt of your Weapon. To your surprise, you see the gem sink into the hilt as easily as if Banedon were pressing it into a pat of warm butter.</p>
<p>‘The gem is a Dessi Stone,’ says Banedon, in answer to your unspoken question. ‘Lord Rimoah gave it to me. Now, I give it to you. Whenever you use this Weapon in combat against a non-living foe, the power of the Dessi Stone will help you achieve swift victory.’ Banedon returns your Weapon and you examine the Dessi Stone carefully for a few moments before sheathing it in your belt.</p>
<p>With the Dessi Stone fitted into its hilt, your Weapon now inflicts double <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point losses against an undead opponent in combat. Be sure to record this permanent modification to your Weapon on your <a href="action.htm">Weapons List</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect22.htm">turn to 22</a>.</p>
