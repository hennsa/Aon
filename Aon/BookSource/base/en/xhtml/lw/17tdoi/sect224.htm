<h3>224</h3>

<p>You take the ship’s wheel and turn this alien vessel out of the narrow harbour, into the roiling waters of the Tozaz Sea. It is less than an hour past noon and yet the winter night has already closed in. You share the icy darkness with a crew of six Lencian outposters, all of whom have volunteered for this perilous mission. Lanza has ordered them to land you on the coast of Ixia and wait at anchor for seven days for you to return; they must wait no longer.</p>
<p>With ten miles of sea behind you, you hand over the wheel to one of the crew and settle down on the wheelhouse floor to sleep. But you have barely closed your eyes when the deck begins to buck like a stallion. The ship has sailed directly into a <i xml:lang="">saesha</i>—a sudden and violent sea-storm for which the Tozaz is infamous. Thunder roars and sleet blows with blinding ferocity as the ship dips and rolls in the waves.</p>
<p>After what seems like an eternity, the ship emerges from the storm—a storm against which few craft other than this could have sailed. The darkness gives way to an eerie dawn which casts its watery light upon a new danger. In the grey half-light you see thousands of icebergs ahead, stretching across the horizon as far as the eye can see. Your heart sinks—navigating a course through this icy maze could well prove impossible.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take control of the ship’s wheel as you approach the field of icebergs, <a href="sect51.htm">turn to 51</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to go forward to the prow and act as ship’s pilot, <a href="sect189.htm">turn to 189</a>.</p>
