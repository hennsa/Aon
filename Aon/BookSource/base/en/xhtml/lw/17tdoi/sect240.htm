<h3>240</h3>

<p>You advance slowly along the slippery foredeck towards steps which ascend to the raised stern of this alien vessel. Every inch of its coal-black timbers is decorated with strange and intricate carvings, and archaic symbols embellish the metal rails which encircle its gunwales. Drawing on your Grand Master Disciplines, you determine that this vessel was not constructed by the unhuman creatures who crewed it, but that it is an ancient ship, built and crafted by a race of mariners who have long since disappeared into the mists of time. Closer examination of the timbers reveals it to be more than eleven thousand years old.</p>
<p>You climb to the wheelhouse, which stands in the centre of the stern deck, and discover there a large, glassy sphere mounted upon an ornate base of glittering black stone. A low hum and a faint greenish glow radiate from this sphere, which in turn is connected by silver tubes and strands of braided metal to the wheel which steers the craft. After careful study of the controls you feel confident that you could sail the vessel.</p>
<p>Prarg enters the wheelhouse and announces that, having thoroughly searched the bow and below deck areas, he is sure that it is empty—no hidden enemies are lurking aboard.</p>
<p>‘Well, Grand Master,’ he continues, staring bemusedly at the strange workings of this craft, ‘this is a rum craft and no mistake. Are you sure it can carry you to Ixia?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I’m sure,’ you reply. ‘In fact I’m certain that it will be safer to sail the Tozaz in this ship than to attempt the crossing in any ice-boat bearing the Lencian flag.’</p>
<p>Prarg looks out of the wheelhouse window at the sunken remains of the ice-boat, and says: ‘I hope you’re right, Grand Master. I sincerely hope you’re right.’</p>
