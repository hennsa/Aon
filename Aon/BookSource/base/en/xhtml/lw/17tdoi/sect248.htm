<h3>248</h3>

<p>Having heard your question, King Sarnac turns to Ardan and says: ‘My lord, perhaps you could say something to allay Grand Master Lone Wolf’s fears?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly, sire,’ replies Lord Ardan, turning to address you.</p>
<p>‘My lord, as Guildmaster Banedon may already have told you, the coast of Ixia is a hellish place. The ice-boat will be able to anchor in this region for seven days at most. If you do not return within this time, it will be forced to go back to Azgad Island. But do not let this cause you undue concern, my lord. At present there is a great imbalance between the forces of Good and Evil in our world, yet upon the instant that you defeat the Deathlord and destroy his staff of power, this balance will surely be resumed. I, like my kinsman Lord Rimoah, will know the moment that the balance has been righted. If your quest takes longer than one week to accomplish, the ice-boat will be sent out once more to collect you from Xaagon.’</p>
