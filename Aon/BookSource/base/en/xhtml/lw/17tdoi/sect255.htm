<h3>255</h3>

<p>You steer the ship cautiously along a string of narrow fjords which cut an uncertain route through this treacherous field of icebergs. Your hands, slick with nervous sweat, grip the wheel tightly and inch it back and forth in response to the pilot’s frantic signals. It is a gruelling ordeal which takes its toll on the nerves of all aboard. Every few minutes your vision is obscured by gusts of powdery snow which swirl across the deck, blown down from the tops of the surrounding ice cliffs. During one of these fierce blasts you lose sight of the pilot and are forced to rely solely upon your Kai instincts to see you through.</p>
<p>Suddenly the incessant howl of the wind is accompanied by the tortured screech of the hull as it skims a bank of submerged ice. The impact sends the ship careering violently to port and hurls you head-first against the wall of the wheelhouse: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
