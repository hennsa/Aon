<h3>258</h3>

<p>Patiently you attempt to manipulate the lock mechanism using the power of your mind alone. Your patience is finally rewarded by a loud <i>click</i>, and the ice-caked door creaks slowly open.</p>
<p>Beyond it you see a dark and empty corridor. Before leaving the cell you pause for a few moments to use your skill of Nexus once more, in an attempt to determine the location of your missing weapons and equipment. You sense they are distant but, guided by these feelings, you enter the corridor and go in search of them.</p>
<p>The dingy corridor wends its way deeper into the bowels of this vast alien vessel. You explore a maze of empty holds, where the walls are braced with gleaming crystal girders, and pass through low-ceilinged chambers that, despite the biting chill, reek of death and decay. At length your search ends at a great grey door which is guarded by two undead Drakkarim warriors, armed with spears. The noises you heard earlier have now ceased, and so has the movement of the vessel; you sense that this craft is no longer at sea.</p>
<p>From the cover of a curving crystal bulkhead, you spy upon the Drakkarim guards while you consider your next move.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attack the guards with your bare hands, <a href="sect243.htm">turn to 243</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose instead to use your Magnakai mind Disciplines upon the guards, <a href="sect336.htm">turn to 336</a>.</p>
