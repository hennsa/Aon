<h3>270</h3>

<p>Soon you stumble upon a ruined watchtower where you stop to rest awhile and get your bearings. Through a hole in the tower’s dull, glassy wall, you can see the wide stone ramp which services the archway entrance of the great Crystal Spire. Hidden from sight, you observe the traffic of undead warriors passing through this grand archway. The low hum that you detected earlier is much louder here, almost painfully so. Its concussive vibration is so strong that it leaves ripples in the snow.</p>
<p>You crane your neck to look at the uppermost tip of the spire, and you shiver with dread when you detect the unmistakable presence of the Deathlord. His cloying aura of evil makes you break out in a cold sweat, but you fight back this fear and resolve to gain entry to the Crystal Spire; you are determined to defeat him. Patiently you wait, crouched in the rubble of the ruined watchtower, observing his undead slaves come and go. During this time, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
