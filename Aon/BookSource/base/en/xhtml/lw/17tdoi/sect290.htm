<h3>290</h3>

<p>Your final blow draws a hellish shriek from the skull of Deathlord Ixiataaga, so loud that it batters the walls and shakes the plinth on which you stand. The Deathstaff disintegrates in his skeletal hand and he topples backwards towards the fiery moat. Yet as he does so, his body crumbles into a plume of grey-green dust which is sucked away into the whirling maw of the Shadow Gate, together with the shattering remnants of the Deathstaff.</p>
<p>Your victory over the Deathlord has freed Ixia from an evil which has enslaved its dead for millennia. Now, at last, their tormented souls can find a lasting peace. You have destroyed a great and evil entity, yet by doing so you have also unwittingly removed the power which has kept the ravages of time at bay for thousands of years. Now, time returns to Xaagon.</p>
<p>Eager to leave this place, you leap across the fiery moat and run towards the archway. But as you are passing through it, there is a terrific explosion which shakes the very foundations of the Crystal Spire. Fear grips your heart when suddenly you realize that all of Xaagon is collapsing.</p>
