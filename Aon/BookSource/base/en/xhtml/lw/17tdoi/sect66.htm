<h3>66</h3>

<p>You throw out your arms in a desperate attempt to arrest your fall, but it does you no good. You hit the sea face-first and slam your head and left shoulder against a ridge of solid ice that lies submerged just a few inches below the slushy surface: lose 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>The frigid water is shockingly cold but you are oblivious to its numbing chill. Your Magnakai skill of Nexus, and the concussion which you have sustained due to the fall, account for that. Stunned and helpless, it is only the speedy action of the crew which saves you from being crushed between the hull of the ship and the harsh, unyielding ice. With a noose of oiled rope, a couple of crewmen swiftly retrieve you from the sea and haul you back onto the deck. Dazed but undaunted, you free yourself from the rope and scramble back to the prow.</p>
<p>‘Hard a’port!’ you yell, waving frantically to the helmsman. He responds immediately, and within a few minutes the ship is free of the ice-bank and safe in deep water.</p>
<p>Some of the crew, clearly terrified by the collision and the subsequent sight of you falling overboard, are cowering along the ship’s rail like frightened puppies. They stare up at the encroaching walls of ice, their eyes full of fear as they pray feverishly to the Goddess Ishir to save their souls. Then, almost without any warning, the snowy wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg fjord into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea. As one, the crew give a hearty cheer, relieved that their ordeal has at last come to an end. One man pulls the cork from a bottle of black rum which he has been keeping for a special occasion. He takes a mighty swig, and then hands the frosted bottle to you. Just as you are about to take a swallow, unexpectedly you hear the helmsman’s voice echoing along the deck: ‘Ship ahoy!’</p>
<p>Fear returns to tie a knot in your stomach as you turn and focus your eagle eyes upon the distant vessel.</p>
