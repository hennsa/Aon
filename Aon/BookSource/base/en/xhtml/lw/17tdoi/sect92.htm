<h3>92</h3>

<p>Drawing upon your knowledge of Old Kingdom magic, you whisper the words of the spell <i>Invisible Fist</i> and extend your right arm towards the approaching beast. You feel a surge of energy leap from your hand and dart towards its torso, connecting with powerful effect. The ghastly creature shrieks in alarm as it is sent tumbling backwards along the gangplank to crash into a group of skeletal warriors massing on the quayside.</p>
<p>Before the creature can recover, you leap to your feet and deal the gangplank a mighty blow, splitting it cleanly in two. Both sections collapse and splash into the harbour’s freezing water. The creature and its skeletal minions can no longer get aboard the ice-boat but the danger has not diminished. The loathsome creature regains its feet; then it turns its icy rod around and points the blunt end at your head. There is a brilliant flash of light and a guttering ball of flame comes speeding from the base of the rod towards your face. Your reflexes save you—you dive for cover behind a tool chest and the fireball whistles over your head to explode into the decking. Howling with anger, the creature launches a second fireball, but this one is not aimed at you—it is targeted at the ice-boat’s waterline. You feel the deck shudder and see tongues of fire leaping up all around. They spread with unnatural speed and within seconds you are engulfed by roaring flames.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to escape from this burning ice-boat by jumping into the harbour, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to reach the quayside by swinging from the rigging, <a href="sect201.htm">turn to 201</a>.</p>
