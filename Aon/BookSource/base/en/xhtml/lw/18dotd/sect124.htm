<h3>124</h3>

<p>You dare not allow yourself to believe that Guildmaster Banedon and the others are dead. You ask the King to be allowed to travel immediately to the Kai Monastery aboard your flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> so that you may be sure of their fate. King Ulnar considers your request, but he refuses his permission for you to fly to the monastery. He fears that <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> could be destroyed in the same manner that <cite>Skyrider</cite> was felled from the skies. He reasons that if Naar’s minions were capable of wrecking a skyship that was protected by twelve powerful magicians, they would have little difficulty in destroying a skyship with no magical defences whatsoever. And, furthermore, he can ill afford to risk losing you in this fashion. You embody Sommerlund’s only hope of victory against the forces of Naar in this dark hour.</p>
