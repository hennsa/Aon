<h3>149</h3>

<p>Calling upon your Kai Mastery, you cause yourself to slip into a coma-like state which gives every outward appearance of death.</p>
<p>High above, you hear Prince Lutha howling delightedly at the sight of your seemingly lifeless body. He calls for his guards and, a few moments later, you hear them entering the pit. They pronounce you dead; then there follows the tinny sound of metal scraping on metal before you feel yourself being lifted by the shoulders and feet and lowered into a slippery chute. A wave of panic makes you awake from your death-like trance with a start. This sudden and unexpected resurrection makes the guards scream and drop you. They scurry away, gibbering like idiots, and you are left to slide headlong down a chute which leads to a fast-flowing underground river. You hit the cold waters head-first and are carried swiftly away by the strong undercurrent.</p>
