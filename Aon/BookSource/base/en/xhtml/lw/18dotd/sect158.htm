<h3>158</h3>

<p>From the top of the Tower of the Sun you survey the mountainous northern approaches with growing trepidation. Banedon is by your side; so too are Kai Masters Black Hawk and Wild Weasel and a score of Kai warmarns and savants. You sense the lower ranks of the Kai are proud and excited to be stationed here with their Grand Master. Your presence inspires their courage and you feel confident that they will fight exceptionally well in the coming battle.</p>
<p>You look down at the shattered wreck of the <cite>Skyrider</cite> lying in the monastery grounds far below, and it reminds you of your sky journey from Casiorn to Holmgard. You tell Banedon about the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> and you promise him that, if your mission to destroy the Shadow Gate is successful, you will make a gift of it to him in recognition of the help he has given the Kai in your absence.</p>
<p>‘Thank you, Grand Master,’ he says. ‘Yours is a most gracious gesture.’</p>
<p>Then the first of the Lavas horde are seen, their burnished wings glinting in the moonlight.</p>
<p>‘Here they come!’ shouts Black Hawk, from the far end of the tower.</p>
<p>‘Take up your bows, my lords!’ you cry, as the first wave of these winged beasts comes sweeping down from out of the northern sky. ‘And make every arrow count!’</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Bow and wish to use it, <a href="sect178.htm">turn to 178</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="sect4.htm">turn to 4</a>.</p>
