<h3>161</h3>

<p>After bidding a hurried farewell to the Lord Constable and his men, you take a fresh horse and leave the inn by a door at the rear of the stables. Some of the mob have gathered in an adjoining alleyway, but aided by your Kai camouflage skills, you evade these bloodthirsty thugs with ease.</p>
<p>Keeping to the smaller alleys and passages, you make your way across Scade unseen and then head north towards the open plains. You ride all night, using your infravision to help guide your horse through the lush grasslands and keep watch for potential dangers. As the hours slip past you cannot help but think about Nathor and the men of his troop; they are risking their lives by staying behind as bait for the mob. You admire their courage and it strengthens your resolve to return home to Sommerlund. Should the Lord Constable and his men have to pay for your escape with their lives, then you are determined that their sacrifice shall not be a wasted one.</p>
<p>During your long night ride, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
