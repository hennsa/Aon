<h3>193</h3>

<p>You leave this accursed town as quickly as you are able, and skirt around its perimeter before joining the road which heads east towards Abisko. Later in the afternoon, you catch sight of a grand, half-timbered bridge in the far distance. It spans a river, swollen by recent rains, which you recognize at once to be the River Reloni. There is a small circular tent near the approach to the bridge, and three Eldenoran soldiers are seated on stools beside it, each smoking a long-stemmed pipe.</p>
<p>At first you consider avoiding the bridge and finding somewhere else to make a crossing, but the river is wide and fast-flowing, and the three guards look particularly weak and stupid. After some deliberation, you decide to try to bluff your way past them. At your approach, one of the guards gets up off his stool and moves to stand in your way. Casually, he asks to see some sort of identification.</p>
