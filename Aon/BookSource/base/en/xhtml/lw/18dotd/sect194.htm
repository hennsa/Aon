<h3>194</h3>

<p>Before the angry thieves of Spur Lane can catch you, you cross the square and enter Quill Street. This narrow avenue is flanked by aromatic jala houses and perfumeries, until at length it turns abruptly right into a wider thoroughfare called Brass Street. Here you see the courtyard entrance to a grand building whose brick and marble façade is adorned with the words ‘Halls of Learning’. Suddenly you feel inexplicably drawn towards this building; it is as if it possesses the solution to all your problems.</p>
<p>You enter and ride along a gravelled path which leads to a building where a sign, hanging over its richly-carved oak door, simply says ‘Library’. You feel compelled to stop here and, without quite knowing why, you dismount from your horse and tie his reins to a ring which is set into the wall. Then you push open the door and enter the library’s cool interior.</p>
<p>Countless thousands of books and parchments crowd the stone shelves of this magnificent library. Your eyes travel along them until they reach another door at the far end of the hall. There, standing framed in its archway, is an old man clad in plain brown robes. He looks at you and smiles knowingly.</p>
<p>‘Welcome, Grand Master,’ he says. ‘I have been expecting you.’</p>

<p class="choice">If you have never visited any of these places, <a href="sect184.htm">turn to 184</a>.</p>
