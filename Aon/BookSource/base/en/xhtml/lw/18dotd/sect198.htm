<h3>198</h3>

<p>‘In the name of the gods!’ splutters Nathor, spilling liqueur down the front of his tunic. ‘What was that?’</p>
<p>You hurry to the window and see a large, bat-like shape silhouetted against the moon. A man-sized rider clings precariously to the creature’s back as it swoops and soars among the hills and gullies. A knot of fear tightens in the pit of your stomach.</p>
<p>‘A Kraan,’ you say, recognizing at once the outline of this unwelcome creature.</p>
<p>‘You had best come away from the window, my lord,’ replies an anxious Nathor, ‘lest it detect your presence here.’</p>
<p>You take heed of the Lord Constable’s advice and retreat from the window. Furthermore, you use your Magnakai skill of Psi-screen to shield your mind in case the Kraan rider is able to employ psychic abilities to locate your presence.</p>
<p>‘It is not the first time,’ says Rasbarin. ‘Every night for the past ten days we’ve heard it circling the hills. Sometimes there is more than one of its kind.’ He offers you a bunk in the cellar of the monastery where you may be safe from detection, and you accept gladly.</p>
