<h3>20</h3>

<p>The unexpected sound of the voice jolts you to full consciousness. You look around for who it was who uttered these words and, to your surprise, you see an old man dressed in brown robes standing before you, stroking your horse’s nose. Immediately you recognize the kindly face of Gwynian the Sage.</p>
<p>‘Fate calls us together once more, Lone Wolf,’ he says. ‘Come, we have much to discuss.’</p>
<p>And with that he takes hold of your horse’s bridle and leads him across the park to a grand building. It has changed much since you were last here, but despite the new brick and marble façade you recognize Varetta’s Halls of Learning.</p>
<p>You are taken along a gravelled path to a hall, where a sign hanging over its richly-carved oak door says ‘Library’. You dismount, and Gwynian ties the reins to a ring set into the wall. Then he pushes open the door and together you enter the library’s cool interior. Countless thousands of books and parchments crowd the stone shelves of this magnificent library, marching past on either side as you walk towards another door at the far end of the hall.</p>
