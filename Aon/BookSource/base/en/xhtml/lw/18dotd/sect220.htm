<h3>220</h3>

<p>You press on through the trees, your senses alert to the slightest sound. After an hour or so, you stumble across a stream where you stop briefly to gulp a mouthful of icy fresh water. Beyond this stream the trees become far denser, offering you better cover from the wandering groups of Eldenorans who seem to be positioned all over this vast timberland. It is not until later that you realize that they have not been posted here; they are deserters, hiding out in the forest to avoid a certain death at the Reloni Bridge.</p>
<p>By morning, you have covered several miles of forest and avoided all contact with the Eldenorans. Then, shortly before midday, you come across the outlying huts of a fortified town which sits astride a busy woodland trail. A glance at your <a href="map.htm">map</a> reveals this to be Fabri, an Eldenoran outpost close to the Slovian border. From the top of a pine tree you look down on this settlement which is ringed by a palisade. Five cavalry regiments are camped within its perimeter wall of sharpened logs, and you note several Cener Druids conversing with the regimental commanders. It would seem that Prince Lutha is in league with the evil Plague Lords of Ruel.</p>
<p>While you are observing Fabri from your vantage point high above, you notice a patrol of horsemen wending their way through the trees towards one of the outlying huts. On arriving, they dismount and enter, leaving their horses tied to a split rail but otherwise unattended. Tempted by the opportunity, you descend the tree and make your way towards the hut.</p>
