<h3>245</h3>

<p>You have found the body of a Kai Master. His torn and crushed remains are clothed in the grey cloak and tunic that denotes his rank within the New Order. He has been dead for two or three days.</p>
<p>At first you can hardly bear to look at his face, but when you do, you recognize him at once: it is Swift Fire. He was the fastest runner of all the Kai, and you suspect he may have volunteered to use his speed to try to break through the enemy lines. Sadly, it seems, he could not outrun his fate.</p>
<p>Respectfully you cover his face with his cloak and say a short prayer to the God Kai to watch over his spirit. Then you return to the regiment and continue the ride along the trail.</p>
