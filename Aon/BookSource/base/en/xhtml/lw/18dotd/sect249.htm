<h3>249</h3>

<p>Through the foliage you see six well-armed horsemen riding two abreast. They are followed by a carriage, behind which there are another two horsemen guarding the rear. The coach is quite small, suitable for no more than two passengers at most, and its lacquered black wood looks dull. It is covered with the dust of a long journey. It has curtained windows and a crest adorns its doors.</p>
<p>As they draw closer, you see one of the leading horsemen raise his hand to bring the column to a halt. Your heart sinks when you realize that he has seen your horse. Rather than take the risk of losing your mount, you call out to the horseman, commanding him to continue on his way.</p>
<p>‘Show y’self,’ he shouts in reply, and draws his sabre. ‘Unless you be a brigand, you have no need to fear us.’</p>
<p>You remain hidden for a few moments longer, using your Kai skills to determine their purpose. When you can detect no aura of evil about them, you rise from behind the bush so that you can be seen. A pale hand parts the carriage curtains and you glimpse the face of a handsome young woman with jet-black hair. Judging by the finery of her dress and the elegance of her demeanour, you assess her to be of noble birth.</p>
<p>‘You, Sir!’ she calls, with a refined Palmyrion accent. ‘I … I know you. Please, won’t you approach my coach so that I can be sure?’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to do as she requests, <a href="sect201.htm">turn to 201</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to ignore her request and stay where you are, <a href="sect123.htm">turn to 123</a>.</p>
