<h3>256</h3>

<p>You return to the Grand Hall where Banedon and Rimoah tell you of the location of the Shadow Gate.</p>
<p>‘Kai scouts sighted it in the foothills of the Durncrag Mountains, less than five miles distant, at a place called Raven’s Eyrie,’ says Banedon.</p>
<p>‘I know this place,’ you say. ‘My old tutor, Storm Hawk, and I camped there on a hunting trip when I was an acolyte, before the war with Darklord Zagarna. There is a track that leads there—I know it well.’</p>
<p>You are determined to destroy the Shadow Gate and you resolve to go to Raven’s Eyrie tonight, to carry out the mission. Also you are aware that tomorrow is a very special day. It is Fehmarn—the first day of Spring, a holy day in Sommerlund when traditionally all of the Kai gather at the monastery to reaffirm their fealty to King Ulnar and the God Kai. It is also the anniversary of the massacre of the First Order, the day upon which all of your warrior caste, save you, were massacred by Darklord Zagarna’s hordes.</p>
<p>‘I will destroy the Shadow Gate tonight,’ you vow resolutely, ‘and tomorrow we shall celebrate Fehmarn, secure in the knowledge that a lasting peace has returned to our land.’</p>
<p>Moments later, a doleful bell sounds from atop the Durncrag Tower: it is the alarm.</p>
<p>‘Hurry, my lords!’ shouts a young Kai Savant who comes rushing breathlessly into the Grand Hall. ‘The enemy are attacking in force!’</p>
<p>‘To your battle positions, my lords!’ you command, as you stride towards the door. ‘The time has come for you to avenge your dead brothers. Fight well! Fight true! The spirit of the Sun-god Kai is with us this night!’</p>
<p>A great cloud of winged Lavas is speeding towards the monastery from the northwest and they will arrive within a few minutes at most. As you watch the young Kai Lords arm themselves and take up their positions around the monastery, you consider where best to position yourself for the imminent battle.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to join the acolytes who are lining the battlements of the North Watch, <a href="sect114.htm">turn to 114</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to fight from the top of the Tower of the Sun, the highest point in the Kai Monastery, <a href="sect158.htm">turn to 158</a>.</p>
