<h3>271</h3>

<p>‘Very well, Grand Master, if this is the way you choose to proceed with your journey, then you are welcome to ride with me.’</p>
<p>You accept Cearmaine’s offer and, within the hour, you and he are on the road once more, this time riding north on horseback towards the battle that is raging at the Reloni Bridge. When you are three miles from the river you can see the night sky lit up by the fires of war. At two miles, the sounds of singing steel and dying men can be heard on the wind. At a mile distant, you see fields littered with the wounded and dying recently evacuated from the front, and regiments of young Palmyrion reserves nervously awaiting their turn to go forward. And when at last you catch sight of the bridge itself, your stomach churns as you witness the carnage being wrought there.</p>
<p>The bridge and the surrounding banks of the river are carpeted with dead and dying men, twisted into impossible shapes. Massive engines of war bombard the soldiers on both sides, raining fiery death and destruction upon their heads. You have seen many battles in your time, but none to rival the savagery of the conflict that is unfolding here.</p>
<p>Cearmaine catches hold of a young lieutenant whose face is covered with dried blood. Part of his scalp has been sliced away but he seems unaware of his gaping wound. Cearmaine barks a question and the man answers him by pointing to a regiment of pikemen stationed on a distant hill.</p>
<p>‘There stand the Black Ravens—my son’s men. I must away now, Grand Master, so I bid you farewell. The enemy have been repulsed this last hour and are gathering themselves for their next attack. If you are determined to cross the water to their side, you should attempt it now, before they advance again.’ Cearmaine turns his horse about and makes ready to ride off. ‘By the gods, Grand Master, you are brave to have chosen this road home!’ he says, saluting you. ‘I wish you luck—may Kai and Ishir keep you safe. Farewell, my friend. Farewell!’</p>
<p>As the captain gallops away, you look with mounting dread at the slaughter. To cross the river by the bridge is impossible; the only ways across are either upstream to the north, or downstream to the south. To the north you see a dense wall of trees on the far bank, which, judging by the number of arrow-struck bodies lying nearby, you hazard is full of enemy archers. To the south, the far shore is a mass of heavily fortified trenches filled to overflowing with Eldenoran assault troops.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to cross the river north of the bridge, <a href="sect70.htm">turn to 70</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to try a crossing to the south of the bridge, <a href="sect181.htm">turn to 181</a>.</p>
