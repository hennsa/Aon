<h3>290</h3>

<p>Having slain all of the guardsmen, and their sergeant, with stunning ease, the surrounding crowd of Eldenoran pikemen now look at you with fearful respect. You seize the opportunity to wheel your horse about and then you spur him to the gallop and scatter a score of soldiers as you attempt an escape along the crowded west road. Soon the cry goes up from the city’s battlements to stop you and, when you are only a few hundred yards away from the gatehouse, your horse is brought crashing to the ground by a volley of arrows.</p>
<p>A mass of angry Eldenorans close in and grab hold of you before you can get to your feet. Roughly they bind your hands with cord; then they confiscate your Weapons, Belt Pouch, Backpack, and cape (delete these from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>; you need not erase any Special Items, however, as none of these are taken. These Eldenoran soldiers are especially superstitious and fearful of touching magical weapons and artefacts).</p>
<p>Minutes later, the staff-wielding Cener arrives with a horse-drawn cart into which the soldiers bundle you unceremoniously. The robed druid cackles like a crazed maniac, ecstatic at having identified and captured Lone Wolf—the destroyer of so many of his evil brethren. His vile laughter echoes in your ears as he lashes the horses and steers his rickety cart back to the gatehouse and into the dark streets of Duadon beyond. After a short and bruising journey at breakneck speed, you pass beneath the imposing arch of Skull-Tor, the fortified bastion of Duadon’s long line of past rulers, and descend a stone ramp to an underground gaol. Here you are greeted by a squad of brutal guards who beat you mercilessly with staves (lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points) before imprisoning you in a circular pit infested with vermin.</p>
