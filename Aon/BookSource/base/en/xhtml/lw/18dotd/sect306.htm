<h3>306</h3>

<p>Hurriedly you recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Levitation</i> and, as you feel gravity losing its grip, you leap from the floor of the pit in order to boost the effects of the spell.</p>
<p>Prince Lutha sees you come soaring up the shaft towards him and he is frozen with shock. Your swift action prevents him from activating the evil power of the ring he wears, a power which could spell your doom, but you sense that it is only a matter of seconds before he comes to his senses.</p>
<p>You rise up through the opening and strike a blow with your fist which glances off the side of Lutha’s face. He reels backwards, but the sudden pain serves to awaken him from his shock, and when he comes back at you he has a needle-sharp dagger clasped in his hand.</p>
<p class="combat">Prince Lutha (with Ring of Power): <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 54   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 39</p>
<p>While wearing the Ring of Power, Lutha is immune to all forms of psychic attack, except Kai-surge and Kai-blast.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect89.htm">turn to 89</a>.</p>
