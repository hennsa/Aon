<h3>317</h3>

<p>At first you are tempted to use your psychic Kai skills to influence this guard, to persuade him to lose interest in you and return to his pipe-smoking comrades seated outside the tent. But then you sense that they are not the only ones standing guard over this bridge. Beyond a nearby knoll you feel the presence of many horses and men: it is an Eldenoran cavalry encampment.</p>
<p>When you delay in showing the sallow-faced guard the identification that he wants to see, he becomes abusive and threatens to throw you in the river. To quieten his anger, you offer him a bribe. It is an offer which gains his undivided attention. He says that for 20 Gold Crowns he will let you across the bridge. If you do not possess sufficient money, this greedy guard will settle for half of the items in your Backpack plus one Special Item of your choice. Not wishing to have an entire Eldenoran cavalry regiment descend on you, you reluctantly agree to his extortionate terms.</p>
<p class="choice">Make the necessary adjustments to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> before <a href="sect209.htm">turning to 209</a>.</p>
