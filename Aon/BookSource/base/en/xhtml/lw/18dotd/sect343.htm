<h3>343</h3>

<p>It is near midnight when you arrive at a ridge which commands a view of the mighty River Storn. Moonlight pours molten silver over the rushing water, illuminating a ford where a crossing can be made over this unusually deep and fast-flowing river. To the far horizon stretch the plains of Slovia, peaceful and inviting. You long to be on the other side, but you suspect that crossing here, despite the ford, will not be an easy task. Heavily fortified border posts stand at the approaches to the ford, and many keen-eyed sentries are scanning the surrounding countryside on both sides of the river. The Eldenorans are watching for deserters attempting to flee to the safety of Slovia, a neutral territory in the war against Palmyrion; the Slovians keep watch for signs of an Eldenoran attack. It would not be the first time an invasion by their hostile neighbour had come this way.</p>
<p>Patiently you observe the ford for more than an hour, trying to determine the optimum time to make your move, but then suddenly the choice is taken out of your hands. In the middle distance you see an Eldenoran patrol riding towards the ridge. Unless you abandon the ridge at once, they will be sure to see you and raise an alarm.</p>
<p>Taking your courage in both hands, you spur your horse to the gallop and rush headlong down the rocky slope that leads directly to the ford.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Assimilance, add 3 to the number you have picked. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 2. And if you possess Kai-alchemy, add 1.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 2 or less, <a href="sect218.htm">turn to 218</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 3–6, <a href="sect87.htm">turn to 87</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 7 or more, <a href="sect119.htm">turn to 119</a>.</p>
