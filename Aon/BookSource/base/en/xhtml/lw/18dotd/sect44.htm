<h3>44</h3>

<p>King Ulnar convenes an emergency council of the Sommlending barons in his Chamber of State. When all are assembled, Baron Caldar of Anskaven conducts a briefing, principally for your benefit, outlining the grave situation confronting Sommerlund and, most especially, the New Order of the Kai. You are aware of much of what he says, having been briefed already by Gwynian the Sage in Varetta, but you learn that the Sommlending army has lost many brave men attempting to break the siege at the Kai Monastery and is too weakened, at present, to attack the enemy again.</p>
<p>‘Where is Guildmaster Banedon?’ you ask, when called upon by the King to speak to the council of war.</p>
<p>‘He is at the Kai Monastery,’ answers Baron Medar of Tyso. ‘He, in company with Lord Rimoah of Dessi and the ten most senior magicians of Toran’s Brotherhood, went to the monastery during the early days of the siege. They travelled there aboard the Guildmaster’s skyship and … ’ At this point, the Baron hesitates and looks to the King, as if seeking his permission to continue. The King continues on his behalf.</p>
<p>‘Grand Master,’ he says, his voice heavy, ‘the Guildmaster’s skyship was seen falling from the skies above the monastery. Border Rangers saw it crash in flames. We … we fear that all aboard were lost.’</p>
<p>The King’s words come as a terrible blow for Banedon and Rimoah are your closest friends. If it is true, and all of Sommerlund’s finest magicians have been lost at a stroke, then the blow is doubly severe. The security of your homeland will have been greatly compromised by their deaths.</p>
