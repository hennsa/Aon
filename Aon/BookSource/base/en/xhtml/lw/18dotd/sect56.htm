<h3>56</h3>

<p>You sleep well and rise with the cock’s crow. When you reach the stable, you discover the innkeeper has already prepared your horse, ready for your departure. You thank him and wave farewell to the cheerful man and his daughter as you set off on the road north to Varetta.</p>
<p>It is midday when you catch your first glimpse of this ancient city. Positioned on a large plateau in the centre of a grassy plain, the blood-red walls and towering spires of Varetta look doubly impressive. As you approach the south gate, you admire the carvings which embellish the city’s walls. They depict great dragons with snake-like bodies that intertwine as they flow around the towers and bastions of this ancient city.</p>
<p>The guards at the gate allow you to enter without challenge, and you pass through the grand southern entrance which leads to a flagstoned square.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have ever visited Varetta before in a previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure, <a href="sect284.htm">turn to 284</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have never visited this city before, <a href="sect62.htm">turn to 62</a>.</p>
