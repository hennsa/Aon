<h3>82</h3>

<p>Using the Old Kingdom Battle-spell <i>Hold Enemy</i>, you command the Eldenoran to cease all movement. Instantly, the drunken thug freezes like a stone statue, enabling the young woman and her child to break free from his grasp. She runs towards you, cradling the sobbing child in her arms.</p>
<p>‘Thank you, thank you … ’ she cries as she falls to your feet. Gently you lift her, assuring her with kind words that her ordeal is over. She smiles, reassured, but her expression quickly changes when she spots something moving behind you.</p>
<p>‘There he is, that cur Holkar!’ she spits. ‘He’s the murdering leader of these bandits. All this chaos is his doing.’</p>
<p>You turn to look at the object of her hatred, and see a swarthy brigand dodging between the gravestones that line the abbey grounds. He has a sack full of loot slung over his shoulder and he is hurrying towards his horse which stands close to the abbey’s perimeter wall. Determined not to let him escape, you rush into the grounds of the abbey and give chase.</p>
