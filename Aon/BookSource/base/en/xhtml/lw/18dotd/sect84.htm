<h3>84</h3>

<p>‘Grand Master, let me introduce you to Captain Cearmaine,’ says Elector Manatine, formally presenting the tough-looking officer to you. ‘I have chosen him to see you safely to Holona. He will do all he can to help you through the battle zone so that you may press on with your urgent journey to Casiorn.’</p>
<p>You recognize the captain’s name and recall having heard tales of his bravery during the Darklands War. His acts of heroism turned many battles to the favour of the Freeland Armies and earned him a respected reputation throughout Northern Magnamund. You could not have asked for a better man to escort you on the next, difficult stage of your vital journey.</p>
<p>He offers you his hand in friendship and you are mildly shocked when your fingers close around a palm crafted from cold steel.</p>
<p>‘A keepsake from the Battle of Vellino,’ he says, smiling at his metal hand. ‘Sadly, the first was stole away by a Drakkar’s axe.’</p>
