<h3>92</h3>

<p>After the dangers of Eldenora, the plains of peaceful Slovia seem like a tranquil paradise. The grasslands are rich and fertile, and an abundance of game keeps you well fed during the five days it takes you to ride north to the walled city of Tekaro. Here, at an inn close by the city’s cathedral, where, years ago, you discovered one of the Lorestones of Nyxator during your quest for Kai knowledge, you spend a fortunate evening in the company of a band of Salonese mercenaries. Aided by your Kai skills, you fleece them of 30 Gold Crowns while playing cards, and with your gain you purchase a fresh horse for your continuing journey home. (Your new horse and a night’s lodging at the inn cost you 25 Gold Crowns; you may add the balance of 5 Gold Crowns to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, maximum allowances permitting.)</p>
<p>Early the following day you leave Tekaro and set out on the highway bound for Tido. You plan to reach Casiorn by means of the North Pass through the Slovarian Range, but during your second day on the road you are forced to revise your plans drastically. During a chance meeting at a wayside inn with a merchant who has journeyed from Casiorn, you learn that an avalanche has blocked the North Pass and travel by that route is now impossible. It will be several months before the pass is cleared and the mountain road rebuilt. You resolve instead to reach Casiorn by way of Varetta, the ancient city of crossed swords, and the following day you resume your ride north.</p>
<p>During your ride, you stop to assist a farmer whose cart has shed a wheel. In return for your help, he offers the services of his brother who operates a raft ferry across the River Quarl. Gladly the brother transports you and your horse across the river to Salony, where you enter the Great Forest by way of a timberland trail. After a full day’s ride along this lonely track, you find yourself approaching the outskirts of a town called Ellio.</p>
<p>During your long day’s ride through the Forest of Salony, unless you possess Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
