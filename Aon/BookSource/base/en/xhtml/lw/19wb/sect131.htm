<h3>131</h3>

<p>The inside of the tomb is a cold and sombre place, devoid of all life. Its featureless walls glisten with rivulets of moisture and the air is dank and evil smelling, like the breath of some cold-blooded reptile. At its centre, where one would have expected to find the remains of the nobleman who long ago was incarcerated here, there is instead a yawning shaft. An ancient bronze ladder is fixed to the shaft wall which descends to an unknown depth.</p>
<p>Using your Kai senses, you scan the tomb and detect lingering traces of the impostor. His trail leads directly to the ladder. After satisfying yourself that your quarry has left behind no unwelcome surprises, you step onto the ladder and begin a slow descent into the shaft.</p>
<p>The ladder ends inside a larger stone chamber, one hundred feet below the tomb. Here you discover a granite coffin embellished with runes and ancient Sommlending script. As you wait for your Kai companions to complete their descent, you read enough of the script to learn that you have found the final resting place of Hul Garrulen, the third Baron of Tyso. Your senses confirm that you are on the trail of the impostor, yet there appear to be no other exits from this chamber, other than the shaft by which you entered.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and have attained the rank of Kai Grand Crown, <a href="sect290.htm">turn to 290</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to attain this level of Kai Grand Mastery, <a href="sect125.htm">turn to 125</a>.</p>
