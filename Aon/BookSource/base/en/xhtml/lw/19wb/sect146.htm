<h3>146</h3>

<p>You step out from beneath the leaf under which you have been hiding and focus on the distant vent. Carefully you recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Levitation</i> that Guildmaster Banedon taught you many years ago, and moments later you feel yourself floating upwards through the air towards the apex of this gigantic cavern.</p>
<p>The spell frees you from the grip of gravity and enables you to soar towards the cavern’s roof. However, you are unable to control the angle of your ascent and in order to steer yourself towards the vent, you must try to position yourself in one of the thermal currents which are rising from the canyon floor.</p>
<p>After some great effort you manage to locate a benign thermal which carries you slowly towards the distant vent. Unfortunately, you are not the only creature enjoying the hospitality of this rising current. You have soared close to a mile above the canyon when suddenly you attract the unwanted attention of a gigantic dragonfly. Anxious to defend yourself in case it should attack, you draw a weapon and wait with bated breath as it circles around your floating form.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Assimilance, add 1 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 6 or less, <a href="sect75.htm">turn to 75</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 7 or higher, <a href="sect244.htm">turn to 244</a>.</p>
