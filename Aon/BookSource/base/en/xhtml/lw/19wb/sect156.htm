<h3>156</h3>

<p>With bated breath you watch as the warrior kicks the smouldering remains of the iron chest. He scans the warehouse, the visor of his helmet pulsing a dull crimson glow as he tries to locate where you are hiding. Unable to find you, he cradles his weapon and begins a systematic search of the building.</p>
<p>As he passes beneath the storage tank you seize the opportunity to launch a surprise attack. You leap onto his back and bring him crashing to the ground. However, you soon discover that he is an exceptionally strong opponent and your advantage of surprise is quickly lost. He draws his power from the armour he wears, and you are hard-pressed to maintain your hold on his neck as he wrestles to break free. Then another warrior appears at the rear of the building. He, too, is armed with a magical spear. He aims this weapon at you and a flash of light erupts from its tip.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score is 12 or less, deduct 2 from the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 0 or less, <a href="sect93.htm">turn to 93</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 1 or more, <a href="sect63.htm">turn to 63</a>.</p>
