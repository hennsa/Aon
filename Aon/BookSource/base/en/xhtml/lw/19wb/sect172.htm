<h3>172</h3>

<p>You muster your skill and plunge your hand into the water, close to where the creature’s head has surfaced. In an instant, the black water around its neck and body freezes over, trapping and crushing the beast within a solid block of ice.</p>
<p>Free now to continue your pursuit, you leave the frozen cellar-beast and climb the steps to emerge amongst the ruins of the city. There is no sign of Wolf’s Bane, but when you hurry to where you saw him last, you discover a flight of steps leading down into a wide underground passage. His tracks can be seen clearly embedded in the muddy floor of this tunnel.</p>
<p>The tunnel passes under a broad avenue and then surfaces in front of a grand two-storey building. This was once a busy warehouse that stored braided coils of fine copper cable. You avoid the main entrance in case your adversary is lying in ambush there, and enter instead by way of a flight of iron steps that leads to a second floor window. The moment you set foot inside the building you sense that Wolf’s Bane is here. Warily you explore, your nerves stretched to breaking point as your eyes seek out detail in the darkness. You are approaching the west wing of this building when you suddenly catch sight of your opponent through a hole in the floor. He is sitting on his haunches behind a mound of wooden crates, busily eating a green-skinned fruit, and he is unaware that you are watching him.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Magi-magic and have attained the rank of Grand Thane (and wish to use your skill), <a href="sect81.htm">turn to 81</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Bow and wish to use it, <a href="sect106.htm">turn to 106</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use it, <a href="sect319.htm">turn to 319</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess none of these skills, or have yet to reach the required level of Kai rank, or simply choose not to use them, <a href="sect20.htm">turn instead to 20</a>.</p>
