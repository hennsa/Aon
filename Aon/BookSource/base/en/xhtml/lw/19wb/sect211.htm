<h3>211</h3>

<p>The moment the rock passes over the glyph there is a blinding flash of white light, followed almost instantly by the deafening crackle of exploding electrical energies. Splinters of stone ricochet from the gravestone behind which you and your fellow Kai have wisely taken cover, and the stench of scorched earth and ozone assails your nostrils.</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, the noise and light cease and the burial ground is shrouded once more in gloomy silence. You peer over the gravestone to see that the doorway is now clear of rubble, save for the slab upon which the glyph is inscribed. The destructive power of the glyph has been discharged, but only temporarily. Your senses warn you that it is recharging; you have but a few seconds in which to enter the tomb before the magical device is active once more.</p>
<p>‘Quickly, my lords,’ you say, as you spring to your feet and hurry towards the entrance. ‘Follow me!’</p>
