<h3>220</h3>

<p>You can feel a warm breeze wafting along this new hallway and you sense that it comes from a stairwell at its far end. When you investigate it, you rediscover Wolf’s Bane’s footprints on the stone steps. You cast your hands over them and detect that this is not a false trail: your enemy passed this way sometime within the last hour.</p>
<p>Slowly you ascend the stairs and arrive at the arched entrance to a large, vaulted stone chamber. Gathered around a fountain set into its north wall are a group of six grey-skinned humanoids. They are busy drinking a clear, oily fluid that pours from the fountain’s spout into a semicircular trough. All are barefoot and clad in rags, and they are each armed with a spear and a bow. The only exit from this chamber appears to be an archway set high in the north wall. There is a balcony in front of it that can only be reached by two flights of stairs which rise up on either side of the fountain.</p>
<p>Quietly you observe the creatures slaking their thirsts, and you try to formulate a way in which you can get past them and reach the balconied exit in the north wall.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Bow and the Discipline of Magi-magic and have attained the rank of Kai Grand Guardian, <a href="sect138.htm">turn to 138</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and have attained the rank of Grand Crown (and wish to use it), <a href="sect26.htm">turn to 26</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess these skills, or a Bow, or if you have yet to attain the required levels of Kai Mastery, or if you choose not to use either of them, <a href="sect121.htm">turn to 121</a>.</p>
