<h3>246</h3>

<p>You use your advanced mastery to find your enemy’s tracks, and then you clear a path through the dense undergrowth which covers them. You sense that he has used magic to assist his escape, for the foliage here is entangled far tighter than in neighbouring areas of this jungle. Your advanced Discipline flattens the undergrowth as you advance, as if you were being preceded by some invisible battering ram. So effective is your skill that you gain ground on your fleeing enemy.</p>
<p>As you pass through a copse of toa trees, you hear the sound of running water away to your left. The tracks turn in this direction and you follow them all the way to the banks of a fast-flowing watercourse. Less than fifty yards downstream there is a primitive settlement of huts that form an untidy line along the banks of the stream. You catch sight of Wolf’s Bane as he runs into this settlement and hides in the nearest hut—a mud-walled hovel with a clay-tile roof.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stay in the jungle and observe the settlement, <a href="sect339.htm">turn to 339</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to continue your pursuit, you can approach the settlement under cover of the jungle, by <a href="sect285.htm">turning to 285</a>.</p>
