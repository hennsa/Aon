<h3>296</h3>

<p>The triumphant sneer dies on Wolf’s Bane’s face the instant he realizes that his winged minion has disappeared and that you are still alive. He recoils, his mouth gaping and his eyes wide with disbelief. As he retreats, he brushes against Alyss and utters a yelp of fright. His abject fear, however, soon transforms into blind fury.</p>
<p>‘You!’ he cries, accusingly. Fuelled by rage, he raises his sword in readiness to slash at her face. You rush forward and block his vicious blow; then you twist the blade from his grasp and, with one swift thrust, you skewer his heart upon the tip of your rapier.</p>
<p>Wolf’s Bane regards the blade protruding from his chest with a look of utter astonishment. Then, with a curse on his blood-flecked lips, he drops to his knees and crumples lifelessly to the floor.</p>
