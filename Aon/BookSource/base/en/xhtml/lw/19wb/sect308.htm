<h3>308</h3>

<p>For two hours you observe the tower. During this time you sense that an invisible field of energy surrounds the wall, a defence that complements the terrifyingly deep moat. This force field disappears only when the portal opens and the drawbridge extends to allow for the arrival or departure of armoured warriors, or strange horseless wagons that hover a few feet from the ground, but in the main the great door remains firmly closed.</p>
<p>You notice that the sparse traffic of warriors and wagons passes along one avenue. It is the only thoroughfare approaching the tower which has been cleared of debris. It is an uncomfortable vigil, but the time you spend observing the tower is rewarded when a bold plan gradually takes form in your mind.</p>
<p>You assess that an entry to the tower could be effected by two means: if you were able to ambush a warrior and use his armour as a disguise, or, if you were able to stow away aboard one of the wagons approaching the moat.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to ambush one of the armoured warriors, <a href="sect276.htm">turn to 276</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to attempt to stow away aboard a hover-wagon, <a href="sect79.htm">turn to 79</a>.</p>
