<h3>344</h3>

<p>You race along the passageway and turn the corner to see a tunnel sloping away into the gloom. The walls and ceiling are dripping wet, indicating to you that this dingy passageway passes directly under the stream. You hurry along its narrow confines, your shoulders grazing its muddy walls as you run, until you arrive at a flight of steps that ascend to an archway supported by thick wooden beams. Beyond the arch lies a large subterranean chamber that is daubed and decorated with runes and evil insignia. It is a primitive temple, and it radiates an aura of Evil so malicious that it makes your skin crawl.</p>

<p>On the far side of this unholy place, you see a stone altar standing before a huge boulder that has been crudely chiselled to resemble a grinning human skull. An eerie green glow pulsates from the eye sockets of this great skull-rock, and a mist swirls from its open jaw. Wolf’s Bane is at the centre of the chamber but he is moving quickly towards the altar. You command him to stop and face you, but he ignores your order and continues running until he reaches the jaw of the great stone skull, which is flanked by two staves of iron set into holes in the ground. Gasping for breath, he now turns to face you. For a moment his evil eyes dart towards one of the iron staves and he reaches out a hand as if to grasp it. But, seemingly, he changes his mind. He sees you entering the temple and he turns and runs into the open jaw of the skull to be swallowed up by the roiling mist.</p>
<p>Quickly you pursue him, confident that you can maintain the upper hand so long as you do not lose his trail.</p>
