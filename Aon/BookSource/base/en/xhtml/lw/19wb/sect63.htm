<h3>63</h3>

<p>You release your grip of your enemy and roll away from him. Moments later, the beam from his comrade’s weapon hits his side and erupts through the back of his armour. The force of the impact lifts him bodily from the floor and hurls him into a pile of rusty cylinders, bringing them crashing down to bury him. Shocked and angry at having accidentally killed his confederate, the newly-arrived warrior rushes forward. He is determined to find and finish you once and for all, but his anger and his armour put him at a disadvantage. He fails to see where you have gone and, under cover of the smoke and debris, you manage to circle around behind him without being seen.</p>
