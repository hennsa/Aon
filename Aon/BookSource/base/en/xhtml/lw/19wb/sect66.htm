<h3>66</h3>

<p>You ask Steel Hand to give you his rope, and he obeys dutifully. Then you utter the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Levitation</i>, and almost immediately you feel gravity losing its grip on your body. Gently you rise to the ceiling of the vault where, using the exposed stone buttresses, you are able to pull yourself along until you are directly above the centre of the fissure. Here you fix one end of the rope to an exposed stone beam and cast the other end to your companions waiting below. One by one they swing across the void and, when all have crossed safely, you untie the rope and pull yourself to the far side before intoning the words that cancel the effects of the spell.</p>
<p>It is clear from their wide-eyed expressions that they are all impressed with your mastery of Brotherhood magic, especially Steel Hand. You gather up his rope, and as you give it back to him you say: ‘Don’t worry. One day I’ll instruct you in the ways of magic so that you, too, can walk a ceiling!’</p>
<p>The young Kai Master smiles as he stuffs his rope into his bulging backpack.</p>
<p>‘And now, my lords, we must press on. We’ve a trail to find,’ you say, and you motion your companions to follow as you get ready to leave this chamber.</p>
