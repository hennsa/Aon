<h3>79</h3>

<p>You make your way towards the avenue and take cover in a darkened alleyway, an ideal place from which to observe the passing traffic. Thirty minutes elapse before a hover-wagon glides into view at the city end of the avenue. It is bound for the tower, but you note that its cargo compartment is completely sealed and so you decide to let it pass and wait for a more suitable target. Fortunately, you do not have to wait too long. Within the space of a few minutes another appears. This one, like the first, has no driver, but its cargo bay is open to the elements. As you wait for it to get closer, you judge its speed and prepare yourself to leap aboard as it passes. It is less heavily laden than the first wagon and is moving much quicker; leaping aboard this speeding wagon is not going to be easy.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Pathsmanship, add 3 to the number you have picked. If your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score is 12 or less, deduct 2 from the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total is now 2 or less, <a href="sect301.htm">turn to 301</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 3 or higher, <a href="sect185.htm">turn to 185</a>.</p>
