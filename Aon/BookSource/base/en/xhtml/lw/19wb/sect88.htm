<h3>88</h3>

<p>Caldar removes his hand from his sword and heaves a sigh of relief. ‘Thank Ishir you’ve returned to us, Grand Master. Perhaps now the evil that has befallen Sommerlund will be avenged.’</p>
<p>The Baron summons his gaoler who unlocks the shackles that encase your wrists. Then, as the three of you hurriedly ascend from the castle dungeons to the Great Hall, Caldar and Banedon confirm the account of events that you extracted earlier from the gaoler. In addition to these facts you also learn that several days ago an angry mob, composed in the main of soldiers and citizens from Holmgard, marched upon the Kai Monastery. Firestone, the most senior of the New Order Kai, pleaded with the mob for calm. Fortunately they heeded his call and allowed him to send four Kai Masters to Tyso—the city where the impostor was last sighted. Firestone has ordered these four Kai to track down and slay the impostor as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You are in no doubt that this impostor is a formidable enemy, one who could easily prove more than a match for the four young Kai. Anxious for their safety, you request that you be allowed to ride to Tyso to join with them. Banedon is in agreement, but he suggests a swifter and surer way that you may reach Tyso. Moored to the tower of Baron Caldar’s castle is <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>—the Guildmaster’s skyship—which he places at your disposal. Gratefully you accept his generous offer.</p>
<p>You are keen to leave for Tyso without further delay, but before you depart, Baron Caldar offers you the chance to equip yourself with weapons and stores from his well-stocked armoury.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accept the Baron’s offer, <a href="sect149.htm">turn to 149</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to decline his offer, <a href="sect260.htm">turn to 260</a>.</p>
