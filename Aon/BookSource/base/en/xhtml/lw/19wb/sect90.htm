<h3>90</h3>

<p>You force your way through the dense tangle of plants and grasses and soon reach the place where Wolf’s Bane lay in wait for you. The foliage around this hiding place has been carefully arranged, which suggests to you that he must have spent some considerable time setting his ambush. Yet there is also evidence of a hasty retreat. Lying on the ground behind a tree you discover 2 Arrows and a Dagger. (If you wish to take one or more of these, remember to make the appropriate adjustments to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>Determined to stay on his trail while it is still fresh, you leave this hide and press deeper into the jungle in pursuit of your enemy. However, you have penetrated less than twenty yards into the undergrowth when his trail becomes indistinct.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Discipline of Grand Pathsmanship and have attained the rank of Kai Grand Crown, <a href="sect246.htm">turn to 246</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to attain this level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect77.htm">turn to 77</a>.</p>
