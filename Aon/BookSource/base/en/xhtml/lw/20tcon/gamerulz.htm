<h2>The Game Rules</h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>For more than ten years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess—<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>—and physical stamina—<span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Before you begin this ultimate Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of 31). When you fight, your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1–19), you can carry your current scores of <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points over to Book 20. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1–5) or <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6–12) adventures.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-1-foot" name="gamerulz-1">1</a></sup> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series.<sup><a href="#gamerulz-2-foot" name="gamerulz-2">2</a></sup> You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1–5) and <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6–12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13–onwards):</p>
<ul>
<li>Crystal Star Pendant</li>
<li>Sommerswerd<sup><a href="#gamerulz-3-foot" name="gamerulz-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Silver Helm</li>
<li>Dagger of Vashna</li>
<li>Silver Bracers</li>
<li>Jewelled Mace</li>
<li>Silver Bow of Duadon</li>
<li>Helshezag</li>
<li>Korlinium Scabbard</li>
<li>Kagonite Chainmail</li>

<p>[<a name="gamerulz-1-foot" href="#gamerulz-1">1</a>] The Discipline bonuses mentioned do not affect your permanent scores. If you have completed previous adventures, the Disciplines that you have mastered may still be beneficial. See the Grand Master Rules section of the <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/ReadersHandbook/Home">Readers’ Handbook</a> for details.</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-2-foot" href="#gamerulz-2">2</a>] If you have completed any previous <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> adventures, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add +1 to your basic <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and +2 to your basic <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> for each adventure you successfully completed (cf. <a href="discplnz.htm">Grand Master Disciplines</a>).</p><p>[<a name="gamerulz-3-foot" href="#gamerulz-3">3</a>] If you possess the Sommerswerd, <a href="../../lw/18dotd/sect98.htm">Section 98</a> of <a href="../../lw/18dotd/title.htm"><cite>Dawn of the Dragons</cite></a> suggests that you may be able to add 4 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> when using it in the Plane of Darkness (in addition to all other combat bonuses for this Special Item).</p></div>
