<h3>105</h3>

<p>You shout the word ‘Khula’ and the effect is both immediate and electrifying. Nza’pok freezes, as if he has suddenly turned to stone, and a sheen of grey ice appears on his foul-smelling blubbery skin. Then the iron amulet which is hanging by a chain from his lower lip begins to pulsate with an eerie green light. The chaos-horde are at first stunned by their leader’s transformation; then shock rapidly becomes a blind panic and they turn and flee, dropping their spears and trampling each other in their scramble to get away.</p>
<p>Swiftly you climb the wall of the pit, and as you pull yourself over the edge, you see the mass of humanoids and ant-creatures swarming across a bridge which leads to a neighbouring delta island. Once the last few are across, a rope is pulled and the middle section of the bridge drops away into the river to prevent you from pursuing them. Confident that the horde no longer poses any threat, you return your gaze to its frozen leader. Nza’pok is completely immobile except for his eyes which blaze with a potent mix of fear and hatred. You sense that this once all-powerful being is terrified that you will now enact your revenge upon his helpless body.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to unsheathe a weapon and slay Nza’pok while he is unable to resist, <a href="sect13.htm">turn to 13</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide not to kill him, but wish to take the glowing amulet which hangs from his mouth, <a href="sect139.htm">turn to 139</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to ignore Nza’pok and the amulet, you can escape from the settlement by <a href="sect126.htm">turning to 126</a>.</p>
