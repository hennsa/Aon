<h3>151</h3>

<p>Relying on the element of surprise, you leap through the entrance and rush towards a gap in the line of advancing horrors. They immediately try to close ranks but their reactions are deathly slow and you are easily able to barge your way through them. Unfortunately you do not get very far; a heavy weight hits you squarely in the back and knocks you to your knees. As you struggle to stand in the thick mud you are engulfed by a coarse rope net dropped from above. Frantically you scrabble to untangle yourself, but a second net smothers the first and delays you long enough for the ghoulish horde to close in and pin you down. Two of the winged flyers descend close by and hurriedly they thread ropes through the edges of the nets. When their task is completed they shriek loudly and suddenly you feel yourself being hoisted aloft.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If the number you have picked is 0–4, you lose 1 Backpack Item of your choice as you are lifted into the air. If the number you have picked is 5–9, your money pouch spills open and you lose all of your Gold Crowns.</p>
<p class="choice">After making the necessary adjustments to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, you may continue by <a href="sect63.htm">turning to 63</a>.</p>
