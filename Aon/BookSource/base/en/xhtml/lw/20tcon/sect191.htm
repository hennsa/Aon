<h3>191</h3>

<p>The insects fall under the spell of your mental command and enter the core of their hive to sleep. When all their number have entered and you are sure that it is safe to approach, you squeeze yourself through a gap in the stones and take shelter here from the rain.</p>
<p>As you wait for the rain to abate, you inspect the inside of the hollow and the pendulous insect hive. Despite the seemingly haphazard lie of the stone slabs, the rain does not penetrate into the interior, and the inside of the hollow stays remarkably dry. On the ground lies a thick carpet of soft leathery leaves. They are spattered with a yellow, honey-like substance which is oozing from the base of the hive. It smells sweet but your Kai senses warn you not to taste any: it is poisonous. (If you wish to take some of this, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as Muntaag Honey. You can wrap it in a leaf and store it as a Backpack Item.)</p>
<p>You are busy cleaning the acidic rain from your equipment with a handful of leaves when suddenly your Sixth Sense warns you of approaching danger. You peer out through a crack in the stones and catch sight of a flock of bat-winged creatures. They are swooping down from out of the rainy sky towards your hiding place.</p>
