<h3>216</h3>

<p>You work the turgid water with your paddle and enter the sluggish tidal flow of the estuary. Warily you scan the jungle which fringes both banks of this wide river mouth, your eyes peeled for signs of danger. You sense the presence of hostile creatures yet, even with your advanced Kai skills, you can detect no evidence that this territory is inhabited. You have progressed more than a mile up river when you notice the jungle on the left bank is receding, leaving an expanse of marshy ground dotted with shrubs and sparse vegetation. You bring the canoe towards this bank where it grounds in the shallows less than twenty feet from the muddy shore. Not wishing to get any muddier than is necessary, you leap from the canoe towards the grassy bank but land a few feet short. To your dismay, you immediately sink up to your knees in the soft, sludgy mire.</p>
<p>Suddenly you hear the sound of churning water. You glance behind and are horrified to see three large spider-like monstrosities rising up out of the murky water at the rear of the canoe. These creatures are the size of large dogs and their bulbous bodies are covered with short stubbly hairs. With unnerving stealth they creep across the mud and attack with their barbed forelegs and needle-sharp teeth.</p>
