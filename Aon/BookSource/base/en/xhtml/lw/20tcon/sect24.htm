<h3>24</h3>

<p>You are about to push your way through this barrier of vines when you notice something strange: each creeper is trembling very slightly, as if it is shivering with cold or fear. You draw your weapon and use it to prise the vines apart, but suddenly you hear something which makes you freeze. From somewhere above the canopy of branches there comes a deafening noise, like the sound of heavy tropical rainfall. As if in response to this noise the hanging vines rise up and flail the air. They lash out at you with stunning ferocity, forcing you to retreat along the trail before their stinging blows: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. With mounting dread you realize that these vines are not plants at all: they are hostile living creatures.</p>
<p>Beneath the coating of moss which sheathes the vines are hundreds of tiny hollow barbs, capable of ripping flesh to shreds. You strike out at them, smashing one in half. It emits a high-pitched squeal as it recoils, trailing a spray of sticky green slime from its broken tip. As if enraged by their companion’s cry of pain, the remaining vines snake towards you with increased tenacity. You must fight them.</p>
<p class="combat">Haemodyls: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 49   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 45</p>
<p>These vine-creatures are immune to all forms of psychic attack, except Kai-blast and Kai-ray. If you possess Animal Mastery, you may add 2 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of this fight.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect19.htm">turn to 19</a>.</p>
