<h3>249</h3>

<p>The swirling spirit of Cadak condenses and shapes itself into a column of flickering light. It now resembles a large candle flame, but one that radiates an icy coldness. Within this chill flame you see Cadak’s evil eyes glowing hypnotically. You draw on your psychic defences to shield yourself from an imminent attack, and moments later, you feel pulses of energy bombarding the wall that you have erected around your mind. You sense that your speedy and successful defence has greatly weakened your old enemy. You are about to turn the tables by launching a counterattack when suddenly you hear something quite unexpected.</p>
<p>‘Spare me and forgive me, Lone Wolf,’ pleads Cadak’s plaintive voice in your mind. ‘I renounce my evil past. Forgive me so that death may free my soul from the slavery of Evil. Grant me this salvation and I shall help you to escape from the realm of the Künae.’</p>
<p>The host of maggots which carpet the floor of this foul hall suddenly recede like an ebb-tide. As they retreat, a glowing ring is revealed lying on the slime-smeared ground.</p>
<p>‘Take the ring, Lone Wolf. Take the ring and grant me your forgiveness. With the ring the way is clear for you to leave this hall through the Tunnel of the Wyrm.’</p>
<p>Beyond the flame-like spirit of Cadak you can see the rotting rib cage of the carcass. The semicircular shadow that occupies it is now pulsing with a warm, amber light.</p>
<p class="choice">If you agree to forgive the spirit of Cadak and wish to pick up the ring, <a href="sect128.htm">turn to 128</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you refuse to forgive the spirit of Cadak and decide that you will not pick up the ring, <a href="sect20.htm">turn to 20</a>.</p>
