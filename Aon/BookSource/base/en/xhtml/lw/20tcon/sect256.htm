<h3>256</h3>

<p>Hurriedly you retrieve the Potion from your pack for you recall that Shamath had intended to use this preparation to enact her revenge upon Avarvae. With the memory of the Demoness’s words lingering prophetically in your ears, you pull out the stopper which seals the glass phial and hurl the golden fluid into the sneering face of the Tormentress.</p>
<p>Avarvae’s scream echoes to the furthest corners of her vast domain. With her hands clutched to her face, the wounded Tormentress soars like a meteor into the darkness above and disappears completely, leaving her carriage and her escort of outriders dazed and confused in her wake. The sound of Avarvae’s terrible scream followed by her sudden rout shatters their nerve. Quickly they wheel their steeds about and, with Avarvae’s chariot in tow, they flee across the cosmic starscape in search of their immortal mistress.</p>
<p>The way is now clear for you to reach the Bridge of the Damned. Using your innate Magnakai Discipline of Divination, you will yourself towards the bridge and feel your body moving rapidly through the void towards its rainbow span. (Remember to delete Shamath’s Potion from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
