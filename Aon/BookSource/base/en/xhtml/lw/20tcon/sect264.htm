<h3>264</h3>

<p>You notice a reptilian guard that is standing on the wide parapet of the bridge. It is leaning on its trident and seems to be staring idly at the river of bubbling lava which flows through the base of the chasm a mile below. Drawing upon your improved Discipline, you focus on this creature and implant the image of its most feared enemy into its mind. The beast begins to tremble uncontrollably. It drops its weapon and, with a howl of abject terror, it slips and falls headlong into the void.</p>
<p>A pair of passing Lavas dive into the chasm, screeching and cawing in alarm. The handful of creatures who are on the bridge at this time immediately rush to the parapet. They are eager to watch as the Lavas attempt to save the falling reptilian before it splashes into the molten river far below. From the sound of their cackling laughter, you get the distinct impression that they are hoping the rescue will be less than successful.</p>
<p>While this ghoulish group are enjoying the sight of their comrade’s plight, you seize the opportunity to make a dash across the bridge.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Assimilance, add 3 to the number you have picked. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 2. If your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score is 10 or lower, deduct 1.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 6 or lower, <a href="sect25.htm">turn to 25</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If your score is 7 or higher, <a href="sect95.htm">turn to 95</a>.</p>
