<h3>286</h3>

<p>You take a running leap at the table and grab the phial from the pillow. Then, as your feet return to the ground, you stagger forwards and throw yourself behind Shamath’s great Throne of Power. Crouching here with fear running cold in your veins, you listen to the hiss of the first crossbow bolts and the screams of the approaching horde. Then you notice the waters of the strange pool which lies no more than a dozen yards away from the throne. Beyond this pool you see the pair of huge black gates which dominates the far wall of the chamber and suddenly you recall the text which appeared in the Tome of Darkness. This is the Pool of Sorrows, and beyond it lie the Gates of Darkness, an exit from this cruel domain. Your feelings of excitement at having discovered a way to escape the approaching horde are tempered when you further recall that you must spill your own blood into the pool if you are to leave this realm successfully.</p>
<p>With little hesitation, you stab a finger against the point of your belt buckle and draw a few droplets of blood. Then you spring to your feet and rush towards the pool. As you come to within a few yards, you flick your finger and a stunning transformation takes place the instant your blood hits the pool’s swirling surface.</p>
<p>(On your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> you may record the phial you have taken as Shamath’s Potion. It is a Backpack Item.)</p>
