<h3>296</h3>

<p>Rimoah picks up a sigil of platinum which is strung upon a loop of braided cord, and he offers it to you.</p>
<p>‘Grand Master, will you please accept this amulet? It possesses powers which may help you survive the rigours of your coming ordeal.’</p>
<p>‘As you wish,’ you reply, and take the amulet from your advisor’s outstretched palm. (Record this Platinum Amulet, which you wear around your neck, as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. You need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>
<p>As you tuck the amulet inside the collar of your robes, Lord Ardan picks up a small package from the table which is wrapped in a silk handkerchief. Carefully he unfolds the patterned silk square to reveal a book which is bound in jet-black hide. A wave of nausea makes you swallow hard as your natural Kai instincts detect that the origins of this book are wholly evil. Ardan offers it to you and, reluctantly this time, you take it from him.</p>
<p>‘It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,’ he says. ‘A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was found buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.’</p>
<p>Carefully you open the stiff black cover and, to your surprise, you discover that the inner pages comprise several sheets of pliable metal. They have the feel of parchment but they sparkle and glimmer like plates of polished steel. You turn through the pages and note that every one appears to be empty, devoid of script, pictures, or diagrams of any sort.</p>
<p>‘I do not see how this book will help my quest,’ you say, as you flick back and forth through the seemingly empty pages.</p>
<p>‘This may be true while you are here in Sommerlund,’ replies Lord Rimoah, ‘but once you arrive upon the Plane of Darkness I suspect that its secrets will be revealed. We of the High Council believe it contains information about the many realms and territories within Naar’s domain. It may help guide you to the location of his throne hall and, with luck, to the Moonstone of the Shianti.’</p>
<p>You are dubious as to the true value of this item but, in deference to Lord Rimoah’s judgement, you agree to take it. (Record this Tome of Darkness on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. As with the Platinum Amulet, you need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect329.htm">turn to 329</a>.</p>
