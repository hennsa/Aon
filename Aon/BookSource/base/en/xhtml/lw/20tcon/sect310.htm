<h3>310</h3>

<p>A halo of light engulfs the razor-sharp blade of your magical sword, illuminating the surrounding gloom of the chasm. The towering warrior roars with anger as this light washes over him; it is as if its goodly glow is causing him great pain. He bellows a phrase in the Dark Tongue and suddenly his broadsword is sheathed with a black fire that crackles and spits venomously. Then the cruel dagger clenched in his left hand begins to glow red. When its poisoned tip becomes white hot, it emits a trail of noxious steam.</p>
<p>You yell your battle-cry as you launch your swift attack, and as your sword hits your enemy’s blade, the sudden release of power knocks him back towards the glowing dragon-gate. Yet he recovers quickly, and when he expertly counters your second blow with the hilt of his black sword, you suddenly realize that you are now embroiled in a desperate fight to the finish.</p>
