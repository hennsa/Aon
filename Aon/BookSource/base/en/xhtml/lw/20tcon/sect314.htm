<h3>314</h3>

<p>You hurry away along a track that winds through the settlement of huts and down to a beach covered with coarse black sand. Here a ramshackle jetty, constructed from wood and bone, protrudes from the lee of a sand dune and out into the sluggish grey sea. Fringing the beach is dense jungle from where there suddenly arises a cacophony of hellish cries. You glimpse shadows moving in the undergrowth, and when you stop momentarily to take a longer look, several arrows come shooting out of the trees. They arc towards you and explode when they hit the sand close by. Your Kai senses warn you that there are a great number of archers lurking in the jungle, far more than you can hope to defeat single-handedly. Anxious to escape while you are still able, you hurry down the beach to the jetty where you discover a sea-going canoe. Without daring to look back, you leap into this canoe, cast off its mooring rope, and paddle as fast as you can away from the shore.</p>
<p>Once you feel sure that you are beyond arrow range, you attempt to follow the coastline in the hope of finding a safer place to put ashore. But a mist sweeps in across the water and engulfs your tiny craft before you can change course. This mist thickens rapidly to become a dense sea fog, the like of which you have never experienced. Despite your advanced Kai skills, you are unable to see through it and quickly you lose all sense of time and direction.</p>

<p>After what seems like many hours, you eventually catch sight of a dark shape low in the water which, at first, appears to be a distant island. You paddle towards it but as you draw closer you sense that all is not what it seems. Then you feel a warm glow radiating from the pocket of your robe and discover that it is the Nza’pok Amulet. Carefully you remove it and, guided purely by instinct, you hold this glowing disc of iron above your head. In the distance you can hear the sound of rushing water which is followed by an incredible sight: the island is sinking slowly into the sea. In less than a minute it has completely disappeared without trace. The amulet no longer glows and so you slip it back into your pocket before continuing your eerie voyage across this uncharted ocean.</p>
