<h3>330</h3>

<p>You retreat from the pile of stones and hurry back to the causeway where you follow the course of this sunken wall for nearly a mile before it sinks without trace into the swamp. Fortunately, you discover a chain of knolls and dry earth mounds by which you are able to continue your trek without falling foul of the swamp’s treacherous pools.</p>
<p>For more than an hour you make your way deeper into this unwholesome morass, yet you encounter no further signs of animal or insect life. A strange quietness overhangs this part of the swamp, an eerie calm which seems to accentuate the aura of evil that is radiating from every mound and murky pool. Progress is slow and an hour passes before you discover another possible place to shelter. It is a tight clump of stunted, thorn-studded trees which stand upon a knoll several hundred yards ahead. You set off towards it, anxious to get under cover even though the rain has already damaged your clothing and equipment. Your cloak is in tatters and your Backpack is full of holes. Briefly you stop to repair your Backpack and discover that three of the items contained within have been ruined. (Delete from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> the items which you have recorded in the last three sections of your Backpack Items list.<sup><a href="#sect330-1-foot" name="sect330-1">13</a></sup>)</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery and have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian or higher, <a href="sect123.htm">turn to 123</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to attain this level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect78.htm">turn to 78</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect330-1-foot" href="#sect330-1">13</a>] It is unclear what to do in this situation if some or all of the last three spaces of your Backpack are empty. One possibility is to interpret this instruction as indicating that the last three items on your list must be erased. Another interpretation is that if some of the last three spaces are empty you are lucky and lose fewer than three items.</p></div>
