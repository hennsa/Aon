<h3>344</h3>

<p>Suddenly the fearsome Dragonlord ceases to roar and spit fire. The wounds you have inflicted have weakened him and he is forced to retreat from the combat momentarily in order to recoup enough strength to continue. Before he can strike again, you use the lull in the deafening noise that has accompanied this fight to shout out the Dragonlord’s secret name.</p>
<p>‘Zheva!’ you cry. Huan’zhor shudders when he hears the name, and a naked panic grips his heart. Bleating like a frightened lamb, the great dragon takes to the air and flees in terror. You watch him fly back across the chasm and soar upwards into the vent in the ceiling of the titanic cavern, from where he first appeared. Your swift and timely use of Huan’zhor’s secret name has routed your enemy. Yet, unfortunately, the Lavas and the reptilian minions do not follow the example of their terrified leader. Sensing an enemy in their midst, they rapidly muster their numbers and encircle the temple. Through the wall of flames you glimpse several dozen Lavas approaching the nest by air from the far side of the chasm. Rather than risk being caught here when they launch their attack, you walk across the floor to the apex of the transporter beam and step in.</p>
