<h3>40</h3>

<p>You see Alyss sitting cross-legged within a globular force-field, her emaciated face and limbs clearly displaying the price she has paid for her continued resistance to the Dark God. Yet despite her wasted physical appearance, you detect that she is still strong in spirit and the Moonstone of the Shianti is still in her possession.</p>
<p>You focus on this force-field and deduce that Naar, having been unable to defeat Alyss in combat, has chosen instead to imprison her within this seamless cell of energy in order to prevent her from using the powers of the Moonstone to create a Shadow Gate through which she can escape. The Dark God has contented himself with waiting for her to weaken to the point where she can no longer resist his remorseless attacks. As you focus on Alyss you sense that she is dangerously close to reaching that breaking point. Prompted by an urge to help her, and by the sight of the Moonstone which she cradles in her lap, you move quickly towards the entrance to Naar’s inner sanctum.</p>
