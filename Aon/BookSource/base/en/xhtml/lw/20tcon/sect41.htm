<h3>41</h3>

<p>You focus on the runes that have been chiselled into the floor. They are similar to those you encountered on the portal to this subterranean labyrinth when first you entered. You feel your pulse quicken when slowly you are able to decipher part of their meaning:</p>
<p>‘Ye who seek entry to the Hall of the Künae, renounce all falsehood and trickery for thou art transparent beneath our gaze. Pay homage to the Lords of Decay lest thy soul be devoured by the insatiable horde of Nemagog. Place gold within the circle for thy wish to be fulfilled, base metal without for thy fate to be sealed.’</p>
<p>With caution guiding your every step, you cross the floor of the chamber and examine the engraved surface of the portal after a gentle push confirms that the door is locked. You had hoped that the runes which cover this great metal portal would reveal how it can be opened, but to your dismay they merely catalogue (in sickening detail) the evil accomplishments of the Künae. Then you discover three small slots: one circular, one square, and one triangular in shape.</p>

<p class="choice">If you have no Gold Crowns, <a href="sect65.htm">turn to 65</a>.</p>
