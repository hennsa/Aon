<h3>53</h3>

<p>You reach to your throat, unbutton the collar of your Kai robes, and withdraw the Platinum Amulet by its braided cord.</p>
<p>‘Ah, I see that you already possess a sigil of power,’ says Lord Rimoah, approvingly. ‘It seems you are better prepared for the quest than we had anticipated.’</p>
<p>With a nod of his head he motions to Lord Ardan who then retrieves an almost identical amulet from among the items on the table. Ardan gives the amulet to Rimoah and he slips it into his pocket.</p>
<p>‘You’ll not be requiring this after all,’ he says, ‘but there is something which I’m sure you will find most useful. And I’m certain that you have not come across anything of its like before.’</p>
<p>Once again Rimoah motions to Ardan and the elderly wizard responds by taking up a small package that is wrapped in a silk handkerchief. Carefully he unfolds the patterned silk square to reveal a book which is bound in jet-black hide. A wave of nausea makes you swallow hard as your natural Kai instincts detect that the origins of this book are wholly evil. Ardan offers it to you and, reluctantly, you take it from him.</p>
<p>‘It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,’ says Ardan. ‘A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.’</p>
<p>Carefully you open the stiff black cover and, to your surprise, you discover that the inner pages comprise several sheets of pliable metal. They have the feel of parchment but they sparkle and glimmer like plates of polished steel. You turn through the pages and note that every one appears to be empty, devoid of script, pictures, or diagrams of any sort.</p>
<p>‘I do not see how this book will help my quest,’ you say, as you flick back and forth through the seemingly empty pages.</p>
<p>‘This may be true while you are here in Sommerlund,’ replies Lord Rimoah, ‘but once you arrive upon the Plane of Darkness I suspect that its secrets will be revealed. We of the High Council believe it contains information about the many realms and territories within Naar’s domain. It may help guide you to the location of his throne hall and, with luck, to the Moonstone of the Shianti.’</p>
<p>You are dubious as to the true value of this item but, in deference to Lord Rimoah’s judgement, you agree to take it. (Record this Tome of Darkness on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect329.htm">turn to 329</a>.</p>
