<h3>57</h3>

<p>As you pass through the curtain of black flames, the three magical items vanish from your hands. (Erase the Nza’pok Amulet, the Künae Ring, and the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon from the Special Items section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)<sup><a href="#sect57-1-foot" name="sect57-1">7</a></sup> Beyond the flaming curtain lies a hall of grey adamanite which is seemingly devoid of all life. You scour this eerie chamber and your senses detect Alyss’s life-force. Hers is the only goodly presence, save your own, in the whole of this evil stronghold, and although her aura is weak, it is sufficient enough for you to be able to track it.</p>
<p>Guided by your instincts and shielded by your Kai Disciplines, you follow Alyss’s trail as it wends its way deeper into the heart of this citadel of Evil. During your exploration you encounter many of Naar’s newest creations who populate the halls and dungeons of Dazganon. Their repugnant forms and depraved and brutal behaviour provide you with an unsavoury insight into Naar’s seemingly infinite capability to create evil and monstrous life forms. You shudder to imagine these foul beings running loose upon your home world of Magnamund, and the thought strengthens your resolve to fulfil your quest for the Moonstone.</p>
<p>For what seems like an hour, your camouflage and psychic skills make you invisible to the creatures that dwell within Dazganon. It is not until you reach a busy junction at the heart of a maze of tunnels that your skills are truly put to the test. Your senses detect the presence of Alyss at the end of an adjacent tunnel, yet the entrance to this wide passage is virtually blocked by creatures who are bickering with Naar’s armed guards.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Assimilance, add 2 to the number you have picked. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, or Grand Pathsmanship, add 1. Also, for every level of Kai Mastery you have attained above the rank of Kai Grand Guardian, add a further 1.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 3 or less, <a href="sect189.htm">turn to 189</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4 or higher, <a href="sect116.htm">turn to 116</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect57-1-foot" href="#sect57-1">7</a>] This is the correct answer to the total of the numbers on the three Special Items required to enter Dazganon (cf. Sections <a href="sect297.htm">297</a> and <a href="sect338.htm">338</a>).</p></div>
