<h3>67</h3>

<p>The causeway comprises a procession of cracked grey blocks of stone which cross this fetid land and trail away towards a tangle of jungle vegetation that stretches across the horizon. In places the mouldering pavement disappears completely beneath the surface, swallowed by the swamp, yet the encroaching mud is shallow and it does not hamper your progress too greatly. On either side of this swamp-road you notice an occasional spur of rock protruding through the mire. Then you see the apex of a stone roof and a broken spire and suddenly you realize that they are segments of buildings. They are all that remain visible of an ancient city which has long since drowned beneath the swamp. The causeway is not a road at all; it is the remnants of the city’s fortified wall.</p>
<p>The cloudy green sky begins to darken and you sense a storm approaching. Minutes later, a gentle rain begins to fall which turns the surface of the swamp a milky shade of blue. You raise the hood of your cloak and press on, but suddenly you notice that your clothes are giving off wisps of smoke where they have been spattered by the rain. The rain is not water: it is a corrosive acid. Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus protects your flesh from the effects of this acidic rain, but your clothing and equipment are vulnerable to its effect. Rather than risk losing them, you look around for some place to shelter from the coming storm. The only cover that you are able to discern is a large mound of fallen stone slabs several hundred yards away to your right.</p>
