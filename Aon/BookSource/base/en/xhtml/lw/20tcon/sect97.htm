<h3>97</h3>

<p>A feeling of dread makes your hands tremble the moment you catch a clear sight of the huge, ant-like creatures. You have encountered these insectoids once before, although in a location which could not be more different than the humid jungle settlement into which you are now descending. They are Dentaag, giant spindly-limbed insectoids who possess ghoulish heads implanted with evil composite eyes. They are an ancient breed, a cruel creation spawned by Naar for the armies of the Deathlord of Ixia. It was in the Deathlord’s frigid chamber, atop the Spire of Xaagon, that you last faced these terrible creatures and you had hoped then that your first encounter with them would also be your last. Fate has decreed otherwise.</p>
<p>Memories of your ordeal in Ixia suddenly come flooding back to haunt you. As you recall your previous encounter, you remember that these horrific beings possess strong psychic powers. Forewarned, you draw upon your mental Kai defences as your captors prepare to land with you inside the settlement.</p>

<p class="choice">If you do not possess this Discipline, <a href="sect59.htm">turn to 59</a>.</p>
