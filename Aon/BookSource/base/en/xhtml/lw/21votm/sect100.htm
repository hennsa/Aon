<h3>100</h3>

<p>The <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> approaches Bisutan harbour late in the afternoon. The city itself is located upon an island in the estuary of the River Khorda and is linked to the mainland by two great stone bridges. You admire these wondrous spans from afar as the ship takes its place in a line of vessels that are waiting to dock at the crowded quayside. The magnificent harbour is full of people who have come here from the four corners of Magnamund to trade their wares. Travellers, merchants, farmers, priests, and slaves are just a few of the people you observe when finally the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> is allowed to dock at the harbour wall.</p>
<p>Kol’s trading partners are already waiting on the quayside to meet the ship. They are anxious to do business with him, but the battered state of the ship following yesterday’s storm does little to inspire their confidence. The moment the gangplank is lowered, they come rushing aboard to inspect the timber in the hold. Kol bids you a hurried farewell as he and his crew thank you once more for saving their lives and their livelihoods. You disembark and push your way through the busy harbour square and enter a broad avenue which leads to the heart of this teeming city. At a place called Dhanamet Square you happen upon an evening bazaar. You are mindful of your need to find lodging for the night and some means by which you will be able to continue your journey to Elzian. As you stop to look at the market and the façades of the shops and taverns which border upon it, your eye is caught by the gaily-decorated merchant’s stalls and the exotic wares displayed upon them.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take a closer look at the market stalls, <a href="sect7.htm">turn to 7</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose instead to try to find a place to stay for the night, <a href="sect236.htm">turn to 236</a>.</p>
