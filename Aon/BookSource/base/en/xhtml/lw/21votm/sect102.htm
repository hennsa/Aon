<h3>102</h3>

<p>You use your Kai healing skills to revive the old man and calm his trembling limbs. Then you help him to sit up and, when he has regained his composure, he looks into your eyes and says:</p>
<p>‘You are one of the Kai, yes?’ You nod your head and a smile deepens the wrinkles around his mouth. ‘You possess a stone of power … a legendary stone?’ This time you hesitate, but you sense that it is a rhetorical question: the old man already knows the answer. Briefly he searches among his pillows and retrieves a leather-bound tube. He flips open one end of the tube and tips a plain-looking ring into the palm of his hand. It seems to be crafted from petrified wood.</p>
<p>‘Take this, Kai Lord,’ he says, and proffers you the ring. ‘It will keep you safe on your long journey. That which you seek to return <em>must</em> be delivered.’</p>
<p>You take the ring and place it in the pocket of your tunic (record Temujun’s Ring as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>). The old man smiles once more and, although no words are exchanged, you sense that he is deeply satisfied to be able to assist your vital mission.</p>
<p>You thank him and leave his tent. Once outside, you walk down to the edge of the oasis to bathe your face and drink the warm, fresh water. The yellow flames of the campfire are glimmering on its surface and you pause to consider joining the travellers who are seated around it, enjoying the show.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to go to the campfire, <a href="sect40.htm">turn to 40</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to retire to the empty carriage and get some sleep, <a href="sect290.htm">turn instead to 290</a>.</p>
