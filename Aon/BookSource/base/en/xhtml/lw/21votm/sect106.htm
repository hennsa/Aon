<h3>106</h3>

<p>You find your room at the end of a corridor on the first floor and you are pleased to discover that it is clean and well furnished. You fall asleep within minutes of lying down upon the feather-mattressed bed, yet it seems as if you have barely closed your eyes when, two hours later, you are rudely awoken by noises in the taproom below. The clomp of iron-shod boots and the hubbub of angry voices make you leap from your bed and reach for your weapon. Quickly you gather your equipment and cloak and ease open the door to your room. Outside in the corridor you see your companions; like you they have been awoken by the commotion downstairs.</p>
<p>‘It’s the City Guard,’ whispers Oswin, who is peering down the stairwell. Then the tavern-keeper appears and he comes rushing up the stairs. His face is red as a beetroot and he is shaking with fright. ‘The … the Funtal of Bir Rabalou’s men are here,’ he says, his voice wavering. ‘They’ve had word that there are assassins abroad in the harbour and they’re checking all foreigners. You’re to go down to the taproom at once.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to comply with the tavern-keeper’s request to go downstairs to the taproom, <a href="sect33.htm">turn to 33</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If instead you choose to ignore his request, you can search for somewhere to hide from the City Guard by <a href="sect2.htm">turning to 2</a>.</p>
