<h3>108</h3>

<p>Together with Paoll and a party of five armed marines, you row ashore in the ship’s longboat. With weapons drawn, you and your search party sift through the ruins of Khadro’s encampment but find few items of any practical value. There are several tracks which have been made by the creatures you glimpsed earlier, but they all lead away into the surrounding jungle and you can no longer detect their presence.</p>
<p>Mindful of the risk you are taking simply by being here on the island, away from the ship, you signal to the men to return to the longboat. As you are descending the beach, you trip accidentally upon something half-buried in the black sand. Closer inspection reveals it to be a fist-sized ball of iron that has been crafted into the shape of a human skull. (If you wish to keep this Iron Skull, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry in the pocket of your tunic.)</p>
