<h3>11</h3>

<p>When the dust settles you see that the Koneshi Pass is now blocked and completely impassable. You shout to the marines on the other side to let them know that you are safe, and you hear them calling back, but even with your acute Kai sense of hearing you are unable to make out clearly what they are shouting.</p>
<p>However, by drawing upon your Magnakai skill of Divination you are able to make telepathic contact with Sligh. By way of mental commands and suggestions you tell him to lead his comrades back to Bir Rabalou where they are to sell their horses to raise the money they will need to buy passage home aboard a trading ship. Sligh is unable to answer you telepathically, but you sense that he will comply with your suggestions. Wary of the risk of further landslides, you turn your horse around and ride off along the open mountain trail towards the south.</p>
