<h3>149</h3>

<p>As you pull open the tent flap you see that Temujun’s young assistant is standing immediately outside. He peers around you and sees his master lying unconscious among his pillows.</p>
<p>‘A thousand apologies, sire,’ he says, nervously wringing his hands. ‘My master is an old man and he gets tired. Please, do not be offended. He often falls asleep during a consultation. Here, you may have your money back … ’ And with this, he takes 2 Gold Crowns from his purse and presses them into your hand (restore these 2 Gold Crowns to your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>).</p>
<p>The waiting queue groan with disappointment when the young boy tells them there will be no further consultations with his master tonight. As he returns their money, you walk down to the edge of the oasis to bathe your face and drink the warm, fresh water. The yellow flames of the campfire are glimmering on its surface and you pause to consider joining the travellers who are seated nearby, enjoying the show.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to go to the campfire, <a href="sect40.htm">turn to 40</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose instead to retire to the empty carriage and get some sleep, <a href="sect290.htm">turn instead to 290</a>.</p>
