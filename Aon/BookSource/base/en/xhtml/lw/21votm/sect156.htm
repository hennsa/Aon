<h3>156</h3>

<p>The road becomes increasingly tortuous as it traverses the central reaches of the Koneshi Mountains. Long winding climbs around precipitous cliffs are followed by steep descents into wooded ravines which test your nerve and your horsemanship to the full. Among the trunks of the blond Vassagonian mountain pines which border this route you glimpse the feral eyes of hungry timber wolves. Their howling disturbs the horses and you are forced to use your Kai skills throughout this difficult crossing to keep all four of the steeds calm and controllable.</p>
<p>It is a little after midday when you hear the rumble of thunder echoing through the surrounding peaks. You suspect a storm must be approaching, yet the sky above is clear and your keen senses detect no winds nor any change in atmospheric pressures. Later, as the trail passes around a steep cliff-face, you see the cause of the rumbling: ahead the narrow trail is blocked by a landslide. The dust has settled and, when you magnify your vision, you think you can see a way to cross the mound of broken rocks. You tell the marines to wait for you while you go ahead to check if it is safe for you all to proceed. You are picking your way cautiously across the rockfall when suddenly a loud roar fills your ears and you look up to see a thousand tons of loose shale come tumbling down the mountainside. It is too narrow to turn your horse about and so you dig your heels into his flanks and urge him forwards. To your horror, he panics and rears up on his hind legs in an attempt to throw you off his back.</p>
