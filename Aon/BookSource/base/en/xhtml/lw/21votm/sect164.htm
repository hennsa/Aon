<h3>164</h3>

<p>The young ticket seller is sad to see the look of disappointment on your face when you discover that you do not have enough money for the caravan fare to Bavari. She whispers in the ear of her father, one of the owners, and with a shrug of his shoulders he consents to his daughter’s request. The young girl beckons you to approach her table and she offers to accept one of your Weapons or two of your Backpack Items in exchange for a place aboard a passenger wagon. (Erase either 1 Weapon or 2 Backpack Items from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>The young girl smiles as she paints a dot of indelible crimson ink upon the back of your right hand to indicate that you have paid your fare. A few minutes later, an outrider comes cantering down the line of parked wagons announcing to everyone that the caravan will depart in five minutes’ time. With mixed feelings of trepidation and excitement, you take a seat aboard one of the spacious passenger wagons and make yourself as comfortable as you can for the long journey ahead.</p>
