<h3>172</h3>

<p>At the entrance to the village stands a ramshackle inn constructed from sandstone, driftwood, and canvas. A creaking sign above its door says: ‘The Serene Funtal’. Sligh laughs when he reads this—‘Ha, I’d wager this weren’t named after that mangy cur who rules Bir Rabalou now, that’s for sure.’</p>
<p>A lean-to built from old ship’s timbers provides shelter for the horses. Two fresh-faced young boys take charge and you can tell by the skilful way they handle them that your steeds are in good hands. The inn itself, despite its dilapidation, has a warm and friendly feel. The owner seems genuinely pleased to see you and he is helpful almost to a fault. Food and lodging for the night is 12 Gold Crowns. The marines are able to scrape together six Crowns, leaving it to you to come up with the remaining six.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess 6 Gold Crowns and wish to pay the balance of the bill, <a href="sect95.htm">turn to 95</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess sufficient Gold Crowns, or if you do not wish to pay the balance, <a href="sect58.htm">turn to 58</a>.</p>
