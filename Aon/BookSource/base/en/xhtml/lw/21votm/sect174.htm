<h3>174</h3>

<p>Oriah accompanies you as you make your way quickly towards the stone steps. The marines stay on the surface and observe the riders while the two of you investigate where these mysterious steps lead. Together you descend fifty feet into the ground and arrive at a chamber that is littered with skulls and human bones. There is a carved archway near the bottom of the steps but it is sealed by a slab of grey marble. As you inch your way towards it, you try to decipher some of the engravings which embellish its surface. They are in an ancient script, yet you are able to determine their meaning: they are clues to the number which must be spoken aloud if you wish for the portal to open.</p>
<p>To discover the number which will make this portal open, you must first determine the distance (in miles) of your journey from Holmgard to Elzian. Having found this number you must then divide it by the number of Grand Master Disciplines which exist.</p>
<p class="puzzle">If you are able to calculate the answer from these two clues, <a href="numbered.htm">turn now to the section</a> which has the same number as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect174-1-foot" name="sect174-1">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you are unable to determine the correct answer, or if you choose not to open this portal, <a href="sect39.htm">turn instead to 39</a>.</p>
