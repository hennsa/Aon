<h3>176</h3>

<p>You accompany the captain back to <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> where you are welcomed aboard by two men—First Mate Paoll, and a fair-haired young man whose blue surcoat is emblazoned with the scarlet anchor of the Kirlundin Isles.</p>
<p>‘My name’s Dryan—Sergeant Dryan of the 1st Kirlundin Marines,’ says the proud young man. ‘I’ve a dozen marines in my charge and we’ve been assigned a tour of duty aboard this ship for the duration of its voyage south.’</p>
<p>Paoll is eager to show you to your cabin which is situated at the stern, next to the captain’s quarters, but you decline his offer. Instead you speak further with Sergeant Dryan and learn that he and his marines have been ordered aboard the ship by King Ulnar. Dryan’s instructions are to protect the ship’s cargo from the threat of pirate attack. At first you are suspicious; in his briefing Lone Wolf said nothing about an escort of marines. To determine whether Dryan is telling the truth, you probe the sergeant’s mind using your psychic Kai skills and discover at once that he is genuine. He does not know or suspect the true purpose of your journey.</p>
<p>‘Well I’m glad to be sharing this voyage with you and your men,’ you say. ‘It makes me feel much safer knowing we have marines on board.’</p>
<p>You salute the sergeant and he goes off to attend to his men. Then Captain Raker turns to his First Mate and bellows: ‘Alright, Paoll. Set the crew to work. I want us to catch the ebb tide within the hour.’</p>
