<h3>188</h3>

<p>The road from Hikas to Gologo is an ancient trail which crosses rich plantations of tropical crops that are cultivated by the Vakeros, and then meanders through wild expanses of jungle that have for centuries defied all attempts at cultivation. As you ride this lush road, you are reminded of your history lessons at the Kai Monastery and you recall some of the things you were taught about this ancient realm.</p>
<p>Dessi is ruled by the Elder Magi who are all that remain of a race of great magicians who once ruled central Magnamund thousands of years ago. They were the first practitioners of magic upon this world, and they were wise and powerful leaders until their numbers were decimated by a Great Plague that was released by their enemies—the Cener Druids of Ruel. Those who survived sought refuge here in fertile Dessi and have lived here ever since.</p>
<p>At noon you reach a place where the road passes beside a majestic waterfall, and you stop here to rest your horse and enjoy the beautiful scenery. (Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.) Then you continue your ride and your strong horse makes excellent progress, carrying you all the way to the coastal town of Gologo to arrive there shortly before sunset.</p>
