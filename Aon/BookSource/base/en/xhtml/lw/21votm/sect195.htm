<h3>195</h3>

<p>You step back from the body of the last henchman to fall to your deadly blows, and you move to take hold of Oriah by the hand before making a hasty escape from the square. But as you turn on your heels you discover that she is no longer behind you. Then you hear her scream and when you look up you see that she is being carried away on the back of a gigantic bird.</p>
<p>It is an Itikar, a huge Vassagonian eagle, and seated astride its feathered neck is a warrior who has taken Oriah captive during your fight with the slaver’s henchmen. Desperately you race after the great bird as it carries her away over the rooftops of Kilij, yet as you sprint across the square you see a dozen armed men emerge from the watching crowd to block your path. The Itikar and its precious cargo are rapidly disappearing towards the northern hills and you know now in your heart that it is too late to save Oriah. Then you hear the sound of cruel laughter echoing across the square and it brings you skidding to a halt. It is the laugh of the slaver: he can barely contain his delight at having captured such a beautiful young woman, and he is relishing the thought of watching as the remainder of his henchmen make you pay for the deaths of their comrades.</p>
<p>Swiftly you assess your perilous situation and determine two ways in which you may save yourself from the slaver’s gang of bloodthirsty thugs.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to run back across the square and attack the slaver, <a href="sect78.htm">turn to 78</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to reach the town’s bazaar and find the marines, <a href="sect126.htm">turn to 126</a>.</p>
