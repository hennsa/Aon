<h3>220</h3>

<p>Circling above a column of rocks are six large, black-winged birds. You magnify your vision and instantly you recognize them to be Itikars—giant Vassagonian eagles. The leader of this predatory group has golden markings on his wing tips that glint in the sun, giving them a metallic appearance, and when he sees the balloon approaching he veers away from the column. The others follow his lead and all six come flying towards you in a wedge-shaped formation.</p>
<p>They fly past overhead and stare down at the balloon with their cold black eyes. Then the leader turns about and you sense that he intends to attack you on his next pass. His companions form up behind him in a line and he leads them in a steep dive.</p>
<p>As he comes to within a hundred feet, he spreads his razor-sharp talons and fixes his cruel eyes on the balloon’s vulnerable canopy.</p>
