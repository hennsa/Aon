<h3>230</h3>

<p>You watch with fearful anticipation as the second wave of enemy raiders come leaping aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. The ship’s crew and the marines have suffered many casualties and they are now too weak and exhausted to be able to repel this renewed assault. You know that you must act quickly if you are to avert a disaster.</p>
<p>Steeling yourself, you tighten your grip on your weapon and leap from the rigging as the enemy leader passes below the mainmast. You hit the armoured warrior feet-first and slam him to the deck, but he quickly recovers from this surprise attack and, in the ensuing struggle, he manages to kick the weapon from your hand.</p>
<p>‘Leave this one to me!’ he screams, warning off his henchmen who are poised to rush forward and cut you down. He unsheathes his scimitar and, with a sneer fixed to his cruel lips, he raises the blade in readiness to strike at your head.</p>
<p class="combat">Dar-Isun: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 39   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 38</p>
<p>You must fight the first round of this combat empty-handed. If you possess a close-combat weapon, you may use it from the beginning of the second round.</p>
