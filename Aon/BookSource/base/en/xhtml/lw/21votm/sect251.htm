<h3>251</h3>

<p>You tie your horse’s reins to a post driven into the ground at the edge of the beach, and then you walk across the fine white sand and pass among the throng of dancing, singing people. A pulsating rhythm of native drums provides the music to which they move and play. You are caught up in a procession of gaily-dressed Vakeros who are each carrying baskets piled high with exotic fruits, works of art, and intricate wood carvings inlaid with semi-precious stones. To the rhythm of the drums they carry you with them towards a wooden platform constructed near the middle of the beach. There they place their offerings to the Goddess Ishir. When you find yourself standing at this platform, at the head of the procession, suddenly the drumming stops. Everyone who has approached the platform before you has made an offering and yet your hands are empty. Suddenly it is as if the eyes of the entire town are watching you in expectation, and you feel compelled to make an offering.<sup><a href="#sect251-1-foot" name="sect251-1">7</a></sup></p>
