<h3>263</h3>

<p>You watch as Captain Raker takes over the helm from his First Mate and attempts to manoeuvre the ship out of the path of the oncoming vessels. The leading pirate ship has now closed to within fifty yards and its murderous crew are crowded shoulder-to-shoulder upon its forward deck. Clearly they intend to leap aboard as soon as their ship draws alongside. From your position beside the deck rail you can see Sergeant Dryan directing his men at the bow. Dryan’s marines are busily loading the three swivel cannon which are fixed to the port gunwale. Once loaded, each marine gunner raises his hand to signal that his piece is primed to fire. Dryan is waiting for the third gunner to signal. He is ready to give the order to fire when suddenly there is a thunderous roar and a puff of grey smoke erupts unexpectedly from the prow of the attacking ship.</p>
