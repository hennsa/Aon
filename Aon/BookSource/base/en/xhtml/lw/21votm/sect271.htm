<h3>271</h3>

<p>The old man places his hand over the torn cloth, mumbles a few words, and when he removes it you see that the fibres have knitted together and your cloak is now as good as new. At once your Magnakai senses tell you that he has used the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mend</i> to repair your garment.</p>
<p>‘Just a little trick I learned in Toran,’ he says jocularly. Then he raises his box-like contraption and sighs: ‘Alas, ’tis a pity I can’t use the same trick to fix this convexor. I was never much good with machines.’</p>
<p>He looks at the box and then at you and a flicker of recognition passes across his wizened face. ‘You’re Sommlending, aren’t you?’ he says, and then he moves a little closer and inspects your tunic and cloak. ‘By the bells of Teph! You’re a Kai! Well, well, bless my soul!’ And with this the old man begins to reminisce about the part he played in the Darklands War, how the peoples of Northern Magnamund owe their lives to your illustrious leader—Lone Wolf—and how appreciative he is of the Kai’s tireless fight against the forces of Naar. It is clear by his enthusiasm that he is honoured to have made your acquaintance. When finally he finishes his gushing eulogy he offers to buy you an evening meal.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to accept his offer, <a href="sect159.htm">turn to 159</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to decline his offer, you may bid him goodnight and go to your room by <a href="sect213.htm">turning to 213</a>.</p>
