<h3>274</h3>

<p>You scramble to your feet and pause to unsheathe a hand weapon before you struggle across the heaving deck and regain your position at the ship’s rail. The enemy vessel has rammed <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> and now a host of screaming warriors is swarming aboard your stricken ship. A shadow passes overhead and when you look up you see the giant spider scurrying towards the crow’s nest. The Sommlending lookout shrieks hysterically and, in blind panic, throws himself into the sea to avoid being consumed by this hideous monster. Through the smoke which shrouds the deck below you can see Sergeant Dryan and his men fighting bravely to repel the raiders. Those of Raker’s crew who have survived the collision hurriedly arm themselves and rush to support the outnumbered marines, but they are not trained fighters and they are clearly no match for this ruthless enemy.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to descend to the deck below and fight alongside Sergeant Dryan’s marines, <a href="sect331.htm">turn to 331</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose instead to climb the rigging and attack the giant spider that is now perched upon the crow’s nest, <a href="sect299.htm">turn to 299</a>.</p>
