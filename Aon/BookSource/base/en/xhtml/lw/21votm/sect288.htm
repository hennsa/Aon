<h3>288</h3>

<p>You stare across the ocean at the banks of angry clouds which are growing larger and darker with every passing minute. You sense that within them are tremendous natural forces that are building up at a dangerous rate. You feel certain that the presence of the Moonstone is partially responsible for this, although these waters are notorious for sudden and violent sea-storms.</p>
<p>You warn Kol of the distant storm and the disastrous effect that it could have if it were to break upon his cargo-heavy ship. You urge him to turn back to Bir Rabalou but he dismisses your request out of hand. He says that the storm is many miles away, and even if it were to move nearer he is confident that the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> is still swift enough to outrun it. You believe that he is wrong and you are angered by his complacency, but there is nothing you can say that will make him, or his crew, turn this ship about. He is the master of this vessel and his loyal crew will only obey his command.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mind Charm</i> to make Kol turn back to Bir Rabalou, <a href="sect46.htm">turn to 46</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you choose not to use it, you must accept Kol’s decision to continue with the voyage to Bisutan. <a href="sect269.htm">Turn to 269</a>.</p>
