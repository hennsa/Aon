<h3>306</h3>

<p>Using your innate Magnakai skills, you magnify your vision and scan the island. The shoreline appears deserted, but when you cast your eyes towards the east you notice two tiny specks on the horizon. You alert Captain Raker to the threat but he dismisses your warning, saying it is merely heat haze.</p>
<p>Several minutes later the ship’s lookout confirms that there are two ships on the eastern horizon. Raker brings his telescope to bear and after a few moments’ observation he says: ‘You were right, my lord. I should have known better than to doubt the eyes of a Kai.’</p>
<p>Lowering his telescope, he turns and shouts an order to Paoll: ‘South by southwest, if you please, First Mate. Looks like we’ve got comp’ny!’</p>
<p>The timbers creak as the ship turns about and forges a new passage through deep water. Following the change of bearing the wind is now no longer in your favour and Paoll is forced to tack against it to make headway. The lighter ships have the advantage and they quickly draw closer. Soon you can see that they are Vassagonian men-o’-war, although they fly no flags of allegiance or origin. Judging by their poor general condition it is clear that they are pirate raiders. Raker orders his men to their battle positions and Sergeant Dryan issues an order to his marines to stand ready at the cannons as the pirate raiders bear down upon the port bow.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stay with Captain Raker on the rear deck, <a href="sect263.htm">turn to 263</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to stand with Sergeant Dryan at the port bow, <a href="sect144.htm">turn to 144</a>.</p>
