<h3>34</h3>

<p>You spend an hour enjoying the carnival spirit of the beach festival before you return to your horse and go in search of a place to stay for the night. You ride along a street running parallel to the beach, and enter the courtyard of a large two-storey hostel with stables. A young boy takes your horse’s reins and leads him away to an enclosure at the side of this brightly-painted building, and you enter the hostel’s front door to find it is empty. It seems that everyone is down at the beach this evening. Then you hear a noise from beyond an open doorway and a balding man appears. He rubs his bloodshot eyes and yawns, revealing a mouthful of gold teeth. You ask if he has a room for the night and lazily he nods his head.</p>
<p>‘I’ve two types of room and service,’ he says. ‘There’s Standard and there’s Best. Standard costs 2 Gold Crowns a night and you don’t get no food. Best costs 4 Gold Crowns and you get lots of food in the morning.’ (If you do not have enough Gold Crowns, you may choose to barter a normal Weapon, Backpack Item, or Special Item at your discretion to buy a Standard room.)</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to buy a Standard room for the night, <a href="sect216.htm">turn to 216</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to buy a Best room, <a href="sect138.htm">turn to 138</a>.</p>
