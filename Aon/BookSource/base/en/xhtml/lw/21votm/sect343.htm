<h3>343</h3>

<p>After having stripped to your undergarments and locked your tunic and equipment safely away in your cabin, you join Oriah at the bow of the ship where you prepare to enter the sea together. Fernant and Raker watch from the forward deck as the two of you leap into the warm waters of the cove and make your first dive upon the wreck. Oriah is a strong swimmer, and you can tell by the effortless way she descends through the water that she is a skilled diver.</p>
<p>The galleon is broken at its centre and lies with its fore and aft sections separated by an expanse of debris-strewn sand. As you view the halves of the wreck, two areas of particular interest catch your eye: a gaping hole in the hull of the forward section, and a cabin located on the rear poop deck.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the hole in the hull, <a href="sect117.htm">turn to 117</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the cabin on the rear deck, <a href="sect184.htm">turn to 184</a>.</p>
