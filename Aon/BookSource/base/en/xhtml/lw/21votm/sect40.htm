<h3>40</h3>

<p>You seat yourself near the crackling campfire and one of your fellow passengers offers you a piece of fruit which you gratefully accept. The troupe are gifted acrobats and jugglers and the performances they give are very entertaining. During their act the leader of the troupe climbs upon a large barrel and challenges the audience to answer a riddle:</p>
<p>‘An old, one-legged farmer, his wife, his dog, his horse, and his cows, have 103 legs between them. How many cows does the old farmer have?’</p>
<p>The leader is sure that nobody will answer his riddle correctly. He is so sure that he offers 10 Gold Crowns to anyone who can give him the correct answer in less than thirty seconds.</p>
<p class="puzzle">If you would like to accept this challenge, use the second hand of a clock or a wristwatch to time yourself while you work out the answer. If you complete the riddle in 30 seconds or less, <a href="numbered.htm">turn to the section number</a> that is the same as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect40-1-foot" name="sect40-1">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you run out of time, or if you choose not to answer the riddle, <a href="sect241.htm">turn instead to 241</a>.</p>
