<h3>42</h3>

<p>You scan the distant island, using your Grand Master Discipline to enhance your innate visual skills. The shoreline appears deserted, but when you cast your gaze towards the east you notice several dots on the horizon. You alert Captain Raker and he brings his telescope to bear. After a few moments’ observation he shouts an order to Paoll: ‘South by southwest, if you please, First Mate. Looks like we’ve got comp’ny!’</p>
<p>The timbers creak as the ship turns about and forges a passage through deep water. Following the change of bearing the wind is now no longer in your favour and Paoll is forced to tack against it to make progress. The distant ships are now visible and it is clear to all aboard that they are pirate raiders. Soon another two islands rise into view and the captain orders his First Mate to steer a course towards a narrow channel which separates them.</p>
<p>‘That’s the Bukimi Channel,’ says Raker. ‘If we can pass through afore those sea dogs, we’ll pick up southerly winds on the far side. Then they’ll never catch us!’</p>
