<h3>46</h3>

<p>Kol is susceptible to your psychic suggestions and he obeys your mental order to turn the ship around. At first his crew are shocked and puzzled when suddenly he commands them to change course, but they do not question his decision. Silently they obey their master and within minutes the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> is sailing back to Bir Rabalou.</p>
<p>You return to the city’s harbour at dusk where you are met by a dozen of the Funtal’s guardsmen who are checking ships along the quayside. Kol recognizes their officer—he is a man called Jhioua and he is an old friend of his. Eventually a gangplank is lowered and Kol steps briskly ashore to engage his friend in conversation. With the officer distracted, you now use your Kai camouflage skills to evade the wary eyes of his guardsmen and escape from the ship.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess the Discipline of Assimilance, add 3 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 4 or lower, <a href="sect135.htm">turn to 135</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5 or higher, <a href="sect4.htm">turn to 4</a>.</p>
