<h3>67</h3>

<p>By the skill of her crew and helmsman, <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> enters the Bukimi Channel and picks up a prevailing wind which propels her swiftly away from the pirate raiders. Soon the enemy ships have disappeared beyond the distant horizon. When Raker is sure that they have abandoned the chase, he praises his First Mate and crew and promises that tonight they can look forward to a double rum ration as reward for their skilful seamanship.</p>
<p>As the ship navigates the narrow strait dividing these two Lakuri islands, you pass close by the fire-blackened ruins of a beach settlement which nestles in a bay overshadowed by cliffs. It is Kita Cove, formerly the secret base from where Captain Khadro launched his pirate fleet. Staring at the charred remnants of his settlement, you try to imagine what it must have looked like before the encampment was consumed by the tremendous fireball that was to seal its doom.</p>
<p>A mile beyond Kita Cove, the strait becomes narrower at a place where it passes between two overhanging cliffs. Paoll is sure that he can navigate safely through this channel, but his confidence is shaken when the lookout suddenly screams a warning: ‘Whirlpool ahead!’</p>
<p>When you catch sight of the swirling, foaming water, you sense immediately that this is not a natural phenomenon: this watery vortex is the result of evil sorcery.</p>
