<h3>83</h3>

<p>The man snakes his way through the crowd with surprising speed. He is fast and agile, but he is no match for a Kai Grand Master and you quickly catch him. Your suspicions were correct: he is clasping to his chest an item from your Backpack (the first item on your list). Having been caught red-handed, this wily thief now tries to turn the tables on you. He screams at the top of his voice that you are robbing him. His wailing cries attract the crowd’s attention and soon you find yourself surrounded by a score of scowling faces, all looking accusingly at you.</p>

<p class="choice">If you possess the Discipline of Bardsmanship and wish to use it, <a href="sect286.htm">turn to 286</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess neither of these skills, or if you choose not to use them, <a href="sect318.htm">turn to 318</a>.</p>
