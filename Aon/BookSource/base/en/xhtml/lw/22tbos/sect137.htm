<h3>137</h3>

<p>Three miles from the village you discover a jungle trail. You keep to this trail and stay on the move all night, foregoing rest in order to distance yourself from the hostile natives. Shortly before dawn, you crest a wooded ridge and see the port of Masama in the distance. It lies astride a wide river that is dotted with many trading ships and fishing boats.</p>
<p>As you approach the port, your muddy and dishevelled appearance attracts jibes from the children of Masama. Stung by their rude remarks, you decide that you are in desperate need of a bath and so you go down to the river bank to wash away the worst of the grime. While you are here you notice that the two halves of the town are connected by a series of wooden bridges. The opposite side of the river is home to the business district. Here are wharves and warehouses and a quay that is filled to overflowing with trading ships and barges. The <cite>Seasprite</cite> was bound for this port, and although you cannot see her moored among the scores of ships at the quay, you decide to go there and check if Radyard and his crew are still in port.</p>
<p>You cross the river by bridge and enter a market square bordered by warehouses, taverns, and busy trade emporia that are crowded with foreign crews. As your keen eye wanders around this bustling scene, you try to decide where first to look for Radyard and his men.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish enquire at Ljama’s Emporium, <a href="sect180.htm">turn to 180</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to enter the Great Masama Warehouse &amp; Trading Post, <a href="sect97.htm">turn to 97</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to try at the Freetrader’s Tavern, <a href="sect30.htm">turn to 30</a>.</p>
