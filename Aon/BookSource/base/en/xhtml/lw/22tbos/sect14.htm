<h3>14</h3>

<p>Quickly you take your musical instrument from your backpack and play the first few verses of the Eldenoran national anthem, entitled ‘Mighty Duadon’. The loutish Eldenorans begin to cheer and stamp on the taproom floor in time to the music when they recognize their banal battle song. Soon they are all singing along, including the captain who releases his grip and lets the gasping crewman drop in a heap to the taproom floor as he joins in with the chorus.</p>
<p>You motion to the others that now would be a good time to leave. Without a word they move towards the door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade as they go. The Eldenorans are soon singing so loudly that they do not notice when you cease playing and hurry out of the tavern. You join the others outside and laugh with them at the incredible stupidity of the Eldenorans. It is hollow laughter, but at least it helps to relieve the frustration of having to return early to <cite>The Azan</cite>.</p>
