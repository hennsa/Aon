<h3>141</h3>

<p>Your advanced healing skills tell you that the owner of the shop is a very sick man. You sense that his illness is caused by his constant exposure to the vapours from dyes and potions that he keeps in stock. You offer to help cure him of his ailment and at first he is sceptical. In the past he has wasted hundreds of Nobles on physicians and their quack remedies, and all to no avail. It is not until you offer to treat him without charge that he has a sudden change of heart.</p>
<p>You place one hand on his chest and the other on his forehead. Then you concentrate on projecting your healing power into his body and you sense that toxins in his blood are beginning to disappear. Gradually his damaged internal organs rejuvenate and his skin takes on a healthy glow.</p>
<p>Astonished and delighted by the miraculous recovery you have brought about, the shopkeeper takes from around his neck a valuable emerald medallion and he insists that you accept it as a token of his thanks.</p>
<p>If you wish to accept this Emerald Medallion, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep in your pocket.</p>
