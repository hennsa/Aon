<h3>144</h3>

<p>The crew are in good spirits by the time you arrive at the Three Capstans Inn. The owner, a pot-bellied man with an oddly childlike face, welcomes the Suhnese with open arms and he orders his son to be generous with the ale. The tavern has three taprooms which are all busy, but not overcrowded, and in each area there is a minstrel and a juggler to entertain the patrons. During the course of the evening you learn that these raucous performers are all members of the owner’s family.</p>
<p>The entertainments continue for most of the evening until the joyful mood is unexpectedly soured by the arrival of an Eldenoran crew, led by their boorish captain. These coarse, loud-mouthed thugs seem to delight in hurling cheap insults at the Suhnese. Stoically the crew ignore the abuse, quietly hoping that the Eldenorans will soon tire of goading them and leave, but then one of Jenkshi’s men rails against a racial slur and in a moment of anger he yells at them to shut their foul mouths. For a few moments the tavern is filled with a deathly hush; then the Eldenoran captain lunges at him, grabs him by the neck, and lifts him one-handedly off his feet.</p>
<p>‘I’ve a better idea, y’bilge rat. Why don’t I shut your mouth up instead, eh?’ he growls, as slowly he tightens his vice-like grip on the helpless crewman’s throat.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to make the Eldenoran release his grip, <a href="sect173.htm">turn to 173</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose instead to apologize to the captain and ask him politely to release the crewman, <a href="sect103.htm">turn to 103</a>.</p>
