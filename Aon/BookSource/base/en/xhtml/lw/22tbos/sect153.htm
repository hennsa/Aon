<h3>153</h3>

<p>The celebrations go on throughout the night, but you are able to find a quiet place to sleep for a few hours before dawn breaks over this happy city. When you tell the people that you must leave and continue your journey south, they are saddened by the news. They want you to stay as their new chieftain, but you persuade them that they must choose a new leader from among their own tribe. Before you leave they provide you with a mule and some food (enough for up to 3 Meals).</p>
<p>By mule you expect the overland journey from Kitaezi to Caeno to take no more than three days. It is a rough, potholed trail and yet your mule never once misses his footing or causes you to fall. During the afternoon of the second day you enter the foothills of the Hulhuk Mountains and see a plume of black smoke rising into the sky. It comes from behind a treeless ridge, less than half a mile from the trail. The sound of anguished voices can be heard on the wind and these cries prompt you to leave the trail and investigate. As you crest the ridge you see a small native village. Several of the huts are on fire and its people are trying desperately to save their livestock and quell the raging flames.</p>
