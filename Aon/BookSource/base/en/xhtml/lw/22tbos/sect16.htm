<h3>16</h3>

<p>You climb the stairs to the foredeck and scan the horizon for signs of a pirate raider. Less than a mile away you can see a huge vessel with a purple mainsail sailing towards the strait. Captain Radyard appears at your side and he views the approaching craft through his telescope.</p>

<p>‘Weigh anchor!’ he orders. ‘Unfurl all canvas. I want every ounce of speed she’ll give us, lads.’ The captain’s urgent orders stir the crew into a frenzy of activity. As they set about their duties, you ask Radyard what is wrong. Without taking his eye from his telescope he says:</p>
<p>‘That’s Sesketera’s flagship—<cite>The Triasus</cite>. I’d recognize her sails anywhere. That scoundrel must want you badly to have sent the pride of his battle fleet after the likes of us.’</p>
<p>With all canvas lowered, the <cite>Seasprite</cite> cuts a rapid course through the glassy blue waters of Kastrow’s Door. Yet <cite>The Triasus</cite> has the advantage and relentlessly she closes the gap until no more than 30 yards of water separate her from the <cite>Seasprite</cite>’s starboard beam. The Siyenese cajole and curse and wave their fists at their pursuers, but their bravado soon crumbles when they find themselves staring into the muzzles of a double row of wide-bored naval cannon. A warning shot from a swivel gun whistles through the <cite>Seasprite</cite>’s rigging, and then you hear the voice of Sesketera himself.</p>
<p>‘Surrender the Northlander to me, captain,’ he shouts, through a loudhailer, ‘or I’ll have my gunners blow your ship out of the water!’</p>
<p>Radyard glances at you with fear in his eyes. He knows that he cannot outrun <cite>The Triasus</cite>, and he also knows that Sesketera is not a man who is given to making idle threats.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to volunteer to surrender to Sesketera in order to save Captain Radyard and his ship, <a href="sect113.htm">turn to 113</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide instead to abandon the <cite>Seasprite</cite> and attempt to swim for the shore, <a href="sect92.htm">turn to 92</a>.</p>
