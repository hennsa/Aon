<h3>180</h3>

<p>You enter the crowded emporium and marvel at the sheer variety of goods that are for sale—Lencian silverware, spices from Mhytan, animal hides from southern Karnali, to name but a few. There is even pottery and ironware from your homeland, all stacked side by side upon the shelves and counters that fill this busy store.</p>
<p>You make your way to a counter and ask a moon-faced youth in a leather apron if he knows the whereabouts of Radyard, the master of the <cite>Seasprite</cite>. He has never heard of the captain, but he is eager to help and he does not want to lose your custom. He invites you to look around the emporium while he goes and asks his employer.</p>
<p>You browse along the shelves and, although you find many of the items fascinating, there are only six that you would consider purchasing: a hammer, a coil of rope, a silver-backed mirror, a blanket, a steel flask, and a pewter goblet.</p>
<p>The youth returns shortly and you see him shaking his head. He is unable to help you find Radyard and his crew.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enquire about the prices of the items you have noticed, <a href="sect57.htm">turn to 57</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to purchase anything here, <a href="sect278.htm">turn to 278</a>.</p>
