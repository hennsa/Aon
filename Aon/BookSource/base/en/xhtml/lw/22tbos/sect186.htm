<h3>186</h3>

<p>Zinair has made preparations for your journey by boat to the Isle of Lorn. This fabled home of the Shianti lies 120 miles from the Port of Suhn, and has been protected for thousands of years from the attentions of man by enchantments, magical mists, and mage winds.</p>
<p>‘Only by virtue of your possession of the Moonstone can this voyage be undertaken with any hope of success,’ he says. ‘I have been in mind-contact with the Shianti, and they are ready to receive you.’</p>
<p>You sense that Zinair is proud of your successes and achievements during the quest so far, but you also sense that he is ill at ease and you ask him what is wrong.</p>
<p>‘The Moonstone will facilitate your passage through the Sea of Dreams to the Isle of Lorn, Grand Master. But you should know that this journey could still prove perilous. The Shianti no longer have control over the forces that exist within this enchanted region. Until you reach the shores of Lorn, your fate will be entirely in your own hands.’</p>
<p>It is a daunting message but you do not allow it to weaken your resolve. You stare Lord Zinair confidently in the eye as you reply: ‘It need be no other way, my lord. I am ready.’</p>
<p>Zinair smiles. ‘So be it, Grand Master. But now you must sleep, for you sail at dawn.’</p>
