<h3>210</h3>

<p>You force open the door to one of the houses and lead the crewmen inside, but sadly your attempt at evasion is short-lived. One of the owners of a neighbouring house informs the City Guard officer of where you are hiding and within minutes his men have forced their way in and overpowered you and your companions: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>You are dragged into the courtyard and guarded at spear-point until two horse-drawn wagons arrive to take you away to the city gaol. As you are herded aboard these foul-smelling carriages, your Weapons, Kai Weapon, and Backpack Items are confiscated and dumped into a wooden crate beside the driver’s seat. (On your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> mark each of these items with an asterisk [*] to indicate that they are no longer in your possession, but do not erase them at this time. Any Special Items you possess are allowed to remain with you.)</p>
<p>At the officer’s command the wagons move off at a speedy pace. After a few bruising minutes your wagon emerges from the gloomy streets and ascends a smooth ramp which passes through the daunting gate of Ghol-Tabras gaol. Above this gate flutters a flag which depicts a black serpent entwined around the blade of a silver scimitar. It is the personal emblem of Sesketera, the ruler of this city, a man not known either for his kindness or for his mercy.</p>
