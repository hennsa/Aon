<h3>213</h3>

<p>You tell the elder that you are on an important journey. You say that you are sorry you cannot help his village any further but you must leave at once. He follows as you return to your mule and he pleads with you to change your mind. When you refuse, you sense a strange transformation taking place. His face contorts with rage and your Kai senses detect an aura of evil that is chillingly familiar. It is identical to that which surrounded Ulonga the Shaman. Suddenly he snatches an amulet from a chain hanging around his neck and thrusts it at your mule. The air around it crackles and a bolt of energy leaps from his hand to strike the creature’s head, rendering it unconscious. The elder gives an evil laugh as he raises his hand and points the amulet at your face.</p>
