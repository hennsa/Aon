<h3>223</h3>

<p>You awake to the sight of brilliant sunshine pouring through the window of your room. Your head throbs painfully and there is a strange smell in the air that does not come from the communal lavatory next door. You recognize it to be the aroma of gallowbrush—a powerful soporific potion. The chair that you placed against the door is no longer there. Its absence makes you immediately check your equipment. As you fear, you discover that you have been drugged and robbed during the night. Your Belt Pouch is empty (erase all Gold Crowns and Nobles from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>) and you have lost one Special Item (erase one item of your choice, excluding the Moonstone).</p>
<p>You suspect the tavern-keeper to be the thief and you decide to confront him but, when you look out of the window, you see that the ferry is getting ready to depart. Quickly you grab your belongings, leap through the open window, and race along the waterfront.</p>
