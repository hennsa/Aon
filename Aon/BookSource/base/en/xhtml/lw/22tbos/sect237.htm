<h3>237</h3>

<p>When you decline his offer of food, the bald man shrieks with rage and begins to curse you in a language that you do not recognize. Even so, the mere sound of his vile curses is enough to send a shiver of dread coursing down your spine, like a trickle of icy-cold water. He denounces you to the others as an agent of the City Council sent to spy on their meeting, and he orders them to attack and slay you. The men react slowly to his frantic commands. It is as if they are struggling to awaken from a deep sleep. You have no wish to fight these men and so you turn and run towards the park entrance to escape from them. As you reach the open gate, you glance over your shoulder to see that the bald man is preparing to hurl a dagger at your back.</p>
