<h3>250</h3>

<p>Slowly the door opens to reveal a grey-haired man clad in the robes of a High Council Elder of Dessi. At first his sea-blue eyes and lordly countenance are fixed in seriousness, but then he recognizes the insignia of your Kai tunic and his stern face breaks into a warm and welcoming smile.</p>
<p>‘Praise the gods! You have arrived, Grand Master. I feared that you and your precious cargo had been lost at Ghol-Tabras. I am Zinair. Please, please, come inside.’</p>
<p>Lord Zinair ushers you into the consulate and asks you to wait in his private chambers. After he has taken the precaution of dismissing his staff, he joins you there. He had expected your arrival weeks ago and had almost abandoned hope that he would ever see you alive, fearing that you had fallen foul of Sesketera. When you recount all the perils of your journey from Elzian, Zinair is doubly amazed that you are with him now. You reassure him that you still have the Moonstone and you offer to show him the precious artefact, but he declines your offer saying that it would be safer for you both if it were to remain within its korlinium satchel.</p>
<p>Zinair suggests that you bathe and eat and avail yourself of the many luxuries that the consulate has to offer. He suggests that after you are rested you meet again later so that you may discuss the final and most vital part of your mission.</p>
