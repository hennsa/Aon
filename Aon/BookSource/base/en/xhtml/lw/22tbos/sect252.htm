<h3>252</h3>

<p>The Lucky Horse Inn is famous for its gaming tables which attract some of Magnamund’s most notorious gamblers. Even at this early hour of the afternoon its tables are busy as fortunes are wagered, won, and lost on the turn of a card or the roll of a die. Gregor buys you a tankard of ale and together you stand and watch an interesting game of 5-card Lourdenian Draw unfold at a nearby table.</p>
<p>After surviving the attack upon his ship, Gregor is feeling lucky. When two players drop out of the game he suggests the idea that you and he should take their places.</p>
<p class="choice">If you agree to his suggestion, you can join in the game by <a href="sect8.htm">turning to 8</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not wish to gamble, you can leave the inn and continue along the main street by <a href="sect168.htm">turning to 168</a>.</p>
