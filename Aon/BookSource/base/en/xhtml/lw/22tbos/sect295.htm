<h3>295</h3>

<p>You reach the ferry station as the vessel is leaving and you are forced to leap from the jetty and cling to its tailgate. The ferryman on the deck of the vessel grabs your hands and helps you to climb aboard. He then asks you to pay the fare of 2 Nobles and your heart sinks when you remember that all your money was stolen during the night. The ferryman becomes impatient; he threatens to have you thrown overboard if you do not stump up the fare. After some arguing he finally agrees to accept one Backpack Item in lieu of cash. (Delete from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> one Backpack Item of your own choosing.)</p>
<p>You settle yourself at the bow rail and look around at your fellow travellers. Most appear to be merchants with wagons and handcarts that are loaded with goods destined for the markets of Tiklu. It is a short voyage of 20 miles across the strait. As the ferry approaches the landing jetty, your fellow passengers get ready to leave. During the disembarkation, one merchant’s small cart is overturned and his cargo is spilled onto the shore. The other merchants push past him, but you feel sorry for his plight and you help to calm his carthorse and retrieve his goods. He is very grateful for your assistance and he offers you a ride to Tiklu aboard his cart which you willingly accept.</p>
