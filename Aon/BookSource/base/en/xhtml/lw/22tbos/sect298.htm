<h3>298</h3>

<p>You explain the problem to Melchar and he solves it by swiping a pair of lady’s pink pantaloons from a washing line that is strung across the alley. Their furious owner sees him stealing her gaudy garment from her bedroom window, and she hurls a chamber pot at him in a desperate attempt to stop him getting away. Unfortunately, the pot hits you on the back of the head (lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point). As you escape along the winding alleyway, you rub the bruise that is rising on your head and curse your luck. But you are grateful of one thing: at least the chamber pot was empty!</p>
<p>You follow Melchar through the alleyways of the east quarter which take you all the way back to The Song of the Silver Star tavern. The young journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having escaped from Wrok’s henchmen when finally you enter the sanctuary of the inn’s crowded taproom. The innkeeper asks Melchar if he bought his pantaloons with the proceeds of his winnings at the racetrack. He replies that, thanks to your advice, he did not bet. The only thing he lost was his breeches and he proceeds to tell the innkeeper how that came about. The man frowns.</p>
<p>‘Wrok’s not a man to cross, y’know,’ he warns. ‘He’s ruthless when it comes to getting even. I think you two had better stay in the attic tonight. Wrok’s sure to send his lackeys out a-huntin’ for you.’</p>
<p>You heed the innkeeper’s warning and spend the night hidden in his attic room. Before dawn breaks you slip out of the tavern by a back door and say farewell to Melchar in the street outside.</p>
<p>‘Captain Leonghi’s ship is moored down at the docks,’ he says. ‘It’s called <cite>Embassage</cite>. I wish you a swift and safe journey to Nhang, Grand Master. I’ll always remember our little adventure at the Caeno Derby and I hope we’ll meet again one day when you return home to Sommerlund.’</p>
