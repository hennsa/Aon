<h3>300</h3>

<p>You reach Caeno in the early evening. For all its great size and former splendour, this city has the appearance of a half-deserted ruin. The famous grand mansions of its northern quarter are now little more than dilapidated shells, and its paved avenues are broken and overgrown with weeds. Yet despite its state of neglect and decay, Caeno is a crowded city, especially at this time of the year.</p>
<p>You discover why as you make your way through its twisting, soot-blackened streets. On every other wall there hangs a gaudy yellow poster announcing the Caeno Derby, an annual race that attracts visitors from all over Magnamund. The race is to be run tomorrow and the inns and boarding houses are overflowing with customers. After a long search, you finally discover a shabby inn called The Song of the Silver Star that has a vacant room. The fat innkeeper informs you with glee that bed and board will cost you 6 Nobles, an exorbitant sum for such a run-down establishment.</p>
<p>‘It’s the derby,’ he says, without a hint of an apology. ‘Beds is at a premium with so many visitors around.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to pay the innkeeper 6 Nobles, <a href="sect259.htm">turn to 259</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="sect325.htm">turn to 325</a>.</p>
