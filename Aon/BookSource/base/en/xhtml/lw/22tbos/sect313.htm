<h3>313</h3>

<p>You speak the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Net</i> and point your right hand at the creature’s head. A sticky gout of liquid emerges from your fingertips and shoots towards the creature, yet it reacts with incredible swiftness and leaps aside in time to avoid being caught up in the gluey fluid.</p>
<p>Having evaded your attack it now continues to stalk its chosen target. Gemulkin frees himself from the wheel, but before he can get away, the beast is upon him like a hungry lion. It grabs him by the throat and lifts him off the deck. You race across the slippery decking and unsheathe your Kai Weapon to strike the creature in the side. Callously the beast hurls Gemulkin into the sea and then spins around to face you. Your first blow opens a wound across its chest, making it shriek loudly. But it recovers in an instant and it lashes out at you to connect with your shoulder. The force of the blow knocks you sideways and sends you sliding across the slick deck to fall headlong through an open cargo hatch.</p>
