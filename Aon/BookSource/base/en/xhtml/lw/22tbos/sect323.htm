<h3>323</h3>

<p>Beyond the taverna the road enters a dense timberland and makes a gradual ascent into the hills beyond. It is an uncomfortably hot and humid region, and you are made to feel even more uncomfortable by swarms of tiny insects that bite any exposed areas of your flesh (lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point). Judging by the number of bites you sustain, you suspect that these insects consider Sommlending flesh to be something of a delicacy.</p>
<p>As the sun approaches the horizon, the road passes across a high plateau before descending towards the shimmering green waters of the Jazer Strait. The city of Jazer nestles in a wooded bay and you arrive at its east gate shortly after sunset. A notice board fixed to the gatehouse wall informs you that you have missed the last ferry, a service which carries road travellers across the strait to connect with the trade road to Tiklu and beyond. The next ferry leaves tomorrow morning at an hour after dawn.</p>
<p>It is a warm night, and as you wander through the streets of this city, you contemplate where you should best spend it.</p>

<p class="choice">If you decide to sleep in the open, <a href="sect203.htm">turn to 203</a>.</p>
