<h3>327</h3>

<p>You halt and very slowly lift your hands away from your sides to demonstrate to the Eldenorans that you are not reaching for a weapon. Then you focus on the Eldenoran captain and launch a sharp pulse of psychic Kai energy at his head. He gasps, and then he lets the crewman fall to the taproom floor as the power of your psychic probe burns through his mind like a red-hot dagger.</p>
<p>Fearing that their captain is having some kind of fit, the drunken Eldenorans begin to panic. Some throw their ale into his face to revive him, while others struggle to lift his heavy body onto a cluttered table. When one man slices open the captain’s close-fitting leather jerkin with his dagger, so as to help him breathe, another thinks that he is attacking his master. He punches him unconscious and suddenly a fist-fight erupts. During the commotion, you indicate to the Suhnese that now would be a good time to leave. Without a word they rise from their tables and move towards the door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade as they make a hasty exit from the tavern. Once outside, the Suhnese can afford to laugh at the incredible stupidity of the Eldenorans. It is hollow laughter, but at least it helps them to relieve the frustration of having to return early to <cite>The Azan</cite>.</p>
