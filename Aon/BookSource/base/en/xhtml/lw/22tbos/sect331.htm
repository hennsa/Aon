<h3>331</h3>

<p>You leap over the bodies of the henchmen and follow Melchar as he leads you back through the streets of Caeno to The Song of the Silver Star tavern. When finally you enter the sanctuary of its crowded taproom, the young journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having escaped from the racetrack alive. The innkeeper asks Melchar if his happy mood is due to a win at the derby. He says that, thanks to your advice, he did not bet and therefore he did not lose. He also adds the real reason why he is feeling elated, and the innkeeper frowns.</p>
<p>‘Wrok’s not a man to cross,’ he warns. ‘He’s ruthless when it comes to getting even. I think you two had better stay in the attic tonight. Wrok’s sure to send his lackeys out a-huntin’ for you.’</p>
<p>You heed the innkeeper’s warning and spend the night hidden in his attic room. Before dawn breaks you slip out of the tavern by a back door and say farewell to Melchar in the street outside.</p>
<p>‘Captain Leonghi’s ship is moored down at the docks,’ he says. ‘It’s called <cite>Embassage</cite>. I wish you a swift and safe journey to Nhang, Grand Master. I’ll always remember our little adventure at the Caeno Derby and I hope we’ll meet again one day when you return to Sommerlund.’</p>
