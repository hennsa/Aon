<h3>333</h3>

<p>‘Perhaps you can tell me what you make of this, captain,’ you say, as you retrieve the Siyen Crown from your Backpack. ‘It was found some weeks ago in a wreck off the coast of Vassagonia.’</p>
<p>Radyard takes the silver crown and he inspects it carefully. He smiles when he discovers a Siyenese inscription engraved along its inner rim.</p>
<p>‘It’s the crown of a princess,’ he says. ‘Not a state crown, mark you, but one that she would have worn while carrying out her daily duties. The inscription shows that it comes from the royal household of Oridon. It’s more than a century old and I’d say it’s likely that it belonged to Princess Fahra. She was lost at sea. It’s not worth a great fortune but it would have some historical value, especially in my homeland.’</p>
<p>‘In that case, captain,’ you say, ‘you are welcome to keep it … in return for my passage to Masama.’</p>
<p>Radyard readily agrees (erase this Special Item from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>) and he refills your glass with ale and proposes a toast:</p>
<p>‘To the long and prosperous friendship of our countries—to Sommerlund and Siyen!’</p>
