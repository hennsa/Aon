<h3>339</h3>

<p>Fair weather returns and <cite>The Azan</cite> makes good speed as it crosses the jade-green waters of the Gulf of Tentarium. It is shortly before noon of the following day when the first glimpse of Zharloum is sighted by the lookout, and less than an hour later you find yourself sailing into the harbour of this grand city. Emerald pennants flutter from its towers and the roofs of its sun-bleached houses, and crowds of industrious citizens throng its paved avenues and alleyways. This old Shadakine port has a long history of free and fair trading. It is many miles from the cities of Shadakine political power which lie to the south, and due to this fortunate fact it has been spared much of the damage inflicted upon this troubled land by a succession of ruthless and tyrannical rulers.</p>
<p>The ship enters and docks at the harbour wall, close to the jetty of a warehouse which contains the iron and copper ingots that it will carry to Suhn. As the crew begin the task of loading the cargo aboard, you agree to help Gregor find the Lourdenian Consulate so that he may report the attack upon his ship, and seek their help in returning home.</p>
<p>Together you disembark from <cite>The Azan</cite> and follow a cobblestoned road which leads out of the harbour and into the heart of the city. When asked for directions, a helpful trader tells Gregor that the Lourdenian Consulate building lies at the far end of this busy main street. He gives the smiling man a Gold Crown and then you continue your way along this crowded thoroughfare. Gregor wishes to reach his Consulate but he is in no great hurry. He suggests that perhaps you and he could first pay a visit to one of the many colourful inns or famous emporia which line this teeming main street.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to visit the Zharloum Herb Emporium, <a href="sect61.htm">turn to 61</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would like to visit the Lucky Horse Inn, <a href="sect252.htm">turn to 252</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you prefer not to visit either of these famous establishments, you can continue along the main street by <a href="sect168.htm">turning to 168</a>.</p>
