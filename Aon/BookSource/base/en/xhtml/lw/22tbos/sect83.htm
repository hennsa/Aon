<h3>83</h3>

<p>The man curses you quietly under his breath and then he melts away into the taproom crowd. You leave the tavern and approach the Masama Warehouse. On entering this vast building you discover that it is filled with huge quantities of raw and basic commodities such as metals, grain, cloth, timber, and leather. As you inspect these basic materials you come across several crates of linen that are branded with a crown and star, the mark of Siyen. Your Kai senses tell you that it could be part of Radyard’s cargo.</p>
<p>The owner of the warehouse approaches and asks the nature of your business. He has an oily smile that you could find easy to dislike. You ask if he knows Captain Radyard and his slippery smile turns into a scowl.</p>
<p>‘I charge for information,’ he snaps. ‘Hand over 3 Nobles or be on your way.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to pay the man 3 Nobles (1 Noble = 1 Gold Crown), <a href="sect315.htm">turn to 315</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you refuse to pay him, <a href="sect217.htm">turn to 217</a>.</p>
