<h3>103</h3>

<p>The last Cavalian shudders as you land your killing blow. He shrieks his death-cry and twists away from your blade to fall limply across the heaped bodies of his confederates. As the echo of his plaintive cry fades, you hear another sound that makes you spin on your heel and face the stables door; it is the sound of running footsteps, and they are getting louder by the second. The sound of combat has alerted another group of Cavalians who were waiting inside the tavern. Now they are rushing across the courtyard towards the stables.</p>
<p>Karvas hides himself beside the door and he fells the first Cavalian to enter with a scything swipe to the midriff. As he doubles over and falls, another four come bursting through the doorway and throw themselves upon you, hacking and slicing with swords and axes. You make short work of these clumsy warriors. You dispatch three of their number while Karvas skilfully defeats the fourth. You are about to mount your horses and leave when another Cavalian suddenly appears, silhouetted in the doorway. He is attired from head to toe in crafted leather armour, and in his right hand he clasps a sword that radiates a sickly evil. Its razor-sharp blade is wreathed with green flame and a fiery red jewel pulsates at its hilt. With a cry of vengeance upon his lips, this fearsome warrior-mage launches a ferocious attack.</p>
