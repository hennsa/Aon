<h3>106</h3>

<p>As your final blow shatters the second blade and breaks the spell that brought it to life, you hear the sound of a bell tolling in a lower level of the citadel. Your Sixth Sense warns you that it is an alarm bell; your escape from the dungeons has been detected.</p>
<p>You leave the library and hurry across the sumptuous chamber to the shiny steel door by which you first entered this apartment. Soldiers are ascending the stairs towards it. You catch a glimpse of them and quickly you retreat into the chamber, slamming the door shut behind you. An attempt to secure the door is unsuccessful for the lock is jammed and the dial refuses to turn. Hastily you and Karvas barricade the door with furniture and then you look about for another way to escape. You see only one—through the window. The soldiers are pounding on the door and the barricade is shifting and collapsing as you and Karvas climb out onto a stone ledge. The barricade gives way and you hear the soldiers shouting as they force their way into the chamber. Then an arrow shatters against the surface of the ledge, only a few inches from your left boot. You look up and see Citadel Guardsmen with loaded bows leaning over the battlements above. Alerted by the tolling bell, they have spotted you on the ledge outside Sadanzo’s chamber. When a second arrow pierces Karvas’ cloak, you take hold of the Prince’s forearm and pull him with you as you step off the ledge and plummet towards the moat, 30 feet below.</p>
<p>You hit the stagnant water with a mighty splash and immediately strike out for the surface. You break through the scummy film that floats on top of the water and, seconds later, you see Karvas emerge from the depths to gasp a lungful of clean air. Arrows are falling all about you. They drop from the battlements above, and they streak past your head, fired by archers who are running across the drawbridge.</p>
