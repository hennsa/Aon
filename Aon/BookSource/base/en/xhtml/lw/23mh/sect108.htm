<h3>108</h3>

<p>As the last of Sadanzo’s knights crashes dead at your feet, you leap over his crumpled body and rush towards the rear of the stables where the slain knights’ horses are tethered to a rail. You and Karvas cut free the two sturdiest mounts and pull yourselves into their saddles. Prince Karvas wheels his horse about and rides him out into the courtyard. When you emerge from the stables, you are following close behind the Prince and struggling hard to keep your jittery horse from losing its footing on the smooth flagstones. Strewn around the walled yard and paddock are the bodies of slain and wounded troopers. Your heart goes out to these brave men, but you dare not stop to help them. To do so would be suicidal. Karvas gallops his horse towards the open gates and you hear shouts of alarm from the Cavalians positioned around the courtyard wall. They have recognized you and they are bringing their loaded crossbows to bear on your fleeing backs.</p>
