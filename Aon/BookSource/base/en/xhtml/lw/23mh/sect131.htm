<h3>131</h3>

<p>With care, Baron Lodamos’ men lift and carry Prince Karvas out of the chapel. You follow in the company of the Baron and his Marshal as they bear him along the corridors of the citadel and up a grand staircase to Lodamos’ personal chamber. Here they rest the Prince upon a divan and the Baron’s physician comes to examine him.</p>
<p>Lodamos offers you his sincere apologies for the harsh treatment you have endured since your arrival at his citadel. He explains that Sadanzo has made several attempts to murder him during the past year and he dare not lower his guard. The Baron is impressed that you survived your encounter in the chapel with the ghost of his ancestor—the paladin knight Ranald. ‘No mortal creature born of evil has ever survived the judgement of Ranald,’ he says, ‘and no goodly mortals have ever maintained their consciousness in his presence. I judge you to be no ordinary man. Pray tell, sir, who are you?’ You confide in the Baron that you are a Kai Grand Master and you tell him of your purpose here in Siyen. When you recount the events that have led you to his citadel, the Baron praises your courage and determination. You learn that he is a great admirer of the Kai and it is his ambition, one day, to journey to the monastery and meet with your illustrious leader, Lone Wolf.</p>
<p>Lodamos orders his Marshal to return your confiscated Weapons and equipment (you may erase the asterisks from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>). He also sends to the kitchens for food and wine. While the physician is attending to the Prince, you enjoy a reviving meal (you may restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
