<h3>132</h3>

<p>As the soldier approaches you suddenly realize that he is only aware of Prince Karvas. He has not seen you; the darkness and your innate Kai camouflage skills have kept you hidden from sight. Silently you sidestep into the shadows and unsheathe your Kai Weapon. Karvas stands immobile on the footpath and stares fixedly at the approaching guard so as not to betray your presence. Nervously the soldier reproaches the Prince and levels his spear at his chest. He commands Karvas to state the name of his commanding officer, and when he fails to reply, your Kai Sixth Sense suddenly warns you that this guard is about to raise the alarm.</p>
<p>With the speed and grace of a pouncing panther, you leap from the shadows and strike the guard on the side of the head with the hilt of your weapon. Without uttering a sound he crumples at the knees and falls unconscious on the path. Quickly you and Karvas drag his body away and hide it beneath the steps. Before you go, you make a quick search of the soldier’s pockets and backpack and discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 Ren (equivalent to 3 Gold Crowns)</li>
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>1 Meal</li>
</ul>
<p>You also discover an iron key that bears an inscription on its shank. Your Magnakai Pathsmanship skills enable you to decipher its meaning: ‘This key is the property of the Tehda Stables’.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep this Tehda Key, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry in the pocket of your tunic. You need not discard another item in its favour if you are already carrying the maximum number of Special Items permissible.)</p>
<p>Stealthily you climb the steps to a flagstoned loading area that is crowded with soldiers and wagons. By keeping low and moving from one wagon to the next, you and Karvas are able to cross this concourse undetected. On the far side you discover a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda. You hurry across it and enter a wide avenue which leads to the city’s east quarter. Grimy two-storey houses of carved hardwood pass by on either side, silent behind their bolts and shutters. At the end of the avenue you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You watch the ten-strong patrol as it marches past, and note that these men are clad in black quilted tunics with wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. They are almond-eyed and they all have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the river but, when they do, you see another patrol come marching along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden here in the timber yard and attempt to get a few hours’ sleep before dawn.</p>
