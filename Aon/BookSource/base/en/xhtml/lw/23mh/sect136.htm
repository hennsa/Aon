<h3>136</h3>

<p>You take the key from your tunic pocket and read the inscription on its shank: ‘This key is the property of the Tehda Stables’.</p>
<p>‘With luck this scrap of iron will net us two horses,’ you say, clasping it tightly. Karvas smiles and gets ready to move from behind the cart, but you tell him to stay here and wait for your signal. ‘Better I should go alone, my lord,’ you say. ‘It will halve the risk of being seen by the guards at the main gate. Wait here for my signal and be ready to act quickly when you see it.’ The Prince nods his agreement and he wishes you good luck before you go.</p>
<p>Aided by your Magnakai Discipline of Invisibility, you leave the cart and scurry across the square to the unguarded stables’ door. When you are sure that you have not been seen, you pull back the bolts and insert the key into the lock. With a prayer to Ishir on your lips that this is the correct key, you turn it in the keyhole. Your prayer is answered: the key unlocks the door. You push open the heavy portal and hurry through it into a courtyard beyond.</p>
