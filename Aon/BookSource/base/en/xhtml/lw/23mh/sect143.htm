<h3>143</h3>

<p>You are both still seated in the saddle at the end of your first pass. Quickly you bring your horse around to face your enemy and you steel yourself as you spur him forward once more. On the second pass you are wounded in your left calf (lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points), but your enemy is unhorsed. Your blow sends him crashing into the trees that border the trail. With the angry cries of his men echoing in your ears, you gallop back towards Karvas. In the distance you can see that the tree is burning less fiercely now and, as you approach the Prince, you call for him to follow as you race towards the flaming pine.</p>
<p>Bravely your horse makes a tremendous leap across the tree to land surefootedly on the trail beyond. As you bring him to a halt, you pat his neck in praise for his courageous action. Moments later, you see Karvas come leaping over the trunk and you cheer his masterful display of horsemanship. With a wave of your Kai Weapon you beckon him to follow as you make good your escape into the foothills of the Dammerdon Mountains.</p>
