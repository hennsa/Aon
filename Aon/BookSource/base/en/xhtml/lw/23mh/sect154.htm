<h3>154</h3>

<p>You are getting ready to cross the street to the building’s side door when suddenly the tower bell starts to toll. A few minutes later you see a long line of black-clad figures, mostly soldiers, come walking in single file towards the building. Two great doors swing open to receive this procession and you catch sight of the building’s cavernous interior. It is richly appointed with tapestries and golden ornaments, yet, despite its beautifully crafted opulence, you feel nothing but revulsion. Your Kai senses inform you that this place is a temple wholly devoted to the worship of an evil deity.</p>
<p>As soon as the procession has entered, the doors are slammed shut and the bell ceases to toll. Shaken but undeterred by what you have witnessed, you leave the warehouse and hurry across the street. The side door is unlocked and you open it and slip inside the small circular antechamber which lies beyond. Here you discover two further doors. You sense that one of them leads directly to the hall of the temple, for you can hear a dull chant arising from the congregation that has gathered there. The other door leads to the stairs of the bell-tower, but you quickly discover that this portal is securely locked.</p>
