<h3>157</h3>

<p>You rush across the road and run headlong into this crowded alleyway. It is packed with citizens who are hurrying towards the citadel to find out why the alarm bell is tolling. You push your way through them until you come to a junction where a wider passage crosses from left to right. A scream from the right draws your attention and you turn to see two lancers on horseback at the far end of the passage. They see you and they come riding along the narrow thoroughfare at an ever-increasing pace. Terrified Cavalians press themselves to the walls or scramble over gates to get out of their way as they charge along the passage with their lances levelled.</p>
<p>Karvas draws his sword and braces himself to meet their attack head-on. ‘I’ll take the one on the left!’ he shouts, defiantly. You look around you for a way to evade the charging lancers but every exit is now blocked by crowds of frightened citizens.</p>
