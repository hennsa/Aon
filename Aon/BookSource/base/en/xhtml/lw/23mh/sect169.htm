<h3>169</h3>

<p>You climb the steps to a landing on the level above where you hear loud voices and raucous laughter echoing from an archway. A glance through the arch reveals the chamber beyond to be a guards’ dormitory and mess hall. Over a dozen citadel guards and gaolers are gathered here, celebrating the capture of Prince Karvas with a cask of strong mead provided by the Knight Bachelor.</p>
<p>You continue up the circular stairs to the next level where you discover a hall that is lined with stands of armour and hung with tapestries. You remember being brought along this hall on the way to the dungeons, and you hurry through it to a pair of stout oak doors at its far end. To your disappointment you discover the doors are locked and bolted from the other side. At first there appears to be no other way out of the hall. Then your keen eyesight detects that one of the tapestries is moving slightly and, when you pull it aside, you discover a narrow archway and a flight of stairs leading up to a burnished iron door. As you climb towards the door, you see a small lever set into the centre of its shiny, smooth surface.</p>
