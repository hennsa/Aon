<h3>193</h3>

<p>You pay the farmer (erase the appropriate sum from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>) and he ferries you and your horse across the river. Then he goes back to collect Karvas and his mount. Once the Prince is safely across, you bid the cheerful farmer farewell and ride away from the river, heading east. You notice that Prince Karvas is smiling as he rides across this lush river valley and you ask him why this is so. He explains that the Ioma is the political boundary between the realms of Lunarlia and Siyen, and that you are now on Siyenese soil. After ten years in exile he has, at last, returned to his homeland.</p>
<p>Dusk is turning to darkness when you come to a road that crosses the valley to the east of Voshno. Your horses are tired and so you decide to camp for the night in a small wood that borders this road. Before you rest, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery).</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect125.htm">turn to 125</a>.</p>
