<h3>2</h3>

<p>You return to the jetty and show your tickets to the ticket seller. He grunts his approval and waves you aboard the riverboat. The number of your berth is written on your ticket, and you discover that you are both sharing cabin number 12 which is located at the stern. You are pleased to discover that it is one of the better cabins aboard. It has a cupboard stocked with food and wine, a washing bowl and a jug of water, and twin bunk beds with mattresses and feather pillows.</p>
<p>After a short while you hear the <i>clang</i> of the riverboat’s bell. It is a signal that the boat is about to set off for Seroa in five minutes’ time and a last call for passengers who are still in Xaia. Through the porthole of your cabin you can see the jetty and a queue of people boarding the boat. Fortunately, you do not see any Cavalians among them.</p>
<p>Once everyone is aboard, the gangplank is raised and the riverboat’s waterwheel begins to turn. As the boat gets underway, you lock the cabin door and settle down to a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect46.htm">turn to 46</a>.</p>
