<h3>211</h3>

<p>The final tumbler clicks into place and the door creaks open a few inches.<sup><a href="#sect211-1-foot" name="sect211-1">7</a></sup> The corridor outside the cell is unguarded, and you beckon Karvas to follow as you push the door wide and leave. As you step out, you see the door to the cell that contains your Weapons and equipment and you pause for a few moments to work on its tumbler lock. Your efforts are quickly rewarded and you discover all of your confiscated equipment lying here on the floor. (You may erase the asterisks [*] from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> to indicate that your arms and equipment have been restored.)</p>
<p>In addition to your equipment you also discover Prince Karvas’ sword and belt, together with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bow</li>
<li>6 Arrows</li>
<li>Enough food for 1 Meal</li>
<li>Spear</li>
<li>Axe</li>
</ul>
<p>Karvas buckles on his sword belt and, before you leave, he takes a coil of rope from a hook on the wall and slings it over his shoulder. On returning to the corridor, you hurry to the end to where a circular stone staircase ascends to the levels above. With your Kai Weapon in hand you begin to climb the steps, retracing the route that you committed to your memory when you were brought to the cell less than an hour ago.</p>
