<h3>227</h3>

<p>Early next morning, before dawn, you meet with Karvas and Sainus and go to collect your horses from the stable. As you mount them, the old man bids you good luck and he gives the Prince a pouch containing 50 Orla, a sum that could prove useful during the ride to Seroa.</p>
<p>Dawn breaks as you leave Sainus’ house, and you hear a bell which signifies that the night curfew has now come to an end. You ride along the streets of the north quarter and enter a broad avenue that leads directly to the east gatehouse. The guards posted here are opening the great east gate as you approach, and you gallop through the widening gap.</p>
<p>The sun shines brightly all day and you make good progress along the King’s Highway. By nightfall you have covered more than 80 miles and have reached a small village called Landsdorf. You decide to stop and rest at the village’s solitary tavern—the Golden Plough Inn—and as you ride into its courtyard a young stable boy runs to greet you and take care of your horses. Two rooms here cost 10 Orla, a sum which Prince Karvas pays in full using part of the money given to him by Sainus. The jovial tavern-keeper hands you each a key and he offers you a tankard of his best ale, on the house.</p>
<p>You accept his generous offer and enter the taproom of this hospitable tavern. As your frothing beer is being drawn from the cask, you overhear a conversation at a nearby table. Three farmers are discussing the crowning ceremony and one of them says that it is to take place at noon. This news unsettles Karvas, for traditionally the ceremony of ascendance begins at dusk, as soon as the sun disappears below the horizon. If what the farmer says is true, you now have only one and a half days left in which to reach Seroa in time for the crowning. You resolve to get as much sleep as you can this night, and then ride for Seroa at dawn. If you forgo sleep tomorrow and journey through the night, you can still arrive at the capital before noon on Harvestmas Day. Karvas prays that your horses are fit enough for the gruelling ride, and you are both glad that you have decided to rest them here tonight. They will need all their strength come the morning.</p>
<p>As you sip your ale, your rumbling stomach reminds you that you have not eaten for several hours.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to order and eat a meal in the taproom, <a href="sect142.htm">turn to 142</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to ignore your rumbling stomach and retire to your room as soon as you have finished your ale, <a href="sect41.htm">turn to 41</a>.</p>
