<h3>232</h3>

<p>Karvas takes a scroll, one of many that are crammed between the books that line the surrounding shelves, and places it inside the empty safe. Then he takes a tinderbox from his pocket and sets the scroll alight. You wait for a few minutes until all that remains of the scroll is a layer of flaky ash, and then he slams shut the door and spins its dial. Now, should Sadanzo open his safe, he will find that his contract with the Assassins’ Guild has mysteriously combusted.</p>
<p>Having completed the deception, you are both eager to leave this evil library without delay. But, as you are approaching the arch which leads to the adjoining chamber, you suddenly hear a noise which makes you stop dead in your tracks.</p>
