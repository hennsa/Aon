<h3>249</h3>

<p>You urge your horse towards the wooded hillock and enter the trees with just seconds to spare before the leading fanji come flashing past. You look about you but Karvas is nowhere to be seen. You fear he has been trampled by the stampede, but then he suddenly appears from out of the thundering wall of beasts. He is bruised and battered but he is still astride his horse and in full control of him. He veers his frightened steed away from the herd and comes galloping up the slope of the hillock towards the sanctuary of the trees. He pulls to a halt by your side and strokes the neck of his whinnying horse to reassure and calm him.</p>
<p>As the herd rush past the hillock, you glimpse more than a dozen horsemen who are galloping close behind them. They are hunters and they are picking off the best fanji at close quarters with bows and spears. Two of these fur-clad plainsmen see you and Karvas recovering among the trees, and instantly they steer their horses away from the herd and urge them towards the hillock. You sense that they suspect you and the Prince are after their quarry and, as they ride closer, they mouth curses and fire their bows at you.</p>
<p>Their steel-tipped shafts arc through the air and thud into the trees close by.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Bow and wish to return fire at these hunters, <a href="sect278.htm">turn to 278</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to attempt to evade them, <a href="sect133.htm">turn to 133</a>.</p>
