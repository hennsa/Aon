<h3>262</h3>

<p>Mentally you recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mind Charm</i> and attempt to use its power to command the Knight Bachelor to let you go on your way. As the waves of your psychic energy reach his mind, you are shocked to see that a green gemstone ring on the index finger of his right hand is beginning to radiate bright pulses of light. Your Sixth Sense warns you that this ring has the power to protect its wearer from the effects of charms and illusions. It also alerts him to the fact that you are attempting to use such magic on him.</p>
<p>The Knight Bachelor looks at the pulsating ring and then he glares at you. With a cry of rage he unsheathes his sword and attempts to strike out for your head, but you pull away and the point of the blade flashes past to gash your shoulder: lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>‘You sorcerous spy!’ he exclaims. You glance at Karvas and shout for him to follow your lead. The Prince nods in acknowledgement and you dig your heels into your horse’s flank, causing him to rear up and scrabble at the air with his forelegs. The Knight Bachelor pulls back on his reins and turns his steed aside to avoid being struck by the flailing hooves. At this moment, you press yourself flat against your horse’s neck and urge him forwards. The knight’s men bring their mounts together to block your escape, but your horse is quick to the gallop. He surges forwards and forces himself between two troopers, barging them from the saddle as he pushes through their stationary ranks. As you break from the circle, you hear Karvas cry out and the sound sends a shiver racing down your spine. When you glance back you see that he has been unsaddled and he is now lying on the ground, helpless before the stamping steel-shod hooves of the Knight Bachelor’s warhorse.</p>
<p>‘Surrender yourself, you trickster!’ commands the arrogant Cavalian knight. ‘Or your journeyman companion dies!’</p>
<p>Reluctantly you rein in your horse and raise your hands. Better to surrender and live to fight another day than permit Prince Karvas to be crushed beneath the hooves of this arrogant knight’s horse.</p>
