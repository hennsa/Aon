<h3>306</h3>

<p>The instant the cell door crashes shut, you use your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to loosen the cords that bind your wrists and then you untie the Prince. The air in this dark prison cell is dank and stifling. What little ventilation there is comes from the narrow crack that runs around the iron cell door. Your advanced Weaponmastery tells you that your Kai Weapon is close by, and when you close your eyes and concentrate, you detect it lying in an empty cell located directly opposite the door of the one you now occupy.</p>
<p>You vow to Karvas that this foul dungeon will not hold him for long, and you set about examining its walls and floor in the hope of finding a way to escape. However, you quickly discover that you have been locked in the securest cell of the citadel, deep below the ground. Beyond its slimy walls there lies nothing but solid earth. Only the cell door offers a glimmer of hope, yet it has no handle, hinges, or keyhole visible on the inside. It is not secured by a key but by a tumbler lock, similar to the lock of a safe, and it is opened by means of a dial on the outside of the door. Placing your ear to its surface, you use your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to will the lock tumblers to move. After a few moments you hear them begin to click over.</p>
<p>You discover the lock has three tumblers. To open the door, each tumbler has to be turned to the correct position in a sequence. Using your Sixth Sense, you determine that the first number in the sequence is equal to the number of horses you took from the Tehda Stables. The second is equivalent to the number of seeing stones that Lord Zinair gave to Wizard Acraban. The third in the sequence is equivalent to the number of additional Grand Master Disciplines acquired upon reaching the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior.</p>
<p class="puzzle">When you think you know the three-digit answer, note down the figures in order and <a href="numbered.htm">turn to the section of the book</a> which is the same as your answer.<sup><a href="#sect306-1-foot" name="sect306-1">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="choice">If you are unable to determine the correct solution, <a href="sect275.htm">turn instead to 275</a>.</p>
