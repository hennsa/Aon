<h3>308</h3>

<p>Wizard Acraban and Lord Zinair are already waiting aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> by the time you reach the market square. The magician orders the boarding cage to be lowered and you are winched up to the skyship. Both are anxious to hear your news of Prince Karvas’ whereabouts for their own enquiries have yielded little useful information. You inform them of what you have learned—that the Prince has a wife and they are living somewhere on the island’s northern coastline. Lord Zinair has discovered that Amarelda is the name of Karvas’ wife, and Acraban has learned that they last visited Mydnight a year ago.</p>
<p>‘You have done well, Grand Master,’ says Lord Zinair. ‘The citizens of this city are a secretive breed, yet you may have prised enough from them to help us find our reclusive Siyenese Prince.’ Turning to Acraban, he says: ‘I propose we travel north at first light and commence a search of the northern shoreline. It will be easier to espy his retreat from the air than to attempt a search by land.’</p>
<p>Acraban nods in agreement and passes word to his young crew to prepare the <cite>Starstrider</cite> for a voyage north at first light.</p>
