<h3>318</h3>

<p>‘Please forgive me, sir,’ you say, ‘but my companion and I are just simple journeymen from Sommerlund. We are not spies. Please, we did not mean to insult you with our silence. We are not familiar with your customs. In our land, it is not permitted for men of our lowly rank to speak to a Knight until he gives his permission. Please, kind sir, let us go on our way.’</p>
<p>Coolly the Knight Bachelor stares into your eyes. When he gets no reaction from you, he turns his head and fixes the Prince with the same cold, unblinking gaze. He knows nothing of Sommlending custom but he does know that the clothes you are wearing support your story. Yet he appears to be not entirely convinced. Your horses are Bhanarian steeds and he recognizes them to be so by the distinctive embellishments that adorn their bridles and saddles.</p>
<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense informs you that this Knight Bachelor is a greedy and ambitious young man who is hungry for promotion. He is thinking of arresting you and Prince Karvas on the charge that you are spies in order to impress his peers in Cavalia. You know that you must act swiftly if you are to avoid this.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to offer the Knight Bachelor a bribe in the hope that he will allow you and Karvas to go on your way, <a href="sect161.htm">turn to 161</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide not to attempt to bribe him, <a href="sect95.htm">turn instead to 95</a>.</p>
