<h3>52</h3>

<p>You enter the sleepy hamlet of Voshno and ride along its main street, past rows of dusty shops and gabled houses. You come to a market square. The villagers here are a sullen, silent crowd. Few pay you more than the scantest attention as they go about their evening chores. To the east of the square you can see a paved avenue called Shaney Street that leads down to the river. An arch of pale pink stone stands at the entrance to the Voshno Bridge, its surface pitted and scarred with lasting reminders of desperate battles fought here during wars past.</p>
<p>You recall the advice given you freely by the man called Daventi when you visited the Oridon Stone. He said that the bridge at Voshno has been seized by robber knights from Cavalia and they are demanding a heavy toll from anyone seeking to use it. You tell Karvas this and he says that you should avoid the bridge and continue north along the trail.</p>
<p>Three miles out of Voshno you see a small farmstead at the river’s edge. It has a water-mill and its wheel is turning slowly, grinding the farmer’s corn. Beside the mill you notice a raft moored to a wooden jetty. The farmer is in an adjoining field and he waves as you ride nearer. You stop to ask if he would kindly ferry you and your horses across to the other side of the river.</p>
<p>‘I’d be glad to, my lords,’ he replies, with a broad smile. ‘If’n you’d be willing to pay me 8 Lune.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to pay the farmer 8 Lune (or the equivalent—2 Gold Crowns), <a href="sect193.htm">turn to 193</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not have sufficient money to pay him, or if you choose not to accept his offer, <a href="sect32.htm">turn to 32</a>.</p>
