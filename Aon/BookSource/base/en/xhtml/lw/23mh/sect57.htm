<h3>57</h3>

<p>Your warning brings Acraban to an immediate halt, yet it comes just seconds too late for he has already stepped upon the edge of the covered pit. There is a loud <i>crack</i> of splintering wood and the young magician yelps with alarm as he drops feet-first through the branches which camouflage this trap.</p>
<p>Fearing the worst, you rush forward to help him. Suddenly he rises out of the pit before you, lifted up by a hastily-cast <i>Levitation</i> spell. His magical skill and swift reactions have saved him from being impaled upon the sharpened stakes which line the walls and base of this deadly trap. But he has not escaped the stakes unscathed: he has suffered deep gashes to his legs and feet.</p>
<p>Using your Kai healing skills, you tend to the magician’s wounds and restore him to health. The effort required to do this costs you 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. When he has fully recovered, you skirt carefully around the edge of this second trap before continuing on towards the clearing.</p>
