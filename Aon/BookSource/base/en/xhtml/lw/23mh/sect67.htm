<h3>67</h3>

<p>It has been a long time since Prince Karvas last visited Cavalia, but he is still able to remember the swiftest route from the citadel to the east gate. You ride fast and you are able to avoid the patrols of Citadel Guards that have been dispatched to hunt you down. You are anxious that your escape will be short-lived if the east gate is closed, yet fortune swings in your favour, for upon your arrival you discover a wagon has shed a wheel. Its broken axle is jammed in the threshold of the gate and a dozen guards are struggling to move it so that the portcullis can be lowered fully.</p>
<p>With an exuberant shout to the incredulous guards, Prince Karvas presses his head to his horse’s neck and gallops under the spikes of the portcullis. You copy the Prince’s actions and follow closely in his wake as he rides out of Cavalia along the straight road that heads due east to Varedo.</p>
<p>For more than an hour you ride without stopping until your horses refuse to take another step. They are young and lack the muscle and stamina of your Bhanarian steeds, yet they are healthy colts and will serve you better than most. After they have recovered, you press on across the plain until dusk. With darkness closing, you leave the road and take shelter for the night in a small wood. During your overnight stop, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery).</p>
