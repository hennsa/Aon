<h3>70</h3>

<p>Lodamos sends an urgent order to the commander of the cavalry, Guard Captain Sneida, to muster a troop of his best men and horses and have them ready to ride within the hour.</p>
<p>‘Sneida is a most accomplished horseman, and he knows the road to Seroa better than any man in this city or province,’ says Lodamos. ‘He and his troop will act as your escort to ensure that nothing delays your journey to the capital.’</p>
<p>The sleeping citadel of Varedo comes alive as preparations are made for your speedy departure. Lodamos takes you and Karvas to the stables where you are given the pick of his personal steeds. Karvas chooses a young black stallion and you settle for a dark bay mare. Lodamos approves of your choice: these horses possess speed and stamina, qualities that may prove essential if you are to reach Seroa in time. As your mounts are being saddled, you meet with Guard Captain Sneida and the men of your escort. You are impressed by their eager readiness to carry out this unexpected duty, and by the quiet professionalism with which they go about their preparations.</p>
<p>Baron Lodamos wishes you godspeed and bids you farewell as you climb into the saddle and get ready to set off from the citadel. It is still dark when you and your escort ride out of Varedo and head east across the plain, along a wagon-worn road that leads to Oberra. When darkness gives way to the golden light of the rising sun, the troop unfurls Lodamos’ personal banner which they carry proudly at the head of their column. It is a pale blue flag, trimmed with gold braids, and it depicts an owl clutching the blade of a sword. Karvas tell you that these symbols represent Lodamos’ motto—<cite>Wisdom and Strength</cite>. His flag serves you well, for as the day unfolds, all the fellow travellers you encounter on the road hurriedly move aside to allow you to pass unhindered when they see Lodamos’ banner approaching.</p>
<p>You ride all day and put more than a hundred miles behind you. It is dusk when Sneida brings the troop to the fortified chateau of Lord Jopas, Baron Lodamos’ younger brother. You stay there overnight, and in the morning the troop are furnished with fresh mounts for the coming day’s ride across the Lucien Hills. This region of Siyen is one of great natural beauty and you enjoy the panoply of castles, chateaux, and richly wooded valleys which unfolds as you traverse the hill trail to Oberra. When night falls you find yourselves still within the boundaries of this hilly timberland. Captain Sneida is loath to make camp in the forest for it harbours packs of wild wolves that may be tempted to attack by the scent of the horses. He urges the troop to continue for several moonlit miles further until you reach the chateau of Baron Jayde. He is commander of the Lucien Province and a trusted friend of Baron Lodamos.</p>
<p>The troop ride through a pair of open, torchlit gates and come to a halt inside a walled courtyard at the front of Baron Jayde’s grand estate. Adjacent to the gates are a stables block and a paddock. Captain Sneida orders his men to put the horses in the paddock while he goes to inform Baron Jayde of your arrival. You are leading your horses into the paddock by the reins when your Kai Sixth Sense warns you of hidden danger. You look around the courtyard and suddenly you realize that something is amiss. Ever since you arrived at the chateau you have seen no sign of Baron Jayde’s staff or guards. The estate is seemingly deserted. Then you hear Captain Sneida call out a welcome, and when you look to the chateau, you see the figure of a stout man standing in a doorway at the head of a grand flight of stone steps. ‘Well met, Baron Jayde,’ calls Sneida, but his friendly greeting elicits no response. The man in the doorway is utterly immobile; not a flicker of emotion stirs his pale round face. Sneida approaches and quickens his pace. He is halfway up the steps when suddenly the rotund figure of Baron Jayde topples stiffly forwards and falls, face down, upon the flagstones. Fear chills your blood when you see the polished handle of a stiletto dagger protruding from between his shoulder blades.</p>
<p>In that instant the trap is sprung. Suddenly the top of the courtyard is ringed by grim-faced soldiers armed with crossbows. ‘Ambush!’ shouts Captain Sneida. It is the last word he will ever utter. In response to his shout of warning, the soldiers let loose a deadly volley of bolts that claim his life, and the lives of four of his men. As the dead and wounded scream and fall, you drag Prince Karvas to the ground in a desperate effort to save him from being hit.</p>
