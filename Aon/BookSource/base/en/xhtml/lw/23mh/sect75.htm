<h3>75</h3>

<p>The second tumbler clicks into position and the door of the safe swings open<sup><a href="#sect75-1-foot" name="sect75-1">4</a></sup> to reveal a single scroll of vellum, embossed with a ribbon and a wax imprint of Sadanzo’s seal. You unfurl the scroll and you are shocked to the core when you read its contents.</p>
<p>The scroll is a contract between Baron Sadanzo and the Assassins’ Guild of Avalar. It states that the Guild will undertake the murder of King Oridon in return for 20,000 Orla. Half of this sum is to be paid in advance, with the balance due for payment upon successful completion of the assassination. The seal of the Assassins’ Guild is attached beside Sadanzo’s mark to show that the full sum has since been received.</p>
<p>You show the scroll to Karvas and he is outraged; here is proof beyond doubt that Sadanzo was responsible for the murder of his father, and clearly his act of foul treachery was part of his plan to seize the throne of Siyen. This shocking revelation fills Karvas with a renewed loathing for the Baron. He reaffirms his pledge to thwart Sadanzo’s scheme and he vows, in memory of his father, that he will bring the traitor to justice.</p>
<p>You take Sadanzo’s Scroll and place it inside your tunic. Record this on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item—you need not discard another item in its favour if you already possess the maximum number permissible.</p>
