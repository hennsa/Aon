<h3>81</h3>

<p>Quickly you retrieve your Flute from your Backpack and play a sequence of ultrasonic notes to counter the psychic assault that is battering you and Karvas. The effect is immediate and dramatic. The Prince revives and is able to pull himself upright on his horse. The Inquisitor-major and his fellow hunters, however, do not fare so well. They are immune to the sound of their own horn, but you use your Kai skill to turn the tables on them. Your notes occur at a higher frequency, one to which they are not immune. You watch with grim satisfaction as they wheel their horses about and gallop away in a desperate effort to put distance between themselves and the piercing sound of your Flute, which is filling their heads with an agonizing clamour.</p>
