<h3>95</h3>

<p>The Knight Bachelor glares at you. He attempts to say something but he cannot seem to muster his words. Red-faced, he unsheathes his sword and levels it at you in his trembling hand. ‘You … you are spies!’ he exclaims. ‘Throw down your weapons. By the power of my rank and … and for the security of Cavalia, I am arresting you both.’</p>
<p>The surrounding troopers draw their sabres and begin to edge their horses towards you, closing the circle. You see Karvas inching his hand towards his sword but you dissuade him from drawing it with a terse shake of your head. Better to surrender and live to fight another day than be slaughtered by such an overwhelming number of trained and disciplined soldiers.</p>
