<h3>98</h3>

<p>‘With respect, Grand Master, I’ve more experience of sky-sailing than you,’ retorts Acraban, ‘and my experience tells me that it is better to avoid rogue storm clouds, such as this one, by cutting below them rather than—’</p>
<p>Acraban’s words are suddenly drowned out by a crackling explosion that stuns you with its raw ferocity. From his nest atop the mainmast, the lookout shouts out a warning and frantically he points towards the ground. You rush to the rail and peer over the side, your stomach churning with fearful anticipation of what you will see. Deep within the fathomless reaches of the fissures and chasms passing below, you glimpse flashes of blue-white energy. These bolts are growing brighter and louder as they streak towards the surface. One bolt escapes from a vent in the middle distance and rips open the sky. It skewers a cluster of steam clouds and blows them apart in a spectacular explosion of gas and flame. Once again you urge Acraban to order his helmsman to ascend, this time to avoid the new and deadly danger that is striking from below.</p>
