<h3>104</h3>

<p>As you are filing out with the others through the south doors, you are challenged by an Eldenoran cavalry captain who grabs your shoulder and spins you around to face him.</p>
<p>‘By whose authority are you here, trooper?’ he demands. You show him your wristband, but this does little to allay his suspicions. Suddenly he grabs the hilt of your Kai Weapon and he tugs it from its scabbard. ‘This is not an Eldenoran sabre,’ he says, inspecting the blade. ‘Why is it in your possession? Did you loot it?’ Other commanders, drawn by the accusing tone of his voice, begin to take an unwelcome interest in you and quickly you find yourself surrounded on all sides by stern-faced officers. One of them steps forward and he points at your weapon. ‘By Naar!’ he exclaims. ‘That’s a Kai blade!’</p>
<p>Suddenly you are grabbed from behind and dragged to the ground. You struggle to break free, but you are quickly overwhelmed by the weight of numbers ranged against you. Guards are summoned and you are held securely until they arrive.</p>
