<h3>107</h3>

<p>The sergeant narrows his eyes and his knuckles whiten as he tightens his grip on his spear. You sense that he does not believe your story and he is suspicious of your true purpose here.</p>
<p>‘There’re no reinforcements due for two days,’ he growls. ‘You’d better show me your orders, trooper, or I’ll take you for a deserter.’</p>
<p>The sergeant glances over his shoulder to his two companions seated at the fire. They have been listening to your conversation and immediately they get to their feet and come running towards you with their spears at the ready. Calmly you reach into the pocket of your tunic, as if you are obeying the sergeant’s request, but then you kick your horse’s flanks and flick his reins. As he surges away, the sergeant and his men lunge at you with their steel-tipped spears.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 1 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 4 or lower, <a href="sect333.htm">turn to 333</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5 or higher, <a href="sect220.htm">turn to 220</a>.</p>
