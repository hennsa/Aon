<h3>110</h3>

<p>Rouf is hugged by his uncle and aunt who are overcome with emotion to see their favourite nephew once more. They thank you both for freeing them and they curse the Eldenorans who invaded their home. When Rouf tells his kin that you are a Kai Lord on a secret mission, their eyes widen with awe. Prizo warns you that there are many Eldenorans in this area and that it is no longer a safe place. He invites you both to stay here this night but he says you must remain watchful. Reluctantly Prizo and his wife have decided to leave their home. They plan to cross the Quarl and seek shelter in Salony. Many Slovian refugees, including other members of Rouf’s family, have found sanctuary there in the Great Forest.</p>
<p>You and Rouf take turns to keep watch during the night, and shortly before dawn you awaken his uncle and aunt. Fie prepares a delicious breakfast and while you are eating they discuss their plans. Rouf has decided to join his aunt and uncle and go with them to Salony. You tell them that you must continue with your mission and try to cross the River Storn near Tekaro. Prizo repeats Rouf’s warning that the city is occupied by the Eldenorans, but he also has some information that could be useful. He says that the Eldenorans have set up a military ferry on the Storn, five miles south of the confluence where the two rivers, the Quarl and the Storn, meet. In your disguise as an Eldenoran scout, you may find it the easiest way to cross the river.</p>
<p>After breakfast, you thank Rouf and his kin for their help and you wish them luck on their journey to Salony. In return they thank you for freeing them and Fie offers you some food for the road ahead (enough for 2 Meals). Then they bid you farewell and wave goodbye from the doorway as you leave the cabin and go to retrieve your horse.</p>
