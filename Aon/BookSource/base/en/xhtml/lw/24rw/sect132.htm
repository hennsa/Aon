<h3>132</h3>

<p>Your killing blow sends the Ogron tumbling down the ramp towards the onrushing guardsmen. They sidestep his body, and two of them let loose a parting arrow at your back as you disappear through the open gate which leads to Cillan Square, the paved thoroughfare surrounding the stronghold of Skull-Tor.</p>
<p>The worst of the storm has abated and the night sky is cloudless and clear, yet this does little to assist your escape from Vandyan’s dreaded fortress. The moon is full and the surrounding streets and houses are illuminated by its ashen rays. On reaching the square, you immediately turn to the north in the hope of finding a way to get back to the cooperage in Flank Street. The square is littered with the bodies of Vorka, and many Eldenoran citizens have left their beds to examine this disturbing spectacle. They huddle in groups on street corners and speculate in hushed tones about the likely demise of their leader.</p>
<p>You are hurrying along the northern flank of Cillan Square when suddenly you hear a sound that puts ice in your veins.</p>
