<h3>145</h3>

<p>You scramble through the trapdoor and slide down the rope to the hall below. You have barely touched the floor when a snarling guardsman rushes forwards and swings his battle-axe at your legs. Instinctively you leap high and avoid his clumsy blow and, at the height of your jump, you lash out with your foot and catch the Eldenoran squarely under the chin. The force of your kick lifts him off his feet and leaves him sprawled unconscious on the floor.</p>
<p>Arrows zip past and one rips the cuff of your tunic. Before the archers can reload and fire again, you rush to the edge of the pit and leap over the rail. Your fall is broken by the body of a Vorka and you are able to rise quickly to your feet. As you race across the debris-strewn pit towards the archway in the far wall, you hear Vandyan screaming maniacally at his guards. Arrows whistle down and some pass dangerously close as you duck and weave your way towards the distant arch.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Assimilance, add 3 to the number you have picked. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 2.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 3 or lower, <a href="sect118.htm">turn to 118</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4–6, <a href="sect15.htm">turn to 15</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 7 or higher, <a href="sect322.htm">turn to 322</a>.</p>
