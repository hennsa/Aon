<h3>156</h3>

<p>‘Ishir be praised! My prayers have been heard!’ yells the Slovian prisoner gleefully when his captors are felled by your deadly blows. As you step over their bodies and approach him, he leans forward in his saddle and holds out his hands, inviting you to cut through the rope that is wound tightly around his wrists.</p>
<p>‘My eternal thanks, sire,’ he says, as you sever his bonds. He then jumps down from his horse and offers his hand in friendship. ‘My name’s Rouf,’ he says, and a wide smile cracks his dark, travel-grimy features. ‘Those Eldenoran curs captured me on the plain east o’ Tekaro two days past. I was left behind to spy on their movements when my regiment pulled back to Suentina. Seems we may have somethin’ in common, you and I. We’re both operatin’ behind enemy lines, eh?’</p>

<p>The jovial Slovian helps you to hide the dead Eldenorans in the dense undergrowth. During this task he asks if you are a mercenary from Casiorn. When you tell him that you are a Kai, his jaw drops open with amazement. ‘A Kai Lord … here in Slovia! Ishir be praised. Perhaps we shall win this war after all.’ You confide in Rouf that you are on a secret mission and that you must reach the River Storn near Tekaro as soon as you can. He offers to help but he warns you that the city of Tekaro has fallen to the Eldenorans. They occupy the city and have thousands of their Vorka encamped outside its walls. From Tekaro they have been sending reinforcements to their armies fighting across the Slovarian Plain and along the River Suen. This whole region is alive with enemy patrols and it will be difficult for you to avoid them on your way to the Storn. Rouf suggests that you wear one of the dead Eldenoran’s uniforms, and that he accompany you on the road to Tekaro, posing as your prisoner. His uncle lives in the forest near the River Quarl, a day’s ride from here, and that is where he wants to go now that he is free.</p>
<p>You agree to his plan and swap your Kai journeyman clothes for the uniform of a dead Eldenoran scout. (You stow your own kit in your Backpack, which requires space equal to two normal items. If your Backpack is full, you must discard two items to create sufficient space for your Kai Clothes.) Having changed uniform, you mount one of the Eldenoran horses and ride with Rouf back along the forest track heading south towards Tekaro.</p>
