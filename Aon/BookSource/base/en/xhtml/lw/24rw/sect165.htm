<h3>165</h3>

<p>You give voice to a low, dull, repetitive chant which you project along the corridor towards the gaoler. At first he does not seem to react to your soporific dirge, but then you notice that he is starting to yawn repeatedly. After a few minutes, he sits down on the steps and cradles his head in his folded arms. You continue your hypnotic chant for a few minutes longer and then, when you are sure that it has had the desired effect, you leave your hiding place and move silently along the corridor. The gaoler is snoring softly when you reach him and you sense that he has fallen into a deep sleep. As you start up the stairs towards the next level, you notice a bunch of keys hanging from a hook attached to his leather belt. (If you wish to take these Dungeon Keys, record them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep in the pocket of your tunic.)</p>
