<h3>174</h3>

<p>The sound of your struggle alerts the other Vorka and they come rushing through the trees to investigate. Hastily you retreat into the woodland. You use your Magnakai Pathsmanship skills to cover your tracks as you circle around the Vorka and return to the river bank. The creatures have searched your sailboat and taken your provisions, but they have not damaged the craft nor left any guards. You slip into the boat and use an oar to push yourself away from the muddy bank. As the boat glides out towards the middle of the river where the current is strongest, suddenly you hear a cry go up from the stone bridge. The Eldenorans have seen you and they are hurriedly reloading their bows as your boat drifts nearer.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Assimilance<sup><a href="#sect174-1-foot" name="sect174-1">8</a></sup> and have attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior or higher, <a href="sect321.htm">turn to 321</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Elementalism and wish to use it, <a href="sect201.htm">turn to 201</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess neither of these skills, or if you have yet to attain the necessary level of Kai Mastery, you can fix both of your boat’s oars and row with the current to increase your speed as you approach the bridge by <a href="sect117.htm">turning to 117</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">Or you can abandon your boat and attempt to swim past the bridge while remaining under the surface by <a href="sect185.htm">turning to 185</a>.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect174-1-foot" href="#sect174-1">8</a>] You can only reach this section by <em>not</em> possessing Assimilance (cf. <a href="sect149.htm">Section 149</a>), so the option to use that Discipline here is superfluous.</p></div>
