<h3>226</h3>

<p>Delissa has already prepared the route by which you can escape from Duadon. One of the ancient tunnels of Skull-Tor passes directly below the city’s North Gate and it emerges in the middle of a coppice less than a mile from the city wall. She and Hulsta found a way to enter this tunnel through the cellar of a warehouse located less than half a mile from the cooperage. Hulsta scouted the tunnel before you arrived in the city, but Delissa is anxious to ensure that the way is still clear now that Vandyan’s troops are out hunting for you.</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn, she leaves the cooperage to scout the surrounding streets. When she returns an hour later, you sense that she is anxious and disappointed.</p>
<p>‘Vandyan’s men have discovered the tunnel,’ she says, despondently. ‘They have sealed it off and posted guards around the building. The watch on the battlements and at the city gates has been trebled, and a reward has been placed on your head.’ She takes a scroll from her pocket and gives it to you. When you unfurl it you see your own face depicted upon the parchment. Below is printed the sum of 10,000 Gold Crowns, and the words: ‘For delivery of this man’s body to Skull-Tor. Dead or Alive’.</p>
<p>‘They are posted on every street corner,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘It is not safe for you to leave the cooperage—everyone is looking for you. Duadon is awash with rumour. The Vorka have perished and the Eldenoran army is in retreat. The citizens fear retribution at the hands of those who were overrun by Vandyan’s horde, and as for Vandyan himself, they say he has gone mad with rage. He has ordered his most feared troops—the Sinistrari—to return to Duadon at once to lead the hunt for you. They are riding from Luyen and will arrive tomorrow.’</p>
<p>Delissa insists that you remain hidden in the parlour over the next two days. She hopes that Vandyan may begin to believe that you fled Duadon immediately after your escape from Skull-Tor, and that you are no longer to be found in the city. Her reasoning seems to be borne out by a reduction in the number of guards she sees patrolling the streets at the end of the second day. But when the third day arrives, you can no longer afford to lie low and wait for Vandyan to release his iron grip upon this city. You must reach Xaitar’s Rock before nightfall in order to rendezvous with Guildmaster Banedon.</p>
<p>Now that the tunnel can no longer be used, you formulate a new plan to escape from Duadon by way of the city’s North Gate. Delissa prepares a disguise for you, using theatrical make-up and a wig, and she also creates a convincing story to explain your departure from the city. You are to play the role of her cousin, and the two of you will be leaving Duadon bound for Luyen in order to tend to Delissa’s sister who has suddenly been taken ill. It is a bold plan, and as the hour of your departure draws closer, you offer up a prayer to Goddess Ishir in the hope that she will grant it her blessing. (Having rested for three days, you may now restore 9 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your current total.)</p>
