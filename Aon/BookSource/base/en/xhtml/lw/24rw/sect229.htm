<h3>229</h3>

<p>You surrender to the guardsmen and their leader, a thin-lipped man with jet-black eyes, orders his men to take you away. You offer no resistance as the guards march you off under close escort to their fortified guardroom.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter this daunting military prison, all of your Weapons and equipment are confiscated. Then you are thrown unceremoniously into an empty cell and its iron door is bolted shut. Immediately you set about searching for a way to escape from the cell, but it is only a matter of minutes before the door is thrown open and in rush a dozen guards clad in full battle-armour. They grab you before you can resist them and they pin you to the wall. Seconds later, a Guard Captain strides into the cell carrying your Kai Weapon. Raising it above his head, he steps forward and accuses you of being an enemy spy. You protest that you are innocent, that there has been a terrible mistake, but your desperate pleas fall upon deaf ears. With swift and deadly precision, the Guard Captain strikes you a mighty blow to the head, slaying you instantly with your own blade.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your mission end here in the guardroom of Skull-Tor.</p>
