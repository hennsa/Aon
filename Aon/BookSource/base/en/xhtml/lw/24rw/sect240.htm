<h3>240</h3>

<p>As you strike the telling blow, Zorkaan emits a hideous shriek. The shadowy creature begins to shimmer and whirl like a raging cyclone, rising and fading in intensity. Then, with a last mournful wail, it shoots upwards and disappears through the aperture in the hall’s domed ceiling, into the very eye of the storm that rages overhead. You raise your Kai Weapon once more and run towards the rune that hangs suspended in the air, above the shattered remains of the crystal bell-chamber. With cat-like grace you spring into the air and strike the black stone a single devastating blow. There is a loud explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts when your blade cleaves the evil stone in two.</p>
<p>Vandyan is shocked to witness the defeat of Zorkaan and the destruction of his Vorka horde. But the storm is reaching its peak above Skull-Tor, and soon he will summon the Vaag to enact his revenge upon you. He cackles with mad glee as he raises into position the crystal saucer which contains the last remaining rune. Bolts of lightning are striking at the very edge of the aperture now; it is only a matter of minutes before the Vaag will be released. Desperate to prevent this calamity, you rush across the hall to an iron ladder that is bolted to the obsidian wall. It ascends to the edge of Vandyan’s raised platform. As you climb towards the storm-lit platform, you pray to Kai to give you strength enough to defeat this wicked foe.</p>
