<h3>245</h3>

<p>A sudden gust of wind sweeps along the tunnel. It stirs the dust and catches the hem of your tunic jacket, making it waver slightly. Unfortunately, this tiny movement is noticed by the dog. It looks up and yelps with surprise when it sees you hiding in the fissure, and then it backs away and emits a frantic howl of alarm. The Eldenorans react swiftly to their dog’s warning cry. The two who remained in the chamber grab their swords and rush out to confront you, and their confederate comes running back along the tunnel.</p>
<p>‘A scout!’ he gasps. ‘Don’t let him get away!’ His sneering companions fix you with murderous stares and slowly they advance with their swords held ready to strike. Clearly they believe you to be an army scout sent to track them down. ‘Take ’im, boys,’ shouts the running Eldenoran. ‘If he gets out o’ here, he’ll go tell the reeves where we are.’</p>
<p>Sandwiched between them in the confines of the mine shaft, you have no option but to unsheathe your Kai Weapon and get ready to defend yourself from their attack.</p>
<p class="combat">3 Eldenoran Deserters: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 37   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 32</p>
<p>If you possess either ‘Illuminatus’ or ‘Kaistar’, you will benefit from the additional combat bonus applicable to their unique properties.</p>
