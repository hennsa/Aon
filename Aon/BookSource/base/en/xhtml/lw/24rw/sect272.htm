<h3>272</h3>

<p>You awaken shortly before daybreak to the bracing chill of a frosty morning. A pale half-light illuminates the river and surrounding landscape, and you cast your keen eye across it in search of enemy soldiers. Save for distant Tekaro and the Vorka horde encamped around its walls, you see no immediate threat and so you mount your horse and rejoin the highway heading south. After little more than two miles, you come to a wide cinder track that has been newly-laid by Eldenoran engineers to service a military ferry across the great river. You recall Rouf’s uncle telling you about this ferry and you decide to take a closer look. You steer your horse onto the track and follow it to a large raft which is moored at the river’s edge. There are six Eldenoran guards on duty here, but none pay you too much attention. They all seem to be nursing hangovers this morning and none feel inclined to speak. You ride onto the raft and remain in the saddle as the flat-bottomed ferry is winched by rope and pulley across the Storn. As soon as it comes to a halt, you ride your horse up a wooden ramp and onto a road that has been cleared and levelled by the Eldenoran army through this part of the Grochod Forest. When you are beyond sight of the ferry, you leave this military road and enter the trees. The timberland is too dense for you to make progress on horseback, so you abandon your mount and continue on foot.</p>
