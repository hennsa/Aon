<h3>275</h3>

<p>The rumble of thunder fails to divert the archers’ attention.<sup><a href="#sect275-1-foot" name="sect275-1">10</a></sup> As you draw closer, they let fly a deadly volley of arrows that puncture the boat’s timbers in many places. One shaft pierces your calf and you have to bite your fist to stop yourself from crying out in pain: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Water gushes in where part of the bottom has been holed by arrows. The Eldenorans cheer as your craft begins to founder, and as it disappears from view beneath the central arch, you hear their echoing footfalls as they rush across to the opposite side of the bridge to wait for it to reappear. Quickly you draw upon your healing skills to staunch the flow of blood from your wounded leg and, as the boat emerges, the Eldenorans give another cheer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must soon abandon the boat. You turn the rudder towards the left bank and aim your sinking craft at a place where a copse of willow trees overhang the river. As you pass beneath their branches, you clamber out and quickly take cover among the trees.</p>
<p>The Eldenorans soon arrive to inspect their handiwork. Silently you observe them as they drag the half-submerged boat out of the water and sift through its meagre contents. They soon tire of this and return to their duties at the bridge. When the coast is clear, you leave the copse and hurry away. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans, you stop to rest for a few hours in the bough of an oak tree.</p>
<p>Before you sleep, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>

<p>[<a name="sect275-1-foot" href="#sect275-1">10</a>] Due to game design issues, it is impossible to reach this section of the book (cf. <a href="sect174.htm">Section 174</a>). It is an oversight which is not easily correctable.</p></div>
