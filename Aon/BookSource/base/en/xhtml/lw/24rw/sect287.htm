<h3>287</h3>

<p>You enter the rear yard of the cooperage and climb the stairs to the parlour above the workshop. Delissa hears your approaching footsteps and she opens the door as you reach it. Having heard only one set of footfalls on the stairs, she already suspects that something is wrong. But as soon as she sees the sadness in your eyes, her worst fears are confirmed.</p>
<p>You comfort Delissa as best you can and assure her that Hulsta’s sacrifice was not in vain. ‘The Vorka have been destroyed and the Runes of Agarash have been shattered,’ you tell her, ‘yet without Hulsta, this vital mission could not have been accomplished.’ Your thoughtful words ease her sorrow, but before she has had time to grieve the loss of her husband, she is suddenly confronted by a threat to her own survival.</p>
<p>You can hear soldiers with dogs running along the alleyway behind the yard. You wait for them to disappear, but to your shocked surprise, they suddenly stop and bang on the rear gate and demand to be let in.</p>
<p>‘Quick! Go and change into some of Hulsta’s clothes. You’ll find them in there,’ she says, and she points to a closet door. ‘I’ll go down to the yard and try to get rid of them.’</p>
<p>You do as she says and quickly you discard your Eldenoran tunic and breeches. You bundle them together with your Kai journeyman clothes, and then you dress quickly in a shirt, breeches, and jacket that you find in the closet. The clothes are a little too large but you do not mind. Only when you pull on a pair of Hulsta’s boots do you thank Ishir that they are a perfect fit. You are about to reach for one of Hulsta’s caps when suddenly you hear soldiers and dogs entering the yard.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to find somewhere in the parlour where you can hide, <a href="sect152.htm">turn to 152</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to stay where you are and wait for Delissa to return, <a href="sect59.htm">turn to 59</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to go to the door and observe what is going on outside, <a href="sect210.htm">turn to 210</a>.</p>
