<h3>288</h3>

<p>The emporium is filled with exotic rugs and unusually fine wall coverings. It strikes you that the quality of these goods is uncommonly high, far better than one would normally expect to find in a back-street shop such as this. It is not until you take a closer look at the tapestries that you realize that these goods have all been looted from rich estates and churches in Salony, Lyris, and Delden.</p>
<p>The owner approaches and asks what you have to sell. Clearly he assumes that you have come here to dispose of some war booty. ‘I’ve nothing to sell,’ you reply, ‘but I would be grateful for some information. Can you tell me the way to Flank Street? I understand that it is somewhere in the Northern Quarter.’</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> (in this instance, 0 = 10).</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have picked is 3 or lower, <a href="sect11.htm">turn to 11</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4 or higher, <a href="sect341.htm">turn to 341</a>.</p>
