<h3>290</h3>

<p>You return to the main highway and ride south towards Tekaro. It is a dry, windy day and you spend most of it in the saddle. As you draw closer to the city, so the number of Eldenorans you encounter steadily increases. Fortunately, they are too preoccupied with their marching and other duties to spare a lowly horse-scout more than a second glance.</p>
<p>The sun has set and dusk is surrendering to darkness by the time you reach Tekaro. The rolling fields around this old walled city are swarming with Vorka regiments, and the fetid smell of their scaly hides gusts towards you on the chill night breeze.</p>
<p>You can see the cathedral spire of the city silhouetted against the starry sky, and a yellowy glow of torchlight radiates from a tower above its fortified North Gate. You magnify your vision and see that the gate itself is open and unguarded.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue along the highway and enter the city of Tekaro by its North Gate, <a href="sect82.htm">turn to 82</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to circle around the city in an attempt to reach the River Storn before the night is over, <a href="sect143.htm">turn instead to 143</a>.</p>
