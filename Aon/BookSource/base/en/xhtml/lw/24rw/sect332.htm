<h3>332</h3>

<p>You intone the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mind Charm</i> as the guard pulls open the closet door. Quickly he finds your clothes and weapons, but you complete the spell just in time to prevent him from raising the alarm. Silently you command the guard to put down the items he has found and step away from the closet. He obeys your order, and as he closes the closet door, you tell him to erase from his memory all trace of what he has seen.</p>
<p>‘There’s nothing here,’ he calls out to his comrade. ‘Let’s be on our way. We’ve other places to check before dawn.’</p>
<p>The two guards call off their search and leave, dragging their yelping dog behind them. Delissa stays in the yard and waits until they have all left; then she quickly returns to the parlour and locks the door behind her.</p>
