<h3>37</h3>

<p>The soldier hurls his rock and it smashes into the planking near your feet. It tears a hole in the bottom of the boat and a spout of water gushes into the air to rain down upon your canvas cover. The Eldenorans cheer as your boat begins to founder, and as it disappears from view beneath the centre arch, you hear their echoing footfalls as they rush across to the opposite side of the bridge to wait for it to reappear.</p>
<p>When you emerge the Eldenorans give a cheer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must abandon the boat. You turn the rudder towards the left bank and aim your sinking craft at a place where willow trees overhang the river. As you pass beneath their branches, you clamber out and quickly take cover among the trees.</p>
<p>The Eldenorans soon arrive to inspect their handiwork. Silently you observe them as they drag the half-submerged boat out of the water and sift through its meagre contents. They soon tire of this and return to their duties. When the coast is clear, you leave the trees and hurry away from the bridge. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans, you stop to rest for a few hours in the bough of an oak.</p>
<p>Before you sleep, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
