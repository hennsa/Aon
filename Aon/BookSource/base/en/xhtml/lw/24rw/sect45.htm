<h3>45</h3>

<p>‘Very well, I’ll pay what you ask,’ you reply. Quickly the guards wave the wagon through into the city and then they lower the portcullis and order the following traffic to wait while they escort you to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they are going to renege on their deal and throw you in a cell regardless, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: ‘Don’t worry, friend. We’ll jus’ go somewhere private. We don’t want all o’ Duadon to know our business.’</p>
<p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall. You hand over the 10 Gold Crowns (erase these from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>) and the guards unlock the door. It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city’s south wall. ‘Off y’go, trooper,’ says the tall guard, as he pushes you through the arched doorway.</p>
<p>The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. You leave the door and walk along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed. They trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan’s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
<p>You recall Gwynian’s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city’s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that is heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you are about to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>
