<h3>52</h3>

<p>You have successfully beaten back the first Vorka wave, but a larger group is now emerging from the distant archway. Each of these warriors wields a sword and is clad in chainmail armour. Fear grips your stomach when you realize that they are the advance guard of a whole Vorka regiment. Once more you turn your attention to the bell-chamber, for only by destroying the rune can you hope to defeat the entire horde.</p>
<p>You descend halfway down the stairs, and then leap over the banister and drop to the floor of the pit below. On landing, those unarmed Vorka who are defending the rune hiss at you vehemently. Their sibilant cry warns their armoured brothers of your intentions and you see them quicken their pace. Your pulse pounds loudly in your ears as you determine that the first of the armoured regiment can reach you in less than a minute. There is no time to hesitate—you must act at once. With your battle-cry upon your lips, you rush forward and attack the Vorka who are standing in a protective wall before the rune.</p>
