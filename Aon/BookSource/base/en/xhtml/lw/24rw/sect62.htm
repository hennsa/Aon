<h3>62</h3>

<p>You grab Hulsta’s strong hand and he hauls you towards the opening. As your legs emerge from the water, the giant snake breaks through the surface and it gouges your calves with its venomous fangs.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If the number you have chosen is odd (i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), you lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If the number is even (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0), you lose 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Hulsta drags you through the opening and lays you down on the floor of the tunnel. Then he pushes the heavy iron grill back into position. Moments later, the head of the giant snake slams against this grill and you hear the murderous clack of its fanged jaw before it dives back into the river.</p>
<p>Fortunately, your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus quickly neutralizes the small amount of venom that has entered your bloodstream. You sit up and Hulsta uses strips of cloth torn from the hem of his shirt to bandage your wounded calves. As he helps you to your feet, you are pleased to see that your dangerous detour along the underground river was not in vain, for you now find yourself standing in a section of the tunnel which lies beyond the blocking wall.</p>
