<h3>71</h3>

<p>You cross the corridor and approach the door. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that the chamber beyond it is empty, and so you twist the handle and push against the heavy portal. Silently it swings open on well-oiled hinges to reveal an empty circular room. A large iron-rimmed chute is set into its stone wall, and when you examine this opening, your stomach churns. Its surfaces are smeared with traces of human blood. You can hear the distant sound of rushing water and suddenly you realize that this chute leads directly to the river which flows beneath Duadon. From its condition and location you conclude that this chute has a single, sinister purpose: it is used by the gaolers of Skull-Tor for the swift disposal of prisoners who die in their charge.</p>
<p>As you turn to leave this grim chamber, you notice a Mace and a Small Shovel standing propped against the wall, close to the door. If you wish to take either of these items, record them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. Upon leaving, you close the door behind you before continuing along the corridor.</p>
