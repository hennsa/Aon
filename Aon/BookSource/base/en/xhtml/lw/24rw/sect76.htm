<h3>76</h3>

<p>Silently you intone the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Mind Charm</i> and order the Guard Captain to set you free. You also command him mentally to forget that he has ever set eyes on you upon the instant that you leave his chamber. The captain obeys without question. He calls his guards and tells them to set you free in Duadon immediately. They are shocked and surprised to hear this, but they dare not contradict their superior officer.</p>
<p>Reluctantly the guards march you away. They escort you along a corridor which leads to an empty room where a small door is set into a stone wall. It opens on to a quiet alleyway that is overshadowed by the city’s south battlements.</p>
<p>‘Be off with you!’ growls the tall guard, as he pushes you roughly through the arched doorway. The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. Quickly you leave this door and walk briskly along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed. They trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan’s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
<p>You recall Gwynian’s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city’s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you attempt to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads which lead off from the South Gate square, to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>
