<h3>82</h3>

<p>Warily you ride through the north gate of Tekaro, taking care to avoid the watchful gaze of the grim-faced Eldenorans who are manning its fortified tower. Beyond the gate you enter a broad street lit by hanging lanterns. Drunken soldiers reel and sprawl along the alleyways that feed into this main avenue, and patrols of military reeves attempt in vain to maintain some semblance of order. Houses stand barred and barricaded, and the frightened eyes of native Tekaroans squint through their shuttered windows at the raucous enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>The street curves in a gentle arc towards the east and ends at a flagstoned square which is dominated by a large bronze fountain. You are about to enter the square when suddenly a patrol of military reeves comes marching around a corner, forcing you to halt to avoid colliding with them. At first their sharp-eyed sergeant simply glowers at you, but then he proceeds to scrutinize your uniform and your horse. Gruffly he demands to know what you are doing in this part of the city. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that he has noticed that the regimental number on the sleeve of your tunic does not tally with any of the regiments billeted in Tekaro, and you suspect he is thinking that you are deserter.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Elementalism and have attained the rank of Kai Grand Defender, <a href="sect199.htm">turn to 199</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, or if you have yet to attain this level of Kai Mastery, <a href="sect25.htm">turn to 25</a>.</p>
