<h3>1</h3>

<p>You decide to begin your air voyage to the Shezar Hills at first light the following day. In the few hours which remain before dawn, both you and Banedon make final preparations for the long journey west. You summon to your chambers Winter Oak, a Kai Archmaster, and tell him of the mission you are about to undertake at daybreak. He is the most senior member of the garrison and you place him in command during your absence. The Kai crusaders are expected to arrive in two days’ time, and it will be his duty to inform them of your whereabouts and to keep the monastery safe until you and Lone Wolf return.</p>
<p>Having completed your preparations, you sleep for a few hours and rise shortly before dawn. Lord Rimoah escorts you to the monastery training park where, hovering above, you see the sleek hull of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> glinting in the moonlight. Rimoah has chosen not to accompany you on the voyage. Instead, he will remain here at the monastery and maintain contact with Banedon by means of a seeing stone. One of the ship’s lookouts sees you crossing the park below and he orders a boarding cage to be lowered from the stern deck. As you wait for it to touch the ground, Rimoah takes from his pocket a sigil of platinum fixed upon a loop of braided twine. He presses the amulet into your hand and insists that you wear it at all times.</p>
<p>‘It is an artefact imbued with Old Kingdom magic,’ he says, sagely. ‘It has protective powers that may help you when you enter Gazad Helkona. Lone Wolf possesses a similar sigil, and I am sure that it has helped him to resist Zorkaan thus far.’</p>
<p>You accept the sigil and slip its braided noose over your head. (Record this Platinum Amulet on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you wear around your neck. You need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>
