<h3>104</h3>

<p>You watch with grim glee as the heavy statue falls end-over-end towards the ascending Drakkarim warriors. The assault trooper drops his sword and throws up his hands as the great bronze effigy slams into him with a sickening crunch. Groaning in agony, his skull and ribs crushed by the impact, he somersaults backwards and tumbles down the stairs, felling his comrades like skittles as he careers through their ranks. The few who are not bowled over by their leader, or the crushing statue of Chlanzor, immediately open fire at you with their crossbows and force you to seek cover behind the parapet. As you crouch beside Lone Wolf, a sudden shriek echoes across the observatory platform. Then an icy chill courses through your veins when you turn and look over your shoulder.</p>
