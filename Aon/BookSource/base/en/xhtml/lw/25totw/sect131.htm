<h3>131</h3>

<p>As the last of the trio falls victim to your deadly blows, you step away from his crumpled body and sheathe your bloodied weapon. Your senses detect that there are no other bandits lurking in this chamber, and when you scour its walls and furnishings, you realize that it is a mess hall used by Xaol’s bandit mercenaries and guards. Stale fragments of food litter the tables, and the acrid smell of wine and torch oil hangs heavily in the clammy air.</p>
<p>There is a trapdoor located near the tunnel exit from this hall, and on closer examination you discover that it covers a chute. Judging from the foul stench arising from this opening, you determine that the chute must descend to a cesspool located somewhere deep below the fortress blockhouse. To reduce the risk of their bodies ever being found, you drop the slain bandits down the chute and then push the trapdoor shut.</p>
<p class="choice">If you now wish to search the mess hall, <a href="sect333.htm">turn to 333</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to leave the hall via the tunnel exit, <a href="sect55.htm">turn to 55</a>.</p>
