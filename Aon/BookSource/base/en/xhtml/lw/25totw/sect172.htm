<h3>172</h3>

<p>The noise of the explosion is reverberating around the hall as the possessed body of Xaol rises up from the floor and extends its twisted arms towards you. An unholy fire blazes in the eyes of the dead necromancer as his corpse moves across the hall towards you with unnatural speed. You pray to the Goddess Ishir for her protection as this ghastly zombie leaps upon you and attempts to fix its corpse-cold hands around your throat.</p>
<p class="combat">Xaol Zombie <em>(possessed by Zorkaan)</em>: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 55   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 43</p>
<p>This possessed creature is immune to psychic attack. If your Kai Weapon is ‘Alema’ or ‘Valiance’, you may add the appropriate bonus gained through their unique properties. You may reduce the total damage inflicted upon you by 5 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points due to the protection you gain from wearing the Platinum Amulet. However, unless you possess the Discipline of Kai-screen, you must reduce your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 3 for the duration of this combat.</p>
<p class="choice">Conduct this combat in the normal way for three rounds only. If you survive these initial rounds, you may continue by <a href="sect260.htm">turning to 260</a>.</p>
