<h3>292</h3>

<p>Quickly you unshoulder your pack and tip the Dargorse Buds onto the floor. Then you slip away and take cover behind the next statue in the line. The slavering wolfhound comes loping around the statue and begins to snuffle among the buds. It is now that you notice there are two other items lying on the floor, they fell from your pack when you jettisoned the buds (erase from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> the items you have recorded in the second and third spaces of your <a href="action.htm">list of Backpack Items</a>).</p>
<p>Suddenly the wolfhound emits a loud yelp of pain, and you see its nose redden and swell. The buds contain a powerful irritant that has inflamed the lining of the creature’s nostrils. The hound howls with pain and the bandits howl with laughter when they see its bright red nose. As the injured wolfhound lopes away, the bandits stop to investigate the cause of its misfortune.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to leave your hiding place and attempt to slip past the bandits while they are examining your lost Backpack Items, <a href="sect327.htm">turn to 327</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to stay hidden behind the statue, <a href="sect35.htm">turn to 35</a>.</p>
