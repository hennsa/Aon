<h3>339</h3>

<p>The bodies of the slain Drakkarim lie slumped against the door. They keep it from closing and allow the grey half-light of Gazad Helkona to pierce the gloom of an entrance hall that lies beyond. You drag the dead warriors into this empty hall by their feet, and hide their corpses in a dark recess behind one of the pillars which support its high ceiling. Then you close the main door and bolt it shut before exploring any further.</p>
<p>The circular walls of this hall are bedecked with battered shields and torn banners, captured in battle during the Darklands War. Lit by the oily glow of a solitary sputtering Lantern, you can see a crude wooden table and two chairs in the middle of the hall. A pair of Bone Dice rests on the table and two Spears lie on the floor beside it. (If you want to keep any of these items, adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p>You are scanning the walls when you notice an archway opposite the main door, leading to a flight of stone steps. Cautiously you cross to the archway and ascend the steps to a landing on the level above.</p>
