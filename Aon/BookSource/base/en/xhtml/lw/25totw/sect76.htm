<h3>76</h3>

<p>One of the bandits becomes curious and he glances behind the statue. When he sees you hiding in the shadows he yelps with surprise, and reaches for the sword sheathed in his belt. You beat him to the draw and lunge at his chest with your Kai Weapon, running him through. He sways on his feet, his knuckles white on his sword hilt; then his strength deserts him and he keels over backwards onto the hard stone floor. The wolfhound yelps and runs off, but the remaining bandit stands his ground.</p>
<p>‘Prepare to die, raven-bait!’ he spits, as he unsheathes his heavy sword from its leather scabbard.</p>
