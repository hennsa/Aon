<h3>105</h3>

<p>You cast your eye along a line of war engines that are parked beside the shield, and at the far end of the line you see an oil lamp resting on a workbench. As you stare at the flickering lamp, a bold idea begins to take shape in your mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Carefully you tear a strip of cloth from the hem of your jacket, twist it into a taper, and grip it firmly in your fist. Then you begin to make your way slowly towards the workbench. You reach it without being detected by the minions, and here you soak the end of your cloth taper with lamp oil and set it alight. As soon as the way is clear, you leap up from behind the bench and dash towards the cannon, the burning taper held before you at arm’s length.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Agarashi commander sees you running across the hall. With a disdainful laugh, it raises its clawed hand and takes careful aim at your fleeing form.</p>
