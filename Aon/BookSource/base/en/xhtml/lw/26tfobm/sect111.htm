<h3>111</h3>

<p>The lantern begins to rock from side to side, but the squeak of its rusty chain captures the creature’s attention. It looks to the lantern, and then it looks to your hiding place among the barrels and instantly it detects you. The creature emits a loud, hellish shriek, and you feel a fiery pain welling up inside your skull as a powerful stream of destructive psychic energy batters your mind. Rapidly the pressure builds in your head until your skull feels fit to burst. Your vision is clouded by a scarlet haze, and you are unable to stifle a cry of pain as you collapse to your knees: lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p>Desperately you struggle to erect a defensive wall around the core of your mind, using your power of Psi-screen. Slowly, as your mental defences lock together, the pain eases and your vision clears. Through the receding red mist you see a group of Shom’zaa Agarashi closing in on you with their swords drawn. You force yourself to stand, and you unsheathe your Kai Weapon just in time to meet their determined attack.</p>
<p class="combat">Shom’zaa Agarashi: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 40   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 30</p>
