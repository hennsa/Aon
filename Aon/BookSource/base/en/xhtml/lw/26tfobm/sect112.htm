<h3>112</h3>

<p>As you strike your killing blow, the giant steamspider rears up on its hairy legs and topples backwards into the river. For a few moments its loathsome carcass is buoyed along on the current; then slowly it sinks beneath the foaming waters and disappears from view.</p>
<p>You keep your Weapon to hand as cautiously you explore the cavern. You are wary that there may be other creatures lurking in the depths of its craggy hollows, waiting to attack. However, you soon discover that the cavern had only one occupant and it is now empty.</p>
<p>The only exit is the natural tunnel in the west wall through which the underground river flows away. Carefully you test the water and discover that it is hot, although not unbearably so. You resolve to try to escape from the cavern by way of this river, and before you lower yourself into its steamy water, you make sure that all of your Weapons and equipment are secure. Upon entering the river you are carried away by the swift current and swept beneath the tunnel’s low arch.</p>
