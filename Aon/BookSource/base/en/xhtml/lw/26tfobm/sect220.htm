<h3>220</h3>

<p>You follow the newly-laid wagon track along the tunnel until you are brought to a halt by the sound of enemy activity in a cavern ahead. Cautiously you make your approach, using the cover afforded by pit props which support the roof of this recent excavation. Rows of ore wagons are parked here, each filled with precious korlinium ore. A large group of more than 50 Shom’zaa Agarashi are standing around them, shrieking and gesticulating at each other. They have no commander to keep them in order, and they have been left in a state of panic and confusion following the destruction of Shom’zaa.</p>
<p>Aided by your Kai camouflage skills, you have little difficulty slipping past these creatures and continuing along a tunnel in the opposite wall. This wide passageway brings you back to ‘The Hub’, but as you approach this familiar cavern, your blood is chilled by the sight of what awaits you there.</p>
