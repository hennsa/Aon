<h3>225</h3>

<p>Swiftly you leave the track and leap through the tall crops, pitching and stumbling among their tough stalks as you race to get away from the approaching riders. You change direction repeatedly, using your Magnakai Pathsmanship skills to weave through the wheat without leaving any sign of your passing. This tactic soon throws them off your scent, and within a short while you feel confident that they have lost your trail.</p>
<p>You have just crossed into an adjoining field of barley when suddenly a barrier of piercing light erupts in front of you as first one explosion and then three more detonate among the crops. In a desperate attempt to flush you out, the riders are hurling incendiary bombs into the fields. Within seconds the tinder-dry crops are ablaze, fanned by a stiff breeze. You retreat to the wheat field to avoid the roaring flames, but as you retrace your steps, your Sixth Sense tells you that you are being forced back into a trap.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue retreating into the wheat field to avoid the approaching fire, <a href="sect194.htm">turn to 194</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to pass through the wall of fire and reach the safety of the barley fields beyond, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
