<h3>280</h3>

<p>The empty powder barrel offers you no protection from the enemy’s crossbow bolts. Before you can seek harder cover, you are spotted by the reinforcements as they enter the cavern. The leading Shom’zaa Agarashi raise their spears and come rushing towards you, shrieking like demons. You reach for your Kai Weapon, but then you stay your hand. To fight these creatures would be suicidal for they number more than a hundred. Your only hope of survival lies at the barricade.</p>
<p>You spring to your feet and race across the body-strewn ground towards the distant throne chamber. As you emerge from a cloud of cannon smoke drifting across the cavern, the dwarven defenders see you approaching. Some of them recognize you are a Kai Lord by the cut and colour of your tunic, and a hearty cheer arises from the barricade. Arrows and crossbow bolts whistle past as the Shom’zaa horde attempts to prevent you from reaching the throne chamber alive. Then you hear the loud report of muskets and pistols as Drodarin marksmen give covering fire from the barricade.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 2 to the number you have picked. If your current <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points score is 20 or less, deduct 2.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 3 or lower, <a href="sect333.htm">turn to 333</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4–7, <a href="sect296.htm">turn to 296</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 8 or higher, <a href="sect124.htm">turn to 124</a>.</p>
