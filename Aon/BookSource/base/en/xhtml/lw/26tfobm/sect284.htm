<h3>284</h3>

<p>You raise your hands and rapidly recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <i>Counterspell</i>. The air shimmers before your face as the spell takes effect, and the deadly blast of ice is transformed into a harmless stream of lukewarm water.</p>
<p>Your unexpected use of magic to counter the creature’s icy attack shocks the watching minions. Nervously they back away, defying the hysterical shrieking of their cadaverous commander who orders them to attack you <i xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>. Before they can rally themselves and carry out the order, you steal away into a section of the vast laboratory that is crowded with siege machinery and engines of war. Here you take cover behind a large shield on wheels and observe the Shom’zaa minions as they mill about in confusion.</p>
<p>Suddenly their commander recaptures their attention by freezing two luckless minions to death with another icy blast. When he then commands the portcullis to be lowered to prevent your escape, a zealous minion rushes forward and begins hacking at its securing rope with a battle-axe. The rope snaps, and you watch with horror as the portcullis comes crashing down to seal off the exit.</p>
