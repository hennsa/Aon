<h3>291</h3>

<p>You hit the ground and the whistling salvo passes harmlessly over your head. Quickly you crawl forward until you are out of the line of fire, and then you scramble to your feet and race towards the distant vault.</p>
<p>As you run, you hear the terrible roar of a fireball come surging towards your back. You throw yourself through the vault’s arched entrance and roll to one side. It is a timely action, one that saves you from being scorched by the missile as it whooshes past and explodes among the treasures stored here. As its fire dies out, you hear another sound—the dull <i>clunk!</i> of the arrow-trap resetting itself.</p>
<p>You glance back into the passageway and see that your pursuer has now reached the floor slab, triggering a second volley of deadly arrows. Unable to turn in the narrow confines of the passage, it is skewered by more than a dozen of these bone-tipped shafts. With a hellish shriek, the creature’s corpulent body erupts into a great ball of flame. It burns with such fierce intensity that, within minutes, it is reduced to a heap of white-hot ash.</p>
