<h3>294</h3>

<p>You cradle Prince Leomin’s head in the crook of your arm and attempt to heal the terrible wounds that the corrosive fluid has inflicted. Sadly, you discover it is too late to save him.</p>
<p>It was Leomin’s greed that caused the release of Shom’zaa and its ravening horde, yet he was a brave warrior nonetheless. His last courageous act saved your life, and for that you will always be grateful. You lay his head gently upon the ground and offer up a prayer to Ishir to watch over his soul. Perhaps, one day, his kinsfolk will forgive and forget his weaknesses and come to honour the memory of this brave warrior prince.</p>
<p>You resolve to return at once to the Throne Chamber of Andarin. You have completed one vital part of your mission—the destruction of Shom’zaa. Now you must help secure the remaining goal—the protection of the Throne of Andarin. With this aim in mind, you leave Shom’zaa’s lair and hurry back to the hole through which you entered the hive. Here you stop to scan the cavern beyond before venturing any further.</p>
<p>The narrow tunnel, along which you first entered the cavern, is silent and empty. By contrast, the wagon-tracked passage leading off to the south now echoes to the sound of anguished cries. They are the shrieks of Shom’zaa’s minions. The death of their master has been felt among their ranks, and although they survive for now, they know that without his power they are ultimately doomed.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to retrace your steps to the basket, <a href="sect242.htm">turn to 242</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to explore the south passage, <a href="sect68.htm">turn to 68</a>.</p>
