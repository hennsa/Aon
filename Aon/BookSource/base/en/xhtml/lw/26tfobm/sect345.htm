<h3>345</h3>

<p>Your killing blow pitches the Shom’zaa lancer out of its saddle and sends its lifeless body tumbling into the wheat, trailing a stream of black ichor. As its steed flees through the tall crops, you notice a bulb-like object fall from its saddlebag. You take a closer look and discover that it is an unexploded Phosphor Bomb. (If you wish to keep this item, record it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.) Then you hear the sound of the other riders approaching, and quickly you dive into the tall crops and hurry away towards the north to avoid them.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, when you can no longer hear the lancers crashing through the wheat, you begin to feel confident that they have lost your trail for good. You have just crossed into an adjoining crop of barley when suddenly a barrier of piercing light erupts in front of you as first one explosion and then two more detonate among the plants. In a desperate attempt to flush you out, the riders are hurling phosphor bombs into the fields. Within seconds the tinder-dry crops are ablaze, fanned by a stiff breeze. You retreat to the wheat field to avoid the roaring flames but, as you retrace your steps, your Sixth Sense tells you that you are being forced back into a trap.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to continue retreating into the wheat field to avoid the approaching fire, <a href="sect194.htm">turn to 194</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to pass through the wall of fire and reach the safety of the barley fields beyond, <a href="sect42.htm">turn to 42</a>.</p>
