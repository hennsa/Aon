<h3>37</h3>

<p>You trek across five fields of barley before you come to the far side of this titanic cavern. Several cart tracks converge at the approach to a wide stone ramp that ascends to the mouth of an unguarded tunnel in the cavern wall. You climb the ramp and, as you enter this torchlit tunnel, you discover a number of broken weapons lying discarded on the ground. Among them you find 1 Arrow and a Sword that are still serviceable. (If you decide to keep them, adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p>You follow the tunnel for several hundred yards until you come to a junction where a smaller passageway leads off to the right. A stone plaque that once indicated the name of this passage lies smashed in pieces. You are trying to put the pieces back together when suddenly you hear the sound of Brozal riders approaching along the main tunnel. Quickly you move into the shadowy passageway and use your camouflage skills to hide there as you wait for the riders to pass.</p>
<p>While you are waiting, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect283.htm">turn to 283</a>.</p>
