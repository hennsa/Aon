<h3>55</h3>

<p>As the last of their riders falls from the saddle, the Brozal steeds turn and flee for their lives. You sheathe your Weapon and call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control to command one of these fleeing mounts to calm itself. Responding to your mental suggestion, it slows rapidly to a halt.</p>
<p>You summon the Brozal to approach you and it responds again with calm obedience. Deftly you climb onto the creature’s scaly back and settle yourself in the saddle; then you turn it towards the east and urge it to enter the tall wheat. Carefully you skirt around the area of blazing crops before turning again, this time to the north.</p>
<p>The Brozal lopes through the yellow stalks with a swift and easy gait, and you cover ground at a far swifter pace than would be possible on foot. But when you come unexpectedly to a muddy ditch, a boundary between the wheat and a neighbouring crop of barley, the Brozal misses its footing. It stumbles badly and you are thrown headlong from the saddle.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 1 to the number you have picked.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 4 or lower, <a href="sect92.htm">turn to 92</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5 or higher, <a href="sect122.htm">turn to 122</a>.</p>
