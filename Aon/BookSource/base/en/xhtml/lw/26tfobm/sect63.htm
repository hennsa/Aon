<h3>63</h3>

<p>The basket lands at the base of the shaft and you see a freshly-excavated tunnel stretching away to the east. You leave the basket and, as you follow the prince, you notice that the walls of this passage are layered with a fibrous mineral that shimmers like strands of polished silver. Now you understand what tempted Leomin to defy ancient Drodarin lore and mine the lower levels of Bor, for these are strands of pure korlinium—the rarest of minerals. You feel its raw energy revitalizing you as you walk along the tunnel (restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points), yet you cannot help but conclude how foolish it was of Leomin to succumb to his temptation. For centuries the goodly power of this mineral has acted like the bars of a prison, keeping Shom’zaa and its horde secure.</p>
<p>At length you arrive at a small cavern where a section of wall has collapsed.</p>
<p>‘That is where the Shom’zaa horde emerged,’ says Leomin, pointing to the gaping hole. Mining tools litter the floor of this chamber, and you see a wider passage leading off to the south. It is laid with track for wagons to carry away the korlinium ore. When you magnify your vision, you see a group of Shom’zaa Agarashi at the far end of this passage.</p>
