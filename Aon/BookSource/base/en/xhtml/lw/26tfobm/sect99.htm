<h3>99</h3>

<p>The lever clicks down and a secret panel in the wall slides open to reveal a narrow passage. As you are peering along this gloomy tunnel, suddenly the heavy chamber door bursts open and slams against the wall.</p>
<p>An icy trickle of fear runs down your back when you turn to look upon the squat creature that is now framed in the doorway. It has a bloated, veined body and waxy skin that is as pale as a frozen corpse. From its fanged mouth there flickers a forked tongue, and its scarlet eye-slits radiate an evil light that chills you to the bone. It advances into the chamber with its arms outstretched, as if it is walking in its sleep. Then it turns and points its arms at you, and its clenched fists begin to glow like two balls of red-hot plasma.</p>
<p>You take hold of the stonework that frames the secret panel and pull yourself towards the narrow passageway. You are only halfway through the opening when two orbs of living flame leap from the creature’s glowing fists and come arcing towards your spine.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 2 to the number you have picked. If you possess Assimilance, add 1.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 0–1, <a href="sect44.htm">turn to 44</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 2–3, <a href="sect262.htm">turn to 262</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4 or higher, <a href="sect30.htm">turn to 30</a>.</p>
