<h3>128</h3>

<p>‘Come! We must pursue the enemy without delay,’ says Gildas, excitedly. ‘They must not be allowed to steal away the Claw.’</p>
<p>‘Hold, Captain,’ you retort. ‘The enemy is too strong. They outnumber us, and they possess a weapon that can slay us all but with one bolt. Do you not recall what happened at Sunderer Pass? You have lost one good man already. Surely you have no wish to risk our lives in a reckless pursuit.’</p>
<p>‘Are you abandoning your mission, Sir Kai?’ he asks, reproachfully.</p>
<p>‘No, Captain,’ you reply. ‘My vow to retrieve the Claw and oversee its destruction remains true. I merely propose we pursue the enemy at a safe distance. They may run with the Claw of Naar, but they cannot keep it from us forever. The tracker-gem that you placed in the haft will lead us to it, no matter where they may choose to carry it.’</p>
<p>‘You are right, Sir Kai,’ says Gildas, apologetically.</p>
<p>‘Firstly, we shall rest and recover our strength,’ you say. ‘Then we shall hunt down our enemies and reclaim that accursed artefact before it can be delivered to Autarch Sejanoz.’</p>
<p>Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
