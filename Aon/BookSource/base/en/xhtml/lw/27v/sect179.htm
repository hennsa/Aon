<h3>179</h3>

<p>You rise at daybreak and ready yourself for a long march south across the vast Bhanarian Plain. Using your Kai tracking skills, you have no difficulty following the trail that has been left by the Imperial Guards. Their footprints can clearly be seen upon the surface of a dusty track that cuts across the rolling grasslands.</p>
<p>As you march along this derelict plains road, you are bathed by the warm rays of the rising sun. It is a beautiful day, yet you notice that your companions are in a sad and sombre mood. They are mourning the loss of their comrade, Durasso, and they do not feel much like talking.</p>
<p>Fifteen miles from the Dammerdon foothills, you come to a wooden bridge that crosses a stream of sparkling water. Here you lose your enemy’s trail for the track has been freshly churned by dozens of hoof prints. You magnify your vision and scan the far horizon, but all that you see are a few roving black Bhanarian stallions. You check the trail once more, and then your heart sinks when suddenly you realize that your enemy must have captured some of these fine wild horses. If they are now travelling on horseback, your only hope of catching them will rest on your ability to capture four wild stallions for yourselves.</p>
