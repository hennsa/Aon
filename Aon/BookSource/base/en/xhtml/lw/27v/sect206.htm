<h3>206</h3>

<p>You observe that the bridge at Zuda is occupied by Bhanarian soldiers. Their tented encampments are dotted around the approach road and river bank, and the line of their supply wagons stretches away to the west.</p>
<p>The tiger’s-head flag of Autarch Sejanoz now flies over Zuda. This border town has been overrun by his army within the last 24 hours. At first you suspect that this could be the start of a war between Bhanar and Chai, but your Kai senses tell you that this is no ordinary military operation. This army has come here for one purpose—to ensure the recovery of the Claw of Naar.</p>

<p>You hold sombre council with the rangers and try to determine how best to proceed from here. ‘I propose we try to reach the Chai Wall,’ says Gildas, and his men readily agree. Having never heard of this edifice, you ask Gildas to explain. ‘The Chai Wall is a line of forts and military defences that lies 60 miles to the east of Zuda,’ he says. ‘Invasion from Bhanar has long been a threat to Chai, but its ancient ruler—Khea-khan Xo—had remarkable foresight. He constructed a formidable wall to deter Autarch Sejanoz from invading his peaceful realm. It has served Chai well for many centuries.’</p>
<p>You thank Gildas for this history lesson, but you question its accuracy. ‘I was taught at the Kai Monastery that the reign of Khea-khan Xo was more than a thousand years ago. Surely his enemy then was not the same Autarch Sejanoz who rules Bhanar now?’</p>
<p>‘Ah, but he is!’ replies Gildas. ‘Sejanoz has ruled this land for 3,000 years. Legend says that he entered into a pact with Agarash the Damned. In return for his soul he received … immortality.’</p>
<p>As you look upon the flag of Autarch Sejanoz fluttering high above the buildings of Zuda, a growing sense of foreboding creeps upon you and it leaves a chill in your blood.</p>
