<h3>227</h3>

<p>Thinking that you are provisioners from one of the other wagons, the driver is glad to accept your offer to help gather up the vegetables that lie strewn across the paved street. The raised hoods of your robes help keep your faces in shadow, and he fails to recognize that you are not native Bhanarians. Then one of the iron doors in the northern wall creaks open, and a barracks guard barks an order to the waiting drivers to begin delivering their loads by hand. A collective groan arises from the line of parked wagons, but for you and your companions it proves to be a perfect opportunity to enter the barracks undetected.</p>
<p>Each of you takes a box of provisions from the rear of the wagon and joins in the line of drivers as they file through the iron door. You follow this line to a kitchen store room, located near the middle of the barracks complex, where you deposit your delivery and then return to the street to collect another box. As you are making your way back, you pass a door that your Kai senses tell you is unlocked. Quickly you slip inside and then signal to your companions to follow. When all of you are safely inside, you close the door and draw its bolt.</p>
