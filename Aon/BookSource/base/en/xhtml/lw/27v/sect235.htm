<h3>235</h3>

<p>You launch a Mindblast at the angry sergeant and he reels back, clutching his head in pain. Your sudden psychic attack soon renders him unconscious, but you catch him before his limp body crumples to the ground.</p>
<p>You call out to the gate guards to come and help you. You say their sergeant has been taken ill, and quickly they respond. As they lift him out of your arms, you motion to your companions to follow as you slip away into the barracks.</p>
<p>Beyond the main gate is a courtyard where several wagons, filled with provisions, are being unloaded. You and your companions each take a box from the rear of the nearest wagon and join a line of men who are delivering their goods to a kitchen store room located near the middle of the barracks complex. You leave your boxes here and then return to the courtyard to collect some more. As you are making your way back, you pass a door that your Kai senses tell you is unlocked. You quickly step inside and then signal to the rangers to follow. When all of you are safely in, you shut the door and draw its bolt.</p>
