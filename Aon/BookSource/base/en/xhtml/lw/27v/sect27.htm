<h3>27</h3>

<p>You inform Gildas and the others of your discovery, and tell them to rest awhile beneath the wooden bridge while you attempt to lure a distant group of stallions towards the stream. By the use of your Animal Mastery, you are soon able to entice four horses to approach the bridge. At first they are nervous, for they can detect the vile stench of the Doomlands’ dust which impregnates the rangers’ tunics. But they are also thirsty and they cannot resist the temptation of the sparkling stream.</p>
<p>You allow them to drink at the stream for several minutes and, as they settle, you use your Kai Mastery to subdue their natural instincts. At your command, Gildas and the others emerge from beneath the bridge and each man chooses a stallion. They are all expert horsemen, and they are able to make bridles and saddlecloths from ropes and blankets that they carry in their packs, Within the hour, all four of you are ready to leave the bridge and ride south in pursuit of the Imperial Guards.</p>
<p>Before you set off, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
