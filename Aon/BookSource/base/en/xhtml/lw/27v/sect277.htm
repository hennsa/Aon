<h3>277</h3>

<p>As the Xanon bellows its death-cry and crumples to the ground, you see six of its kin come galloping along beside the west wall of the ruin. Fearful that these determined creatures could overwhelm your position if they chose to attack simultaneously, you command Gildas and the rangers to abandon their positions and escape to the east. Together you leap onto your horses and, as the captain leads his men away at the gallop, you stay and fight a brave rearguard action to delay the battling Xanon.</p>
<p>With ice-cool nerve and deadly grace, you wield your Kai Weapon to deadly effect. Your blows shatter Xanon skulls and smash their lances, forcing them to abandon any hope of following the rangers as they make good their escape across the plain. But when the time comes for you to follow your fleeing companions, a thrusting lance blow to the middle of your back nearly unhorses you. You hang on desperately to the mane of your frightened mount as he leaps over the wall and carries you away.</p>
<p>You rejoin the rangers at the top of a grassy rise that overlooks the ancient ruins. The triumphant cries of the Xanon are carried to you on the wind, and when you magnify your vision, you see they have gathered in a group in the ruins of the hall. One of their number appears to be holding aloft a short staff. You focus upon it and your heart sinks when you see that it is the Claw of Naar!</p>
