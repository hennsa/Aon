<h3>283</h3>

<p>The fortune-teller becomes irate. He stands up and stabs at the air with his index finger as he threatens to report you to the City Guards. Gildas takes hold of his wagging finger and bends it back, forcing him to his knees. The man whimpers like a frightened puppy and says he has changed his mind. He will forget all about your supposed debt. You leave the table, and as you walk towards the tavern door, Gildas releases the trickster. He motions his rangers to accompany him as he follows you to the door.</p>
