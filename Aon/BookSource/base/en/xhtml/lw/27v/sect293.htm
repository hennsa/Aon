<h3>293</h3>

<p>For three hours you ride across the rolling grasslands, guided on your way by your infallible Kai tracking skills and the light of a waxing moon. It is not until you see the outline of a broken stone watchtower silhouetted on the southern horizon that you slow your pace and point your tired mount towards it. Upon reaching the derelict tower you discover that it stands beside a pond of fresh water. You let the horses drink their fill and, as they recover their strength, you and your companions explore the lower levels of the ruin.</p>
<p>The tower is empty and overgrown with weeds. All that it contains are several blocks of stone engraved with ancient designs, which are illuminated by streams of moonlight filtering down through the holes in the shattered roof. You take the opportunity to examine the Claw, and as you unfold its covering blanket on one of the blocks, you find yourself both fascinated and repulsed by the intricacies of its evil design. The head of the Claw resembles a petrified vulture’s foot, cast in a black metal that is flecked with shimmering scarlet specks. Its shaft is twisted, like a length of gnarled root, and it is perforated along its length with pea-sized hollows.</p>
<p>A palpable evil radiates from this dread artefact and you feel an overwhelming compulsion to destroy it. You tell the rangers to stand clear, and then you unsheathe your Kai Weapon and deal the shaft of the Claw a mighty blow.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have picked is even (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0), <a href="sect46.htm">turn to 46</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is odd (i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), <a href="sect122.htm">turn to 122</a>.</p>
