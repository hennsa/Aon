<h3>294</h3>

<p>By twisting the dial of the wall safe to an incorrect setting you unwittingly set off an alarm in a distant barracks guardroom. Suddenly the door to the antechamber is forced open and in burst a dozen soldiers, armed with spears and axes.</p>
<p>You draw your Kai Weapon and fight bravely, slaying most who dare come within a sword’s length, but the chamber is soon awash with reinforcements and ultimately you are forced to drop your weapons and surrender. During the mêlée, the rangers are also captured, and together you are taken before the Sergeant of the Guard. Upon learning of the death of the squad leader, he denounces you as assassins and he orders your immediate execution.</p>
<p>Under heavy guard, you are led out into the centre of the barracks parade ground and tied to wooden stakes. A troop of crossbowmen arrive and form up in a line before you. Then the sergeant marches to the head of their line, and promptly he gives the order to fire. The crossbowmen release their volley of deadly missiles and your deaths are mercifully swift.</p>
<p class="deadend">Tragically, your life and your mission end here, upon the parade ground of the Yua Tzhan barracks.</p>
