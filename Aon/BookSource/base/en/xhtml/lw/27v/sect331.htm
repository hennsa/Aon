<h3>331</h3>

<p>You thread your way through the crush of soldiers and enter the barracks unchallenged. The raised hoods of your robes keep your faces in shadow, and the guards fail to recognize that you are not native Bhanarians.</p>
<p>Beyond the entrance is a courtyard where several wagons, filled with provisions, are being unloaded. You and your companions each take a box from the rear of the nearest wagon and join a line of men who are delivering their goods to a kitchen store room located near the middle of the barracks complex. You leave your boxes here and then return to the courtyard to collect some more. As you are making your way back, you pass a door that your Kai senses tell you is unlocked. Quickly you slip inside and then signal to the rangers to follow. When all of you are safely inside, you shut the door and draw its bolt.</p>
