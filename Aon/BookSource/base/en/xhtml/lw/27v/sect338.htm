<h3>338</h3>

<p>Your refusal angers the Autarch.</p>
<p>You sense a sudden surge of psychic power, and you brace your mental defences in preparation to meet an expected attack. The Autarch launches a stream of psychic pulses but they are not directed at you; Captain Gildas is the target.</p>
<p>Gildas shudders as the pulses impact deep in his mind. His eyes open widely, but his pupils rise to the ceiling. He is in a trance. He draws his sword and, like a mindless automaton, he swings around and comes marching stiffly towards you. You shout his name repeatedly, but all he can hear are the Autarch’s psychic commands to attack and slay you with his sword.</p>
<p>At first his blows are clumsy and easy to dodge, but the speed of his movements increases until you are backed against the chamber wall with nowhere to go. You have no desire to fight Gildas, but he will slay you unwittingly if you do not defend yourself from his relentless blows.</p>
<p class="combat">Captain Gildas <em>(Psychically possessed)</em>: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 48   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 40</p>
<p>Conduct this combat as normal. All blows that you land upon Gildas are with the flat of your blade. You are attempting to subdue him, not kill him. He is immune to all psychic attacks.</p>
<p class="choice">If you win this combat, <a href="sect117.htm">turn to 117</a>.</p>
