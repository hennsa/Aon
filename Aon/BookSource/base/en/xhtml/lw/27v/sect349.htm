<h3>349</h3>

<p>You tell the rangers what you have discovered, and suggest that they rest awhile under the wooden bridge while you attempt to lure a distant group of stallions towards the stream. By the use of your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, you are able to entice four horses to approach the bridge. At first they are nervous, for they can detect the vile stench of the Doomlands’ dust which impregnates the rangers’ tunics, but they are also thirsty and they cannot resist for too long the temptation of the sparkling stream.</p>
<p>You allow them to drink at the stream for several minutes and, as they settle, you slowly approach the leading stallion. You are reaching out to take hold of his mane when he suddenly rises up on his hind legs and flails at you with his hooves.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you possess Grand Huntmastery, add 2 to the number you have picked. If you possess Assimilance, add 1.</p>
<p class="choice">If your total score is now 3 or lower, <a href="sect234.htm">turn to 234</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 4 or higher, <a href="sect99.htm">turn to 99</a>.</p>
