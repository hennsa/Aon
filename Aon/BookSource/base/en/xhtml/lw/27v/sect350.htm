<h3>350</h3>

<p>You see the unmistakable shape of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> silhouetted against the rising sun. It hovers above the central keep of Fort Jhung, and with the wind in your hair and a cry of victory on your lips, you bank your sky-chariot towards it.</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah and Lord Ghadra are among the many on deck who are anxiously watching and praying for you to appear, though no one is expecting your arrival will be by air. The crew can hardly believe their eyes when you bring the sky-chariot down to land upon the deck. Within seconds of touching down, you are surrounded by a mass of cheering countrymen.</p>
<p>Lord Rimoah appears among the excited throng. With tears of joy in his eyes, he embraces you and then offers up a prayer of thanksgiving to Goddess Ishir for your safe return. You deliver to him the Claw of Naar and he vows that this accursed artefact will be destroyed by the Elder Magi to prevent it from ever falling into the hands of Autarch Sejanoz.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. You have met this difficult challenge and you have triumphed. Your brave and daring exploits will long be remembered in the legends of the New Order Kai. Yet the fight against Evil goes on. Soon your courage and Kai skills will be tested anew. The nature of the quest and the dangers that await you will be revealed in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure entitled:</p>
<p><a href="../../lw/28thos/title.htm"><cite>The Hunger of Sejanoz</cite></a></p>
