<h3>41</h3>

<p>You hurry away from the trees and enter the busy stables. Dozens of troopers are grooming their mounts in stalls which are set facing each other. They form a long corridor that runs all the way to a pair of open green doors at the far end of the building. Through this open doorway you glimpse the enticing sight of a city street, and you and your companions have to struggle to overcome an almost overwhelming urge to run headlong towards it.</p>
<p>Most of the horses that are standing in the stalls are saddled-up in preparation for tomorrow’s ceremony. The troopers are part of the mounted guard detailed to escort the Autarch through the city. You whisper to the others to look for some unattended horses, but as you approach the stalls, you are challenged by a suspicious trooper. Roughly you barge him aside and leap into the saddle of a chestnut mare. The rangers are all close behind you when you dig in your heels and urge your mount to gallop along the central corridor that leads to the exit. The troopers wave their fists as you speed past them, and hurriedly two of them attempt to shut the green doors before you can make good your escape into the street.</p>
