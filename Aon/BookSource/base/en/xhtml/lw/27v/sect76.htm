<h3>76</h3>

<p>The old man thanks you for having lifted the curse that was placed upon him by the shape-changer. Your courageous act has not saved his life, but it has saved his soul from the clutches of Naar’s fell servant.</p>
<p>‘I am … Juanphor,’ he says, struggling to speak his name. ‘I am a Chai herbalist … from Zuda. I came to the Vanchou a year ago in search of rare herbs and I fell under the curse of the shape-changer.’</p>
<p>The old man draws from the pocket of his robe a small pouch containing some powdered yellow petals, and a rusty red key. He insists that you keep them, as a gift for your kindness. ‘The powder is Poghlam—it shall protect you from evil,’ he says in a whisper, ‘… and the key will open the door to my home in Zuda. It is called the Crimson Tower. Whatever you wish to take … it is yours.’</p>
<p>You offer to carry the old man away from the forest but he refuses to leave. ‘My days are numbered. I shall only be a burden to you. You must leave me and go. Do not delay … the shape-changer is approaching. I … can feel … her anger.’</p>
<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense confirms that the old man is correct. The shape-changer is approaching the clearing, and you must leave immediately if you are to avoid another deadly confrontation with her.</p>
<p>Reluctantly you bid farewell to this brave old man, and then you cross the clearing hurriedly and remount your horse. Gildas beckons you to follow as he and his rangers make good a hasty escape into the trees.</p>
<p>(If you choose to keep the Poghlam and the Red Key, record them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as Backpack Items.)</p>
