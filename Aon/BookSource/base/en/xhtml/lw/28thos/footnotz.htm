You may decide that you have had a chance after acquiring the Arrow of Atonement to also find a Bow (mark the Bow on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, discarding another Weapon if necessary), that you are still able to use the Arrow of Atonement without a Bow, or that not having a Bow leads to a failure to accomplish your mission.
