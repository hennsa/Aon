<h3>109</h3>

<p>You watch the scouts and their sergeant gallop off along the highway until Chan orders the caravan to continue on its way towards the village. As you pass through this settlement, excited village children begin running alongside the carriage horses. They feed them vegetables and handfuls of straw, and in return the kindly drivers toss them freshly-minted Ren—the currency of Chai.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon the caravan enters a sparsely wooded area. In some places the branches of the surrounding trees form canopies over the highway which provide a welcome respite from the blazing sun. While passing through one of these leafy tunnels, your Kai Sixth Sense alerts you to a hidden danger. You warn Chan and he heeds your advice; fearing an ambush by Kronar’s gang, he sends out an order to his men to be extra vigilant. Nervously, you scan the surrounding trees for a visible sign of danger, yet your keen eyes detect nothing unusual. Then suddenly a cry rings out. You glance over your shoulder and, to your horror, you see three monstrous creatures grappling with the driver of Princess Mitzu’s carriage. They have dropped out of the canopy of branches as her wagon passed beneath their secret hiding place.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, you and Captain Chan turn your horses about and gallop headlong towards the stricken driver. The man is fighting bravely, but his ghoulish attackers have injured him badly and his strength is fading fast. You must act swiftly if you are to save his life and spare Princess Mitzu from these three monstrous ambushers.</p>
