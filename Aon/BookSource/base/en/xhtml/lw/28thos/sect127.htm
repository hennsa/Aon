<h3>127</h3>

<p>You hurry to the carriage and discover Princess Mitzu consoling her young son who is shivering with fright. Chan is nearby, holding a dead serpent by the tail. You swallow hard when you see that it is a scarlet viper, a notoriously poisonous snake. One of Chan’s troopers is being restrained by two of his comrades, and he is pleading his innocence.</p>
<p>‘What is going on?’ you ask.</p>
<p>Chan explains that the Prince disturbed the viper which was asleep under the covers of his cot.</p>
<p>‘He is lucky to be alive,’ says Mitzu, hugging him close. ‘His cries alerted Captain Chan and me, and when we arrived, we found Trooper Yankin inside the carriage. I suspect he is an enemy agent, one of the Autarch’s spies.’</p>
<p>‘I’m not, I swear it!’ retorts the accused man. ‘I was nearby when I heard the Prince scream. I rushed into the carriage to save him. I thought he was being attacked.’</p>
<p>You stare directly into the accused man’s eyes and your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that he may be speaking the truth.</p>
