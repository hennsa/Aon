<h3>166</h3>

<p>When the meal is over, Chan produces a pair of ornate ivory dice from the pocket of his tunic. ‘These are Xi-die,’ he says, and tosses them to you. They feel weighty and their intricate gold designs invite a closer inspection. When you return them to the Captain, he passes them over to one of his men who cups them in his hands and breathes on them. Then, with a quick flick of his wrist, he casts them onto the ground and Chan leans forward to study the result. Cheerfully he informs the man that his future is secure; he and his wife will be blessed with a son and they can look forward to a long and happy life together. You sense at once that Chan’s reading is false: he is simply using the Xi-die as a means of raising the man’s morale.</p>

<p>Once all of Chan’s men have taken their turn to throw the dice and have each received a favourable reading, the captain offers them to you.</p>
<p>‘Would you like to discover what your future has in store, my lord?’ he asks. ‘All will be revealed with one throw of these dice.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to cast the Xi-die, <a href="sect190.htm">turn to 190</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to politely decline the captain’s offer, <a href="sect34.htm">turn to 34</a>.</p>
