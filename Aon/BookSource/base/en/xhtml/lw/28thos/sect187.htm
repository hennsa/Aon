<h3>187</h3>

<p>‘Very well, Grand Master,’ says Chan, a little disappointedly. ‘As you wish. But please excuse me while I go to the armoury myself. The Imperial Caravan will leave shortly from the palace courtyard. I shall meet you there in twenty minutes’ time.’</p>
<p>After bowing respectfully to the Khea-khan, Chan strides out of the throne room and disappears along the corridor beyond. Nearby, a group of silk-robed courtiers are gathering up hundreds of Chai court scrolls and other papers of state. You volunteer to help them place these valuable manuscripts into wickerwork baskets, and then carry them outside to the Imperial Caravan in readiness for the long journey east.</p>
<p>The caravan consists of three large carriages, each drawn by a team of eight horses, plus an escort of twenty Imperial Cavalry troopers clad in plain crimson tunics. The golden ornamentation that once embellished the state carriages has been stripped away, and their fine lacquered sides have been painted a dun brown to camouflage their true origins. You approve of their ordinary appearance for it will be far less likely to attract unwanted attention on the long road ahead.</p>
<p>You are helping to load the baskets of papers into the last of the carriages when Captain Chan arrives, fresh from his visit to the armoury. You notice that he is now wearing a waistcoat of golden mail, called an <i xml:lang="x-chaian">ang’sei</i>, and he is carrying a halberd-like spear called a <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i>. With a deft flick of this fine weapon he motions to a stable guard to bring him his horse—a proud stable stallion. The young guardsman also brings an additional mount, a dappled chestnut mare, and he hands the reins of this horse to you.</p>
<p>‘We’ll ride together, my lord,’ says Chan, as he settles himself into the saddle. You mount your horse, and then together you watch in silence as the aged Khea-khan and his family arrive in the courtyard. Devoted attendants usher them into the middle carriage, and as soon as the doors are closed, Chan gives the signal for the column to move off. Slowly the carriages trundle through the gates of the Imperial Palace and out into the city beyond. You and Chan follow behind the third carriage, and as you ride through the gates, the last sound you hear is the gentle sobbing of the Khea-khan’s palace servants, those he has had to leave behind.</p>
