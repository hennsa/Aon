<h3>190</h3>

<p>You take the dice and breathe on them. Then you toss them to the ground and Chan leans forward, eager to decipher their meaning.</p>
<p>‘You will face many challenges and many battles, my lord,’ he says, thoughtfully, ‘but a glorious victory shall be yours. Yet you must beware the cold. A freezing death is your greatest peril.’</p>
<p>It strikes you as odd that Chan should interpret the dice in this way, and the risk of freezing to death in the middle of summer seems a remote possibility. But you accept his reading in good spirit and he is pleased by your favourable reaction. He offers the Xi-die to you as a present, a token of his respect for your reputation and your innate Kai skills.</p>
<p>If you wish to accept Chan’s gift, record the Xi-die on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item that you keep in the pocket of your tunic. You need not discard another Special Item if you already hold the maximum number permissible.</p>
