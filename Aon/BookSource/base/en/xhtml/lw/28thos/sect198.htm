<h3>198</h3>

<p>The scouting party has captured a bandit. The man is unconscious, and his face is smeared with blood that is trickling freely from a wound to his scalp. Captain Chan orders a soldier to throw a pail of cold spring water over the prisoner, but this fails to revive him.</p>
<p>You approach the man and use your Kai healing skills in an attempt to restore him to consciousness. A small circle of curious courtiers gather to watch, and they gasp with amazement when he suddenly awakes with a start. With fear-filled eyes, the man returns the stares of his captors and begins to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>Sergeant Yeng slaps his face with the back of his calloused hand and demands that he identify himself. Immediately, the bandit clamps his jaw shut and refuses to utter another sound. You use your psychic skills to probe his mind and discover that he is unusually strong-willed and resilient. You sense that he would be unlikely to break under torture.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use it, <a href="sect80.htm">turn to 80</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess Kai-surge and wish to use it, <a href="sect231.htm">turn to 231</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess neither of these skills, or if you decide not to use them, <a href="sect13.htm">turn to 13</a>.</p>
