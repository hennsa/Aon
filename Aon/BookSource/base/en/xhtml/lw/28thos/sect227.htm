<h3>227</h3>

<p>You are awoken shortly before dawn by a shrill cock’s crow. You rise swiftly, gather up your equipment, and then hurry to the courtyard where you meet with Captain Chan outside the stable door. Some of his troopers are busy replenishing the caravan’s stores of food and fresh water, and others are preparing the horse teams for the long road ahead. Madame Omaki’s servants are also in attendance, bearing wooden platters stacked with food. You and Chan help yourselves to this delicious breakfast fare as you discuss the journey that lies ahead. The sky is clear and Chan is confident that you shall make good progress, just so long as you do not run foul of Bhanarian scouts. (There is a surplus of food, enough for 2 Meals. Remember to adjust your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> accordingly if you decide to take any.)</p>
<p>As planned, within an hour of daybreak, the caravan is on the road once more. You depart from Javai by way of its east gate, and begin the four-day journey to your next destination—the tented city of Rakholi.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If the number you have chosen is 0–4, <a href="sect194.htm">turn to 194</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is 5–9, <a href="sect88.htm">turn to 88</a>.</p>
