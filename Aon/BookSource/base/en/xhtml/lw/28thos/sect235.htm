<h3>235</h3>

<p>You shudder with dread when you look upon the ghastly hulking forms of the two creatures standing before you now. At first glance they seem to resemble the Baknars that roam the frozen wastes of Kalte, with their thick white fur and ridged horns. But you sense that these creatures are not of any natural origin, but are born of vile sorcery. Their eyes glow with a malevolent light and they exhale plumes of icy breath that freeze everything they touch.</p>
<p>You look east along the highway for a way to escape from these beasts, but when you magnify your vision, you see that the road is blocked by a great hill of snow and ice. The surrounding pines are too dense to attempt swift escape on horseback, and you slowly begin to realize that these creatures have you trapped.</p>
<p>Chan draws his <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i> and levels it at the ice-beasts. ‘Let’s run these cold-hearts down!’ he shouts, with great bravado. ‘One swift charge and we’ll be out of this frigid woodland before they know what’s hit them.’</p>
<p class="choice">If you agree to Chan’s plan of action, <a href="sect211.htm">turn to 211</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you disagree with his plan, <a href="sect146.htm">turn to 146</a>.</p>
