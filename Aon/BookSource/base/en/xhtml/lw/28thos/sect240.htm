<h3>240</h3>

<p>Cowering in the corner of this dingy candlelit cell, you see a ragged old man dressed in grimy grey robes. He is the source of the foul odour that threatens to suffocate you. When he sees you, his dirt-encrusted face cracks into the parody of a smile and he waves his hands excitedly in the air.</p>
<p>‘My, my, a Kai Lord! I’m truly honoured to have you visit, sir. But I see my odour offends you. Wait, I shall soon remedy that.’ And with these words he produces a pinch of grey powder from his pocket and casts it into the air. Instantly the vile smell is transformed into the wonderful bouquet of fresh roses. You ask the old man how he came to be trapped here, and he recounts the calamities that have befallen him. You learn that his name is Vannar and that he is a lowly magician. He was born in Bhanar but was forced to leave when he attempted to organize opposition to Autarch Sejanoz in his home city of Yua Tzhan. He became a hermit and eked out a solitary existence here in the ruins of Zanaza. His life was lonely but peaceful, until the tomb robbers arrived one day and took over his underground retreat. The vile smell that he exuded earlier was the only way he had of keeping those cut-throats at bay.</p>
<p>When you tell him that the Autarch has invaded Chai, he becomes agitated. He fears that he will be found and murdered by Sejanoz’s agents.</p>
<p>‘With respect, Vannar,’ you say, ‘I don’t think the Autarch will bother sending his men after you.’</p>
<p>‘Oh yes he will,’ replies the grimy old magician, in a deadly serious tone. ‘And you would believe what I say if you knew what I possess, Sir Kai.’</p>
