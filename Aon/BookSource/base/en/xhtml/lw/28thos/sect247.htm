<h3>247</h3>

<p>You wake at first light and breakfast with Chan. He is surprised to see your Kai Weapon scabbarded at your side, and he asks how you came to retrieve it. You tell him that you happened upon the robbers by chance last night, and merely asked the good fellows to return it. Chan laughs when he hears this. ‘Well, we’ll not be seeing any more from those fine fellows again, I dare say,’ he says, and a wry smile spreads across his wide face.</p>
<p>The caravan leaves Zanaza within the hour, and as it follows the stony road east towards Fort Vlau, you note a battered signpost which states that the Lissanian stronghold lies 150 miles away. Chan estimates the journey will take four days.</p>
<p>The first day of the journey passes uneventfully, but around noon of the second you see the highway approaching a distant forest. Your Sixth Sense gives you a premonition of danger, and when you tell Chan of your concerns, he halts the caravan and insists that the two of you scout the forest to make sure it is safe to pass through.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ride along the highway and into the forest, <a href="sect114.htm">turn to 114</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to leave the highway and approach the forest by way of the plains, <a href="sect205.htm">turn to 205</a>.</p>
