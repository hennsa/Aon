<h3>288</h3>

<p>You are awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of a fearful scream. You unsheathe your Kai Weapon and leap to your feet, and as your night vision adjusts to the darkness, you see movement out of the corner of your eye. One of the troopers standing guard duty at the edge of the camp is struggling with a large worm-like creature that has emerged from one of the bore holes. His desperate cries have alerted the other guards, and they are picking their way slowly across the treacherous ground to go to his aid. You also respond to his cries, but as you are skirting around the rim of one large fissure, suddenly another of the worm-like monstrosities rears up from this hole and spits at you. Your skin crawls when your Kai senses detect that this creature’s saliva is a highly corrosive alkaline.</p>
