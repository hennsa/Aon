<h3>300</h3>

<p>The Bhanarian army outside Fort Vlau turns and flees in disarray upon discovering that their leader has been destroyed, for they believed him to be immortal and invincible. The way is now open for the caravan to reach Tazhan unhindered, and upon your arrival there, you discover that the news of Autarch Sejanoz’s demise has already spread the length and breadth of Southern Magnamund. The Khea-khan is able to rally the New Kingdom armies and sweep the shattered remnants of the Bhanarian armies back into their own lands and beyond.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Grand Master. Your victory is total. You have rid this continent and its people of a cruel tyrant who has threatened their peaceful existence for many centuries, and your triumph here is set to become legend. In future times the chronicle will tell of other quests that you undertook on the road to becoming a Kai Supreme Master. Until the time comes for their telling, may the Gods Ishir and Kai watch over you, always.</p>
