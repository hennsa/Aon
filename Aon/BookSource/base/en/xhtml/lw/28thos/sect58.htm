<h3>58</h3>

<p>The dusty streets of Pensei are filled with the din of coarse shouting, the smells of sweat and spices, and the anxious murmurings of a populace living in fear of the Bhanarian invaders. Your heart goes out to the citizens of this proud city and you pray to Ishir to help them keep the enemy at bay. Upon arriving at the great north gate of Pensei, the column passes beneath its crenellated arch and out onto the plains road beyond. As the gate crashes shut behind you, you notice a stone marker by the wayside. It indicates the distance to the next town: Javai—100 miles.</p>
<p>Captain Chan calculates that it may take nearly three days to reach Javai. Fearful that the vanguard of the Autarch’s army may find the caravan on the open road and threaten its precious cargo, he orders his troopers to take up positions around the column in order to shield it. You are impressed by the speed and efficiency with which they carry out his orders, and you feel greatly reassured that you are in the company of highly-trained warriors. They will be useful allies if the need should ever arise to repel an enemy attack.</p>
<p>Once you are beyond the outskirts of Pensei, the villages pass by with less frequency the further you travel north along this broad trade road. At dusk, you stop to set up a night camp on a hill which overlooks a small hamlet called Xiostai. Captain Chan posts pickets to patrol the camp perimeter, and details some of the remaining men to guard the Khea-khan’s carriage. You are invited to share a meal of rice and fish with Chan and some of the carriage drivers, and you accept their hospitality gladly. While you are eating you listen to their jovial conversations and learn something about the Chai people that you never knew before. The majority of them have a keen interest in astrology.</p>
