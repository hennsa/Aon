<h3>9</h3>

<p>The fight comes to an abrupt end when you deal the last living creature a mighty blow to the base of its deformed head. As it falls lifelessly to the ground, Sergeant Yeng rushes to check that his men have also survived intact. Cautiously you inspect the bodies of the slain beasts and quickly determine that all three are of Agarashi descent. They have probably come down from the Hyunsei foothills in a desperate search for prey, for the corpses are emaciated by hunger. Sergeant Yeng confirms your suspicions. He tells you that long ago, during the Age of Eternal Night, this land was stalked by Agarashi—the hellish creations of Agarash the Damned. When Agarash was destroyed by the Elder Magi, his creations were scattered across the wilderness and plains of Chai. The descendants of these beasts are still alive today, hiding in hills, burrows, and caves. They do not usually attack travellers unless driven by disease or famine.</p>
<p>Using your tracking skills, you quickly determine that there are no other creatures like these in this vicinity. Only then do you and the troopers remount your horses and continue along the highway towards the Javai Forest. A few miles short of the forest you discover a freshwater spring which is forded by the highway. It is an ideal site for a night camp, and so you send one of Yeng’s men back to the caravan to tell them that you shall await their arrival here.</p>
<p>During your wait for the caravan, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<p class="choice">To continue, <a href="sect45.htm">turn to 45</a>.</p>
