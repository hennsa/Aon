       <a id="nodispln">New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines</a>
      </h4>
      <p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor&mdash;Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf&mdash;you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>
      <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.  Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from God Kai many new skills and abilities, including the powers of Astrology, Herbmastery, Elementalism, and Bardsmanship. He perfected these with the help of his allies in Lyris, Bautar, and Dessi, and established them as new disciplines to be taught to the betterment of the New Order Kai.</p>
      <p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>

       <img alt="illustration" class="img-responsive" src="wpnmast.png"></figure>
      <p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which you begin the <cite>New Order</cite> series, means that you are skilled in the use of <em>one</em> of the weapons listed below.</p>

      <p>For every adventure that you complete successfully in the <cite>New Order</cite> series while possessing the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery, you will gain proficiency with one additional weapon.</p>
      <p>If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 5 points to any number you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow.</p>
      <h5>

      </h5>
      <figure>
       <img alt="illustration" class="img-responsive" src="delvrance.png"></figure>
      <p>New Order Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle-wounds. If, while in combat, their <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. This emergency ability can only be used once every 20 days.</p>
      <h5>

      <p>New Order Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and they possess great natural speed and agility. They also have a superb sense of touch and taste.

      <figure>
       <img alt="illustration" class="img-responsive" src="ksurge.png"></figure>
      <p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, New Order Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> without loss of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points (Kai-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously). New Order Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> score falls to 6 points or below.</p>

       <img alt="illustration" class="img-responsive" src="telegnss.png"></figure>

      <h5>
       <a id="magi">Magi-magic <em>(Old Kingdom Magic)</em></a>
      </h5>
