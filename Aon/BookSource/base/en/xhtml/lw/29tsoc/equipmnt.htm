      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>When you begin this adventure, you have in your possession a <a href="map.htm">map of the Khea-Khanate of Chai</a> which also depicts areas of the neighbouring territories of Bhanar and the Great Lissan Plain.Additionally, you possess a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the &lsquo;Gold Crowns&rsquo; section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>If you have successfully completed previous <cite>New Order</cite> adventures (Books 21&ndash;28), you may add this sum to the number of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-1-foot" id="equipmnt-1">3</a></sup>

      <h4>
       <a id="kaiweapn">Kai Weapons</a>
      </h4>
      <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the &eacute;lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>
      <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a href="action.htm">Special Items List</a>.<sup><a href="#equipmnt-2-foot" id="equipmnt-2">4</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe &lsquo;Alema&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>
      <p>
       <strong>Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>If you were to use &lsquo;Alema&rsquo; in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of +7 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> would remain at +5.</p>

       <dd>The maximum number of Weapons that you can carry is <em>two</em>. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct Weapon, it adds 5 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.

        <br>

       <dt>Bows and Arrows</dt>
       <dd>During your adventure there will be opportunities to use a Bow and Arrow. If you equip yourself with this Weapon, and you possess at least one Arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The Bow is a useful Weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a Bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat; therefore it is advisable that you also equip yourself with a close combat Weapon, such as a Sword or an Axe.<br>
        <br>In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.<br>

       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br>
        <br>Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (e.g. Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item.

       </dd>
       <dt>Kai Weapon</dt>
       <dd>Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal Weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. This is in addition to the bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.<br>

       <dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your five Disciplines, then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br>

It cannot be used to increase <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br>

They occupy less space in your Belt Pouch and therefore you can carry more of them. The national currency of Chai is the Ren. In some of the larger towns and cities of Chai, Gold Crowns are readily accepted alongside the local currency. However, this is less likely to be the case in rural areas of the country. Before you begin your adventure, you may exchange some of your Gold Crowns for Ren at the rate of 1 Gold Crown = 10 Ren. Use the following currency table to calculate the mixed currency capacity of your belt pouch:</p>
        <ul class="unbulleted">
         <li>1 Gold Crown = 4 Silver Lune</li>
         <li>1 Gold Crown = 10 Kika</li>
         <li>1 Gold Crown = 1 Noble</li>
         <li>1 Gold Crown = 10 Ren</li>
         <li>1 Gold Crown = 4 Sheasu Torq</li>
         <li>1 Gold Crown = 2 Orla</li>
