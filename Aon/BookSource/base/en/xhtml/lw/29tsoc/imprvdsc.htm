      <h3>Improved Grand Master Disciplines</h3>
      <p>Supreme Master Lone Wolf&rsquo;s enhanced and accelerated training ensures each New Order Grand Master, like you, learns five basic New Order Grand Master Disciplines to achieve the rank and status of a Grand Master Senior. Beyond this rank, as you rise through the higher levels of Kai Grand Mastery, you will discover that your Disciplines will steadily improve.</p>
      <h4>
       <a id="superior">Kai Grand Master Superior</a>
      </h4>
      <p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
      <dl>
       <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Assimilance</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy&rsquo;s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Astrology</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.<br>

       </dd>
       <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption.

        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Elementalism</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge.

        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>

      <dl>
       <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are, when physically parted from their Kai Weapon, able to detect its location.

       </dd>
       <dt>Astrology</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to detect psychic residues left on an object by its owner.

        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Herbmastery</dt>

       </dd>
       <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>

       </dd>

       <dd>Kai Grand Defenders who possess this Discipline are able to neutralize any poisonous toxins that may be present in organic materials such as plants, berries, and fruits. Through the use of this skill, the transformation of toxins can sometimes result in an increase in <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> and/or <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> when the previously poisonous matter is swallowed.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Elementalism</dt>
       <dd>By using this Discipline, Kai Grand Defenders are able to summon up a dense, misty vapour to obscure themselves from both normal vision and infravision (night sight). This mist will occur within 5 feet of the Kai Grand Defender and will last for three to five minutes. Range and duration increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Defenders who possess this Discipline are able to use their musical skills to pacify (and/or implant a suggestion into the mind of) an intelligent creature within audible range.

      <dl>
       <dt>Assimilance</dt>

       </dd>
       <dt>Herbmastery</dt>

       <dd>Through the use of this Discipline, Kai Grand Guardians are able to protect themselves from the effects of storm-force winds by creating a sphere of calm air around their bodies.

       </dd>
       <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
       <dd>Kai Grand Guardians with this skill enjoy increased mobility when travelling across all types of terrain, whether on foot or on horseback. This improved ability can be very useful when used to outdistance a pursuing enemy.<br>

       <dd>Kai Grand Guardians who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to attack up to three enemies in psychic combat simultaneously.<br>

       </dd>
       <dt>Kai-screen</dt>

        <br>
        <ul>
         <li>

         <li>
          <i>Flameshaft</i>&mdash;This causes the tip of any Arrow, or Arrow-like missile, to burn fiercely with a magical flame which cannot readily be extinguished by normal means.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>

       </dd>
       <dt>Deliverance</dt>
       <dd>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature&rsquo;s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing process takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
       <dd>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
       <dd>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state, the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.<br>

       </dd>
       <dt>Astrology</dt>

       <dd>Sun Knights who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to use their musical skills to launch sonic attacks against any individual within audible range.

        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
       <dd>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <i>Halt Missile</i>&mdash;This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2&ndash;3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight time in which to move away from the missile&rsquo;s line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
         <li>
          <i>Strength</i>&mdash;By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>

      <p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Sun Lord, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
      <dl>
       <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
       <dd>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a Weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden Weapon such as a Quarterstaff.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
       <dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to cause living plants, e.g. grasses, bushes, flowers, weeds, rushes, to entwine themselves around the limbs of hostile creatures, thereby hampering their free movement. Sun Lords are able to target only one creature in this way. An additional creature can be affected for every level a Grand Master rises above the rank of Sun Lord.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Assimilance</dt>
       <dd>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.<br>

       <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
       <dd>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see the complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
       <dd>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast&mdash;a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a &lsquo;0&rsquo; = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord&rsquo;s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
       <dd>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration&mdash;and degree of surface difficulty&mdash;increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br>

       </dd>
       <dt>Magi-magic</dt>

        <br>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <i>Penetrate</i>&mdash;This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow, or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
         <li>
          <i>Energy Grasp</i>&mdash;This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <i>Lightning Hand</i>. It differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or enemy to effect the spell.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
       <dd>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to direct their musical abilities to disrupt the structure of inanimate breakable objects, e.g. glass, ceramics, urns, flasks, causing them to explode violently.

      <dl>
       <dt>Astrology</dt>
       <dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are expert in the art of hypnotism. By the use of a hypnotic stare, they are able to cause susceptible creatures (up to three individuals at any one time) willingly to carry out their orders. The number of creatures so affected&mdash;and the duration of the effect&mdash;increases steadily as a Sun Thane advances in Kai rank.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
       <dd>Sun Thanes with this Discipline are able to command an animal to fall asleep at will. Some hostile animals may be able to resist this command; however most will be affected by it in some way. The duration of effect and the number of animals which can be affected at one time will increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br>

       </dd>
       <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
       <dd>Kai Sun Thanes with this skill are able to protect themselves from the effects of being struck by natural electrical discharges, i.e. lightning.<br>

       <dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to accelerate greatly the oxidation (rusting) of ferrous metals simply by touch alone. The longer the metallic item is touched by a Sun Thane, the more damaging will be the effect.<br>

       <dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
       <dd>Sun Thanes who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to alter the temperature of water by touch. By using this skill they are able to transform water into ice and vice versa. The volume of water affected and the duration of effect both increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.<br>
        <br>
       </dd>
       <dt>Kai-screen</dt>
       <dd>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to erect a special psychic defence called <i>Mindfort</i>. A <i>Mindfort</i> defence greatly reduces the effects of any psychic shock that would normally paralyse or weaken a lesser mortal.<br>

       <dd>Grand Thanes are able to absorb and transform hostile psychic energy into a positive physical effect. Using this powerful ability, a Grand Thane can restore lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points while being subjected to psychic attack. The number and rate of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points regained in this way varies greatly, and is dependent upon the nature of the attack and the physical condition of the Grand Thane when the attack occurs.<br>
