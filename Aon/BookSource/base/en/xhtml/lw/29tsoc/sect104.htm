      <h3>104</h3>
      <p>Elder Qinlau sees to it that your horses are stabled here at Militia Headquarters. Meanwhile, Captain Xing writes two notes informing his militia sergeants that you and Lieutenant Quang are authorised to take command of their companies. Then he hurries away to the bell tower and rings the bell. It warns the townsfolk that Vabou is in imminent danger of attack and it calls the militia to their battle posts at the watchtowers and along the perimeter walls.</p>
      <p>A small group of boys gather at the Militia headquarters. They are messengers who are charged with conveying written orders from Captain Xing to the militiamen. They will also carry reports back from the palisade wall to keep the Captain abreast of any changes in the situation. One of the boys is ordered to take you to the West Watchtower. Another is assigned to Lieutenant Quang and the Watchers who will go to the North Watchtower. As the boys are collecting the notes that Captain Xing has written, Quang and the Watchers bid you good luck and good hunting. You agree to meet back here after the battle, assuming the fight goes in your favour.</p>
      <p>The messenger boy escorts through the teeming rain to the West Watchtower. When you arrive, he hands Captain Xing&rsquo;s note to the sergeant in command of the men stationed here. The man&rsquo;s eyes widen with surprise the moment he reads the note and realises who you are: the Slayer of Sejanoz! You instruct him to show you the watchtower and adjoining walls so that you can best deploy his company of militiamen. With pride, he takes you into the tower and up a wooden staircase that leads to the parapet walkway. You order five militiamen to man the tower and deploy the others along the palisade wall. As they hurry to get in position, you see some of the enemy horde approaching the north wall through the sheeting rain. As they come closer, your heart sinks. These Skarada are being led by six Chagarashi. In unison, the snarling horrors throw back their heads and let loose a chorus of bloodcurdling shrieks; it is the signal to attack!</p>
