      <h3>106</h3>
      <p>The graceful courtier leaves the hall and returns a few minutes later bearing a golden tray laden with refreshments. She pours tea from a silver pot into two porcelain cups and offers them to you and the Captain. Gratefully you accept her hospitality and sip the delicious beverage while you peruse the many fine portraits and paintings displayed in the hall. One canvas in particular catches your eye for you are one of three subjects portrayed in it.</p>
      <p>The painting depicts the fall of Autarch Sejanoz. The setting is a darkened chamber heaped with rubble and earth. Light pours down through a ragged hole in the ceiling, illuminating the evil tyrant who is shown on his knees at the left of the composition. The magical Arrow of Atonement is embedded deep in his chest and, through the grill of his tiger helm, his eyes blaze with anger and agony. A small boy, young Prince Kamada, is shown in the foreground running towards the sanctuary of your outstretched arms. You are positioned on the right of the painting and you are pleased to see that you have been depicted with some fair degree of accuracy. The artist has captured your hair and facial features well, but he has exercised a degree of license by showing you clad in overly ornate Kai battle dress and not the plain blue padded tunic and breeches that you were wearing at the time. The Bow with which you fired the fateful Arrow into the Autarch&rsquo;s heart lies discarded on the ground at your feet.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;My compliments, Grand Master,&rsquo; says Captain Voushan, with deep respect. &lsquo;The likeness is uncanny. You have barely aged at all since this painting was commissioned. If memory serves, I believe it was first hung in the throne room 17 years ago.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re too kind,&rsquo; you reply with a smile, and say no more than this. You refrain from telling the Captain that you owe your preservation to your diligent exercise and development of your innate Grand Master Disciplines. Since you became a Kai Grand Master, your body has aged at a much slower rate than men less gifted than you. For every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
      <p>A fanfare of trumpets sounds in the concourse, announcing Lin Tao&rsquo;s return to the Pensei Pagoda. You return to the middle of the throne room and place your empty tea cup on the golden tray. As you straighten up, the young Khea-khan comes striding into chamber with his personal bodyguard, Lieutenant Quang, following close behind. He is clad in golden armour and is wearing his <i xml:lang="x-chaian">Hoguan</i>, his imperial crown.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Greetings, Grand Master,&rsquo; he says, with a youthful yet confident voice. &lsquo;We are humbled to finally meet the Slayer of Sejanoz. We forever owe you a debt of gratitude for ridding us of the unholy Autarch.&rsquo; Lao Tin pauses to instruct his bodyguard to bring the Watchers to the throne room then he mounts his throne and motions to you and Captain Voushan to approach the marble plinth.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;We have been informed of your reason for coming to Pensei. We are in accord with your desire to convey the Eye of Agarash to the Elder Magi, and we shall assist you as best we can.&rsquo; You are impressed by the candour of this young Khea-khan. He has the proud mien of his illustrious forbears and you sense that he will become an exceptional leader, given time and good fortune. Lao Tin removes a small leather satchel that hangs by a strap from his shoulder. He offers it to you and you lean forward with your hand outstretched to accept it.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you possess Kai-screen, <a href="sect275.htm">turn to 275</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you do not possess this Grand Master Discipline, <a href="sect46.htm">turn to 46</a>.</p>
