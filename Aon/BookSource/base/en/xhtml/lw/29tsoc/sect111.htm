      <p>It is still dark when Quang wakes you up. The glowing embers of the campfire illuminate the interior of the shelter with a dull amber light by which you and the Watchers are able to gather your equipment and make ready to leave.</p>
      <p>Bai and Chao venture outside and go forage for some edible foliage with which to feed the horses. There are plentiful puddles of rainwater and Quang makes sure the horses drink their fill before Bai and Chao return. Dawn has broken by the time the horses have finished feeding and you mount up and begin your woodland journey to the village of Jueng.</p>
      <p>It is mid-morning when you happen upon an old hunting track. It is mostly overgrown with foliage, but it provides you with a south-easterly route through the forest which is easy to follow. The rain stops and your woodland ride is blessedly uneventful. The forest is rich with berries, nuts, and edible flora that are sufficient to sustain you and your companions throughout the day. Shortly before dusk you come to a wide and muddy highway. Bai and Chao recognize this road at once for it connects the town of Klatii with the village of Jueng. They have travelled this highway many times in their youth. Bai, who was born and raised in Klatii, remembers that there was an old woodsman&rsquo;s hut near here, just a mile or two to the south in the direction of Jueng. He leads you to it and you spend the night here before setting off to Jueng at first light.</p>
