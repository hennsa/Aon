      <h3>127</h3>
      <p>Two Imperial Guardsmen clad in <i xml:lang="x-chaian">ang&rsquo;sei</i> (the famous Chai waistcoats of golden mail) who are posted at the gates of the Imperial Palace Keep come smartly to attention and salute Captain Voushan as you approach. He acknowledges their salute and you accompany the Captain into the courtyard beyond. The largest building in this exclusive area is the Pensei Pagoda. It is also the oldest and most impressive construction in all of Chai, dating back to the time when the country was first established following the collapse of the Vaduzhan Empire during the Great Civil War of MS&nbsp;1620.</p>
      <p>Upon entering the main concourse of the Pensei Pagoda, you are struck by the lavishness of the interior which recently has been renovated at Khea-khan Lao Tin&rsquo;s behest. Its panelled walls and ornamented arched doors are exquisitely carved with symbols of historic and religious significance, delicately inlaid with fine gold leaf and myriad pearls. There is an impressive circular skywell positioned above an elegant indoor garden that harbours several dozen miniature trees, all meticulously cultivated and beautifully arranged around a narrow winding stream of shimmering azure water. A grand mahogany staircase dominates the north side of the concourse and ascends to the first storey. It is here that the Grand Throne Room of the Khea-khan is located.</p>
      <p>The arched door opens as you reach the top of the staircase and Captain Voushan escorts you into the luxuriously appointed chamber beyond. Every inch of the walls and ceiling are embellished with intricate carvings clad with gold leaf. The effect is dazzling at first sight. Portraits of past Khea-khans and depictions of significant events in Chai&rsquo;s proud history are displayed around the walls, and in the centre of the chamber there is a grand ebony throne set atop a large rectangular slab of crimson-veined marble. You inspect the throne and you are disappointed to discover that the Eye of Agarash is missing. There is a deep indentation where the gem was mounted. Tell-tale gouges around this indentation reveal that the gem has recently been prised out of its setting.</p>
      <p>A robed courtier approaches Captain Voushan and informs him that the Khea-khan is inspecting the west wall defences. He is expected to return within the hour and she invites you to await him here.</p>
