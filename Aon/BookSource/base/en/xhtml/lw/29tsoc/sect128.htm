      <h3>128</h3>
      <p>Rakhi gives a sudden squeal of delight and points at the pocket of your jacket.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;You have the Queen!&rsquo; she says, excitedly. You draw the playing piece from your pocket and Rakhi begs you to let her look at it. With trembling fingers she examines it closely.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp; it&rsquo;s the missing piece I&rsquo;ve been looking for!&rsquo; she gasps.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s so special about this samor piece?&rsquo; you ask, somewhat bemused by her passionate reaction.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Wait here, I need to fetch something. I&rsquo;ll not be long.&rsquo; She returns the Samor Queen to you and leaves the table. You watch her hurry across the taproom and disappear through the curtained archway. In less than a minute she returns clutching a mahogany box inlaid with intricate gold designs.</p>
      <p>Proudly, she raises the lid revealing a set of beautifully carved samor pieces, each one resting in its own velvet-lined partition. One piece is missing from the set&mdash;the Samor Queen.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;I lost the Queen over a year ago, and I&rsquo;ve been searching for it ever since to restore my set. This was a present from my late grandmother. She taught me how to play samor when I was a child. I&rsquo;m not wealthy and I cannot offer you much money for the Queen, but I have something of value that may interest you. Perhaps we can make a deal?&rsquo;</p>
      <p>She clutches a small scarlet gem that is strung around her throat on a fine gold chain. She unhooks its clasp and passes it to you.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;It belonged to my mother,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;She gave it to me when I joined the troupe. It has magical properties that have kept me safe since I left Durwan, but I&rsquo;d happily exchange it for the Samor Queen.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You examine the gem closely and your Sixth Sense reveals that it does indeed have magical properties. It is a Wardstone, one of many such artefacts that were created by the Elder Magi millennia ago. It is imbued with the power to weaken undead creatures.</p>
      <p>You agree to Rakhi&rsquo;s proposal and exchange the Samor Queen for her Wardstone. You may record this Wardstone on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item that you wear around your neck, suspended by its gold chain. If you enter into combat against an undead adversary whilst in possession of this item, you may reduce your enemy&rsquo;s <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 3 for the duration of the fight.</p>
      <p>Rakhi is delighted. She places the missing Queen into the empty partition of the box and closes the lid.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Thank you so much. This means so much to me!&rsquo; she says. Then she leans across the table and kisses you fondly on the cheek. It is at this moment that Anseng arrives, having just completed his long conversation with the innkeeper.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;I see you&rsquo;ve found a new friend while I&rsquo;ve been gone,&rsquo; he says, with a wry smile, &lsquo;and I must admit, she&rsquo;s a lot prettier than me.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Rakhi giggles and bids you both goodnight. She leaves the table and Anseng sits himself opposite you. You ask him about his negotiations with the innkeeper and he nods his head wearily.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Lun-chow drives a hard bargain,&rsquo; he replies, &lsquo;but we have ourselves two new horses. I had to pay him every Ren I possessed to get them. Don&rsquo;t worry, my Lord. The Khea-khan is a generous man and he will recompense me once we reach Pensei.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You pour the last of the Senara Tea into your cup and offer it to your guide. He accepts it gladly and swallows it down in one go. Revived by the tea, he tells you that two rooms for the night were part of the bargain he struck with Lun-chow. He hands you a key and tells you that your room is number 5.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;We have another long ride ahead of us tomorrow. Let&rsquo;s get some rest, for we must leave at dawn if we are to reach Pensei by nightfall.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Together you leave the booth and pass through the curtained archway. Both of your rooms are located on the ground floor, next to each other. Anseng wishes you a good night&rsquo;s sleep before retiring to his room, number 4.</p>
