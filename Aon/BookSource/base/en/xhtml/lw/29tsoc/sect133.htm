      <h3>133</h3>
      <p>You wake shortly before dawn and stretch your weary limbs. Quang gets to his feet and awakens each of the snoring Watchers. A daunting ride awaits you all. You have two days in which to cover the 120 miles between Vabou and the location of the lost tracker gem. Mindful that every hour counts, you forego breakfast and mount your horses. In the grey light of dawn, the old highway that bisects the town is busy with townsfolk preparing to leave Vabou while they still can. They are afraid that the enemy will return and have decided to abandon their homes and journey to the distant town of Hi&rsquo;joi. It is located south-east of Vabou, on the eastern side of the mighty River Tkukoma. They believe that they will find safe sanctuary there.</p>
      <p>The rain has eased off overnight to be replaced by a light drizzle. It makes your journey less miserable than it has been since you first arrived in Chai four days ago. The first nineteen miles of your ride towards the village of Zang pass uneventfully. It is not until you approach your twentieth mile on the highway that your Sixth Sense warns you enemies are close. You signal to the others to stop. You stand in the stirrups and scan the surrounding countryside, but all you can see is rain-swept grassland swaying in the wind. There are no signs of the Skarada and Chagarashi that attacked Vabou last night. Satisfied that there appears to be no threat of ambush, you resume the ride towards your rendezvous point. It is not until you are twenty five miles from Vabou that the situation takes a turn for the worse.</p>
      <p>A large group of creatures are spotted in the distance. You magnify your vision and see that they are the survivors of last night&rsquo;s attack. They are blocking the highway and are spread out on either side for half a mile in both directions. You call your companions to a halt and consider the best way to avoid them. Quang suggests you try to circle around to the south, across the Huzang Plain. Bai suggests you may stand a better chance if you enter the foothills of the Szuchow Range to the north and use the cover they provide to get around them that way. Both routes will delay your journey to the rendezvous point significantly. Moreover, you&rsquo;ll not be able to reach Zang before nightfall and will face having to spend a night in the open in enemy occupied territory.</p>
