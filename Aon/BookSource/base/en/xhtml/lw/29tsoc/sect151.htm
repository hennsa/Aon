      <h3>151</h3>
      <p>Priestess Song Tao leads you to an alcove behind the altar and traces her fingertip around one of the engravings on the wall. It activates a secret panel which slides open to reveal a spiral stone staircase. You follow as she climbs to a landing near the top of the tower. A silver-plated door stands before you. Song Tao knocks on this shining door before opening it.</p>
      <p>You follow her into a large and impressive circular chamber. Its smooth walls and ceiling are midnight blue in colour and studded with clusters of tiny Caronese crystals. The effect is stunning; it is as if you have just stepped into deep space and are surrounded by thousands of tiny twinkling stars. The chamber is dimly lit by an oil lamp resting on a circular table in the middle of the room. Song Tao raises its wick and the light becomes brighter. It illuminates three people who are seated in winged armchairs on the far side of the chamber. They stand up and Song Tao introduces them to you.</p>
      <p>The first is Lord Honos, a journeymage from Dessi. The second is Zautro, a curate Herbwarden from Bautar, and the third is Captain Jian Tzu, the commander of Dwala&rsquo;s City Guard. He is also the leader of the Watchers and a loyal friend and ally to the Elder Magi. It was Jian Tzu who sent Anseng to meet you on your arrival in Chai and to be your guide. When you tell them what has happened since your arrival in Chai, they are relieved to see you still have the Eye of Agarash safely in your possession. They are also shocked and saddened to learn of the regrettable loss of Anseng, Chao, and Lieutenant Quang. Lord Honos assures you that their sacrifice will not be in vain, and neither will it be forgotten. Zautro the Herbwarden steps forward and asks to see the Eye of Agarash. The others, too, are anxious to view this infamous artefact and they gather round.</p>
      <p>When you open the leather satchel, you are assailed by a wave of evil energy that drains you of 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you have survived this sudden energy drain, <a href="sect309.htm">turn to 309</a>.</p>
