      <h3>163</h3>
      <p>You draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Curing and transfer the healing warmth of your Kai Discipline into the body of the dying man. His weak pulse strengthens and his muscles twitch involuntarily, but he does not regain consciousness. Then his heart stops beating and he slips away into the merciful embrace of death. You were unable to save his life but your effort was not entirely in vain, for his passing was without pain. Now your mind is flooded with unanswered questions. Why was he savagely murdered? What kind of beast is capable of such cold-bloodied slaughter? Where is Anseng? Is he still alive or has he, too, met a grisly end?</p>
      <p>Galvanised into action by what has happened here, you race down the stairs and mount your horse. Quickly you bring her around to face the open doors and ride out into the pouring rain. The fresh tracks from the Blacksmithy lead you along the paved road until you reach the northern perimeter of the village. Here they leave the highway and veer due east towards the Nagah Forest. A narrow woodsman&rsquo;s trail snakes its way through the Chai pines and the tracks can clearly be seen in its muddy surface. Your Sixth Sense screams a warning that this dense forest harbours an evil presence. You rein in your horse and scan the surrounding trees. At once you detect an ambush has been prepared and several evil creatures are lying in wait for you on the trail ahead.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to turn around and leave the forest, <a href="sect218.htm">go to 218</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you decide to continue along the trail, knowing that to do so will trigger the ambush, <a href="sect262.htm">turn to 262</a>.</p>
