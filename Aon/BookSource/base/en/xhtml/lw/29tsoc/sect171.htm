      <h3>171</h3>
      <p>A short way along Xiang Street there is brightly lit emporium that buys and sells all manner of goods. Quang wants to purchase a new compass; his army issue one was broken during the fighting at Vabou. You enter this spacious shop and stare in awe at the thousands of items it has for sale. Quang and Deng approach the counter and while the Lieutenant is examining an array of compasses, you browse the shelves. All of the items are labelled and priced. Four of them catch your eye:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Arrows: 10 Ren each (1 Gold Crown each)</li>
       <li>Lantern: 20 Ren (2 Gold Crowns)</li>
       <li>Rope (50 ft. length): 30 Ren (3 Gold Crowns)</li>
       <li>Potion of Laumspur: 40 Ren (4 Gold Crowns) Restores 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> when swallowed after combat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may buy any of the items listed above for the price indicated. With the exception of the Arrows, they are all Backpack Items that will take up one space in your backpack. You are under no obligation to make a purchase.</p>
      <p>You can also sell any of the items you have noted on your Backpack List (with the exception of Anseng&rsquo;s <i xml:lang="x-chaian">Kirusami</i>). The shop will pay 20 Ren for each item, regardless of how much it originally cost. If you wish to sell any of your items, erase them from your list and add 2 Gold Crowns (20 Ren) per item to your Belt Pouch.</p>
      <p>Quang finally decides which compass he is going to purchase and he hands 50 Ren to the shop assistant. The wife of the emporium&rsquo;s owner approaches him and they exchange a few words. She is concerned about Deng&rsquo;s morose demeanour and suggests that he would benefit from some Senara Tea. Quang agrees and he gives her 10 Ren. In return, she reaches for a bottle of the tea from the shelf behind her and places it on the counter. Quang uncorks the bottle and makes Deng drink it. The soothing liquid will help him to recover from his state of shock. When he has consumed the contents, you thank the woman and leave.</p>
      <p>At the end of Xiang Street you enter the quayside area. The churning waters of the estuary stretch out before you. Because of the heavy rain and failing light, you cannot see across the estuary to the opposite bank and have no way of judging how wide it is at this point. Quang asks a passer-by for directions to the ferry post and she points south and tells you that it is a five minute walk is that direction. Soon you reach the post and see the ferry boat to Dwala is moored at the quay. You approach it, hoping that you are in time to catch the dusk crossing, but you find that access to this part of the quay has been chained off. A sign hanging from the chain says: <span class="signpost">Ferry cancelled due to weather</span>.</p>
      <p>Directly opposite the quay is a large three-storey building. The ornate sign fixed above its front door says: <span class="signpost">Ferry House Inn</span>
      </p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to enter the Ferry House Inn, <a href="sect114.htm">turn to 114</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you decide to look for someone on the quayside with a boat, and who is prepared to take you across the stormy estuary, <a href="sect202.htm">turn to 202</a>.</p>
