      <h3>184</h3>
      <p>Quang and Deng accept your decision with good grace. Chao is delighted and eagerly he leads you along the main street to his modest home on the eastern edge of the village. You dismount and tether your horses beneath an open-sided shelter at the side of the two-storey house. Chao leads you around to the front door and knocks four times. You hear the sound of scurrying feet and the door swings open. Before you stands Shen-Yin, Chao&rsquo;s wife. She beams with delight when she sees her husband and throws herself into his open arms. She is clearly overjoyed by his unexpected return. Chao motions you to enter and you go through into a parlour where five young children are sitting in a circle on the pine wood floor in front of a brick fireplace. They are happily playing with their toys. They look at you with quizzical expressions, but when they see their father in the doorway behind they leap to their feet and rush to embrace him.</p>
      <p>Shen-Yin relinquishes her hold on Chao and welcomes you to their home. With some difficulty, Chao gently extricates himself from the grip of his excited children and introduces you to his wife. Bai needs no introduction for he has visited here many times in the past. Chao tells Shen-Yin that you are bound for Valus on imperial business and that you can only stay here overnight. She is understandably disappointed to hear that her husband will be home for such a short time, but she puts on a brave face and draws comfort from the fact that they are together again, albeit briefly. She gathers the children and shoos them upstairs so that you have the parlour to yourselves. Then she disappears into the kitchen to prepare some tea and food for you all.</p>
      <p>After a simple but reviving meal and copious cups of tea, Chao and Shen-Yin retire upstairs leaving you and the others to sleep on the parlour floor. There is not much room but you are all thankful to be out of the rain and in warm home on this bleak and stormy night. You fall asleep with ease but you do not rest easily. You are haunted by dreams filled with sinister shadowy images and premonitions of impending loss. Thrice you awaken during the night, drenched in cold sweat, and each time you do you find it hard to go back to sleep. Due to your poor night&rsquo;s sleep and the chilling nightmares you have suffered, you lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>.</p>
      <p>Chao wakes you all up at dawn. While you are checking your equipment and preparing for another long day in the saddle, Shen-Yin prepares breakfast and brings it to you in the parlour. While you are eating, Quang tells you that it is a thirty mile ride from here to Valus and he wants to reach the town by late afternoon. You finish your food while listening to the sounds of the children playing in their room above. When the time comes to leave, Quang, Bai, and Deng go and feed the horses while you and Chao help Shen-Yin to clear away the breakfast dishes. You bid her thanks and walk to the front door to go and assist the others. Chao holds his doting wife in a warm and loving embrace and assures her that he will return soon. You are touched by the deep affection they have for each other. Quietly, you exit the door and see Quang leading two horses, yours and Chao&rsquo;s, out of the shelter by their reins. You climb into the saddle and hold Chao&rsquo;s horse alongside. Soon you are joined by Quang, Bai, and Deng astride their mounts and patiently you wait for Chao to appear. After a few minutes, Quang calls out:</p>
      <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s time to go, Chao!&rsquo;</p>
      <p>The door opens and Chao and his wife share a final embrace in the doorway before Chao, sheepishly, bids a final farewell to his wife and climbs into the saddle. With a wave, Shen-Yin bids you goodbye and Godspeed as you set off along the highway heading east from Jueng.</p>
