      <h3>203</h3>
      <p>As you continue your ride south, the cloud and persistent rain becomes increasingly darker and heavier. The tall grassland gradually recedes and your horses are able to pick up their pace, but you are sorely aware that the easier going will also help the Skarada to track you. After an hour spent crossing the plain, you spot something in the distance that makes you call your companions to a halt. You magnify your vision and focus on the dark shape ahead.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;What is it, my Lord?&rsquo; asks Quang, anxiously.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Skarada,&rsquo; you reply, uneasily. &lsquo;Lots of Skarada.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You can see a large formation of the creatures more than five hundred strong. They are moving towards the east and are crossing your route of escape. The lieutenant proposes that you change direction and head south-eastwards. This will put you on a course to Vabou and should enable you to reach the town ahead of the Skarada horde. You and the Watchers agree to the lieutenant&rsquo;s proposal and together you set off at a brisk pace.</p>
      <p>You reach the west gate of Vabou shortly after dark. The two sentries posted here come smartly to attention and salute the instant they recognize Quang&rsquo;s Imperial Guard insignia. Hurriedly they push open the gate and you ride into the town, along the same road that you travelled two days ago when you arrived here by wagon with Anseng and Chengu. Quang takes the lead and the rest of you follow as he canters his horse along the lantern-lit road to a junction at the centre of the town. He is familiar with Vabou, having stopped here overnight on many occasions whilst travelling from Pensei to Valus to meet with the town&rsquo;s military commander.</p>
      <p>Quang crosses the junction and brings his horse to a halt before a large green-tiled two storey building with a tall bell tower. It is the house of the town elder and headquarters of the Vabou militia. You all dismount and follow the lieutenant through its ornate arched doorway. When you stride into the reception hall, you find Elder Qinlau and Militia Captain Xing seated at a large pine table heaped with parchments. They are locked in conversation. Both of them turn their heads, recognise the familiar face of Lieutenant Quang, and immediately stand up and salute him.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an unexpected pleasure to see you again, Quang,&rsquo; says Captain Xing. &lsquo;But what brings you here at this late hour?&rsquo;</p>
      <p>The lieutenant tells Captain Xing of your difficult journey from Pensei, your encounter with the Skarada and your discovery of the refugee massacre in the hills. Both Elder Qinlau and Xing are visibly shocked by his chilling report. Quang informs them that a large force of Skarada is heading for Vabou from the west, and he urges Xing to muster his militiamen and deploy them on the palisade wall at once. He is certain that the enemy will attack Vabou during the night.</p>
      <p>The Captain tugs a large scroll from under the pile of documents and clears the table with one swift sweep of his arm. Quickly, he unfurls the parchment and lays it out on the bare table top. It is a detailed plan of Vabou. He motions Quang and yourself to come forward and examine it.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see that there are four watchtowers located in palisade wall, at the north, south, east and west corners. I have only 100 militiamen at my command, just 25 men to deploy at each of the towers and its adjoining section of wall.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>&lsquo;The Skarada will most likely attack either the west or north wall,&rsquo; says Quang, &lsquo;I suggest you deploy 30 militiamen at each of these points, man the south and east watchtowers with 5 men apiece, and hold back a mobile reserve of 30 men ready to plug any gaps or counter any enemy that break through the walls.&rsquo; Captain Xing nods in agreement.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Quang asks the Captain if he may take a few minutes to speak to you and the Watchers. The Captain consents and Quang takes you and the Watchers to one side. He speaks with a hushed voice.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;My Lord, our only hope of getting you to your rendezvous in two days&rsquo; time is if we help Captain Xing to defeat the Skarada. We all saw this afternoon that the enemy is moving in force towards this town from the west. It&rsquo;s certain the first few miles of the highway to H&rsquo;lau are now in their hands. If we can defeat them when they attack Vabou, we may get a chance to break out of the town and head for H&rsquo;lau across the Huzang Plain. Clearly, it&rsquo;s now too late to leave Vabou by the south road. If we were to try to reach Klatii in the rain and darkness, the Skarada would slay us before we&rsquo;d got beyond a mile of the town&rsquo;s south gate.&rsquo; You all know that Quang is correct and, as one, you consent to his proposal; you will stay and fight.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;We will help with the defence,&rsquo; says Quang, much to Captain Xing&rsquo;s relief. His militia are adequately armed, but they are not trained soldiers. They will fight hard to protect their town and their families, of this he is sure, but he is afraid they will be no match for the Skarada in close combat. It will greatly improve the odds to have a Kai Grand Master, an Imperial Bodyguard, and three able Watchers fighting alongside them. Both Xing and Elder Qinlau thank you for your help. The Captain says that your service would be best put to use where the threat of attack is greatest: at the West and North watchtowers.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to go to the North Watchtower and help the militia prepare to defend it, <a href="sect177.htm">turn to 177</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you decide to go the West Watchtower and help the militia prepare to defend it, <a href="sect104.htm">turn to 104</a>.</p>
