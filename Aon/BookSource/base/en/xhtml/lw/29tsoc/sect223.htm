      <h3>223</h3>
      <p>The evil power that brought Anseng back from the dead is the same fell force that has compelled the Skarada and Chagarashi to attack Vabou this night. By slaying the undead Anseng, you have banished this force and broken the spell that has driven the creatures to assault the town walls. The Skarada that are fighting Quang and the Watchers are devastated by the sudden lifting of the spell and their nerve shatters. Desperately, they break off from the fight and scramble to escape through the hole in the palisade wall.</p>
      <p>Quang and the Watchers let them go. They have put up a good fight against a strong enemy, but they have all sustained wounds in the combat. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Curing, you staunch their wounds and repair the gouges and punctures caused by Skarada fangs and talons. Your companions are thankful to have you on their side. As they carry out a makeshift repair on the hole in the East wall, you return to Anseng&rsquo;s ashes and offer up a silent prayer to God Kai to save the soul of this brave man. You are finishing your prayer when you hear the sound of the bell tolling in the tower at militia headquarters. It is announcing victory; the battle has been won!</p>
      <p>You return to the militia headquarters where you are greeted by a jubilant Elder Qinlau and Captain Xing. The enemy are fleeing from Vabou and the town has been spared the massacre that would surely have followed if they had broken through the palisade wall. Quang and the Watchers are exhausted and in desperate need of rest. You resolve to get some sleep here at the headquarters and leave at daybreak. Elder Qinlau provides you all with food (restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>) before you take your leave and go to the stables. The bales of hay stored in the stables&rsquo; loft provide you with a soft bed for the night.</p>
