      <h3>238</h3>
      <p>Lord Honos and Herbwarden Zautro come running up the stairs from the convent&rsquo;s cellar. They are covered with plaster dust and look badly shaken. You ask if Priestess Song Tao is safe. They glance at each other and then look dejectedly at the floor and shake their heads.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Grand Master,&rsquo; says the Captain, urgently. &lsquo;You must leave here. It is too dangerous for you to stay any longer.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>He stands in the open doorway and points along the alley to a passageway at the southern end.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Turn right at the end and the passage will take you to Izara Street. Go left when you reach Izara and you&rsquo;ll soon arrive at the Main Square. Look for the sign to the Quay. Follow the sign and you&rsquo;ll be sure to reach the quayside. Make your way to the stone pier in the middle of the quayside and look for the <cite>Silver Virixe</cite>. She is a Korlian cargo ship berthed at the end of the pier. She will be bound for the Port of Suhn as soon as the storms abate. Go aboard her and hide yourself below deck. If it is safe to do so, we will come for you an hour before noon and bring you back here to the North Gate in time for Lord Rimoah&rsquo;s arrival.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>&lsquo;And what if you don&rsquo;t come?&rsquo; you ask, pragmatically.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;If we don&rsquo;t come for you,&rsquo; replies Jian Tzu, &lsquo;then the situation here will have escalated beyond our control. You should remain hidden aboard the ship. Once it sails and is safely beyond the estuary, you should make yourself known to the Captain. His name is Chengan. He is a Watcher and he is loyal to our cause. He will convey you to the Port of Suhn and from there you will be able to make contact with your Kai Monastery on the Isle of Lorn. We will send word of this to Lord Rimoah&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp; if we are able.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You acknowledge the Captain&rsquo;s words and set off from the kitchen doorway. But you have barely taken a dozen steps along the alleyway when you see a group of leathery black creatures appear in the passageway beyond. They are armed with iron bows. One of them raises its bow and a black arrow comes speeding directly towards your head!</p>
      <p class="choice">If you possess Magi-magic and wish to use it, <a href="sect78.htm">turn to 78</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you possess Kai-alchemy, have attained the rank of Sun Knight or higher, and wish to use your advanced skill, <a href="sect170.htm">turn to 170</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you do not possess any of these Grand Master Disciplines, have not yet achieved the rank required, of if you choose not to use them, <a href="sect290.htm">turn to 290</a>.</p>
