      <h3>270</h3>
      <p>The sergeant enters the blockhouse with two of his men and slams the door shut behind them. He orders them to take your Kai Weapon and bring it to him. He walks to the middle of the bare brick room and inspects it in the light of a solitary ceiling lantern.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;You, go fetch the Captain,&rsquo; he says, curtly, to one of the guardsmen. Obediently the man leaves the blockhouse chamber to carry out the sergeant&rsquo;s command.</p>
      <p>A few minutes later he returns with a tall officer who is clad resplendently in his palace uniform. The sergeant shows him your Kai Weapon and he relaxes his stern expression.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Where is Anseng?&rsquo; he asks.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;We were separated from one another during the ride to Pensei,&rsquo; you reply. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure where he is, or even if he&rsquo;s still alive.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>To the sergeant&rsquo;s surprise, the officer returns your Kai Weapon and gives you a formal salute.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Stand down, Sergeant Jeou. You have carried out your duties well. Now I&rsquo;ll take charge of this man. You and your men may return to your posts.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>The sergeant salutes his senior officer and, without any murmur of dissent, he signals to his men to leave the blockhouse. He follows as they file out of the chamber and pauses only to close the stout door behind him.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been briefed to expect you, but I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that Anseng is missing. He&rsquo;s a fine man, an exemplary guardsman. I pray to Ishir he&rsquo;ll find his way here before the siege begins.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Captain Voushan formally introduces himself and tells you what has happened in Pensei over the past few days.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;An attack was launched upon Fort Jhung, two days ago, by Bhanarian forces and a horde of Agarashi commanded by the dark wizard they call Zashnor. It was destroyed in a blizzard of lightning and crumbled to the ground. None of the fort&rsquo;s garrison is known to have survived. The destruction of Fort Jhung created a breach in the Chai Wall through which Zashnor&rsquo;s army has poured like water through a broken dam. Yesterday at dawn, the enemy vanguard was first sighted on the west road. By dusk, they&rsquo;d reached the city wall. All throughout today their numbers have grown greater as the bulk of Zashnor&rsquo;s invasion force has arrived from the ruins of Fort Jhung. Many of our citizens have abandoned their homes and are heading south to take refuge in the towns of Valus and Hi&rsquo;joi. I have deployed the guard and garrison of Pensei along the west wall. Only a small bodyguard remains here in the palace under my command. Lao Tin received word of your coming from three Watchers who arrived here yesterday from Dwala. I am privy to the Prince&rsquo;s plans and I can assure you that the item you seek will be given to you gladly. Lao Tin is young but he is wise beyond his years. He believes that Zashnor craves that which you are determined to deny him, and he hopes the sorcerer will withdraw his forces from the city when he discovers that it is no longer here.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Captain Voushan bids you follow him to the keep of the Imperial Palace where Prince Lao Tin resides. You leave the blockhouse in his company and cross a parade ground on your way to the doors of the keep. On one side of the parade ground, illuminated by a circle of guttering torches, two men in torn clothing kneel in the pouring rain with their heads bowed and their hands tied behind their backs. Behind them stand two Imperial Guardsmen at attention with their <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusamis</i> held diagonally across their chests.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to ask Captain Voushan who the kneeling men are, <a href="sect146.htm">turn to 146</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you choose not to ask the Captain this question, <a href="sect127.htm">turn to 127</a>.</p>
