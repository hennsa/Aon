      <h3>330</h3>
      <p>Upon the instant you defeat the Spectral Entity, its ghostly body and the dome of dark energy both vanish in the blink of an eye. Anseng regains his ability to speak, but the shock of the supernatural encounter leaves him agitated and wary. You sense that the presence of evil that has haunted you since entering this hilly and wooded area has now gone. Tranquillity has returned to this region. Anseng and the horse team are reassured by this welcome return to normality and you resume your journey to Vabou with all haste.</p>
      <p>Night falls long before you reach the town. The way ahead is illuminated by bright moonlight that pours through a break in the leaden clouds and is reflected in the puddles that cover the waterlogged highway. You offer up a silent prayer of thanks to Goddess Ishir for this blessing she has bestowed upon you and your companions, for it enables the horse team to follow the highway across the Huzang Plain with little difficulty.</p>
      <p>It is an hour before midnight when you see the lights of Vabou in the middle distance. This large town is surrounded by a wooden palisade, lending it a fort-like appearance. Upon reaching the town&rsquo;s west gate, you are waved down by two town guardsmen with glowing lanterns. They recognise the <i xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</i> that Anseng is armed with and respectfully they salute him. They are aware that only the Imperial Guard are permitted to own and use such weapons, and only the most distinguished former-members of the Guard are allowed to retain their coveted polearm when they retire from service. Beyond the west gate, you trundle along a wide shop-lined street that leads to a junction where it joins the main highway connecting the town of Klatii with the capital, Pensei. During your night journey to Vabou, Chengu has fully recovered from the shock of his ordeal and has resumed his role as wagoneer. Anseng directs him along the central highway to a large inn called The Golden Dragon. It is here that you bid farewell to Chengu and climb down from his wagon. He wishes you both good luck and farewell before he sets off for the house of his brother and family on the east side of the town.</p>
      <p>Despite the late hour, the Golden Dragon is still open for business. The rains have returned and Anseng beckons you to follow as he climbs the wide stone steps from the street to the inn&rsquo;s front door.</p>
