      <h3>36</h3>
      <p>You tether your horse to the consulate&rsquo;s railings and climb the steps to the front door. It is unlocked. You enter and find yourself standing in a long hallway, hung with portraits of Durenese Kings and former Consuls to Chai. In a reception room immediately to your left you find a well-dressed old man who is throwing sheaves of paper onto a blazing log fire. You introduce yourself and his eyes widen when he hears that you are a Kai Grand Master. &lsquo;My Lord, it&rsquo;s an honour to meet you. I&rsquo;m Grevan Helsar, an envoy in the staff of the Consul of Durenor. How may I assist you?&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You ask the aged envoy why so many citizens of Pensei are leaving the city. He explains that the Bhanarian army is amassing at the city&rsquo;s west wall and they fear that an attack is imminent. He tells you that the consulate staff left Pensei four days ago when news arrived that Fort Jhung had fallen and the Chai Wall had been breached by the Bhanarians and the Agarashi. He volunteered to stay behind and destroy the consulate&rsquo;s files and papers to prevent them falling into enemy hands. When you tell him that you are on a vital mission and that you are looking for the Imperial Palace to seek an audience with Khea-khan Lao Tin, he offers his assistance.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Of course I will help you all I can, my Lord. The way to the Imperial Palace is quite simple. If you continue along Tzushen Avenue you&rsquo;ll come to the Zha-zhing Circle. The way to the palace is clearly signposted at this junction. But if you are to gain an audience with the Khea-khan, you will need to enter the palace itself. As you can imagine, the Imperial Guard are on high alert and it will not be easy to enter unless you have a pass. Now, this is something I am able to help you with.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Envoy Helsar removes a thin rectangular piece of black lacquered toa wood from his pocket and hands it to you.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my consulate pass. It permits me entry to the palace. However, I should tell you that I can&rsquo;t guarantee that it&rsquo;ll allow you to enter. In normal times it would, but these are far from being normal times.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You thank the envoy and examine the wooden pass. It is engraved with the consulate emblem and inlaid with silver numerals that you are unable to decipher. You tuck the pass into your jacket pocket and bid him good luck and farewell before you take your leave. You should record the Durenese Consulate Pass on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.</p>
