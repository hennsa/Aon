      <p>Anseng passes you a scrap of paper on which to write down your answer and tells you to write your name on the reverse side. When the hourglass runs out, Tzu shouts: &lsquo;Time&rsquo;s up!&rsquo; The patrons hold up the scraps of paper on which they have written their answer and their name, and these are quickly gathered up by Yeng Zhi. She gives them to Shou Len and he removes the ones that have the correct answer. You are pleased to see that your scrap of paper is among them!<sup><a href="#sect41-1-foot" id="sect41-1">6</a></sup>

      <p>Well done, you have answered the riddle correctly. It was 41 years ago that the mother (who is now 80 years old) was exactly three times the age of her daughter. The daughter was 13 years old and the mother was 39 years old.</p>
      <p>You and only two other patrons solved the puzzle. You are happy to see that one of the other winners is Anseng. Yeng Zhi collects your winnings and places them on your table, together with your original bet in its paper wrap. You have won an amount equal to double your wager. You may now restore the number of Gold Crowns you deducted from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, and add twice that number to your total.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to wager on Shou Len&rsquo;s second riddle, <a href="sect110.htm">turn to 110</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you decide to bid Anseng good night and retire to your room upstairs, <a href="sect286.htm">turn to 286</a>.</p>
