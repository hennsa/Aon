      <h3>47</h3>
      <p>A Kraan! Never have Kraan ventured this far south from the Darklands of Northern Magnamund before. You recall the doomwolves you encountered during your journey from Vabou to Valus and realise the only possible reasons for why they are now present in Chai. Nadziran Zashnor has either brought them here, or the foul sorcerer has established spawning pits somewhere in Southern Magnamund and is creating them to bolster the size of his invading army.</p>
      <p>The shrieking Kraan banks away from the quayside and circles around to make another pass over the pier. You see two smaller creatures riding pillion in a saddle strapped to its scaly back. You magnify your vision and recognise that they are the same kind of creatures that attempted to block your escape along the alleyway beside the convent. Your Magnakai Discipline of Divination tells you that these hairless black leathery bipeds are Doomgah, a new breed of horrors created by Zashnor in its Spawning Pits located below the evil Bhanarian temple-city of Bakhasa. Your senses also reveal that Zashnor has been able to draw upon the souls of myriad victims sacrificed by Autarch Sejanoz during his long and bloody reign. They were imprisoned in the Bakhasian temples and used to supply raw power to its voracious spawning vats. The Doomgah are watching you intently through slitted eyes that emit a dull orange glow.</p>
      <p>The Kraan flies away in the direction of the Main Square and then circles back, cawing loudly. It is directing a dozen Doomgah that are in Xo Street to race towards your location. They soon reach the end of the thoroughfare and come scurrying across the quay towards the entrance to the central pier. They are armed with black iron bows and serrated swords. When they reach the pier they draw their swords and give vent to a snickering battle cry.</p>
