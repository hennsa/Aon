      <h3>55</h3>
      <p>Despite the rumbling thunder, howling winds, and heavy rain beating on the shingle roof of the hut, you soon drift off into a deep and dreamless sleep. Four hours later you are awoken by Anseng&rsquo;s strong hand shaking your shoulder.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Wake up, my Lord. It&rsquo;s time to go.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>The noise of the night storm has disappeared. The only sound you can hear outside is a dawn chorus of chittering bird song. You rise from your mattress and gather your weapons and equipment. When you are ready, Anseng takes you to a stable at the rear of the hut where two horses are saddled ready to ride. He prepared them while you were sleeping. Leaving the stable, you and Anseng set off along the muddy highway at a brisk pace. The rain and thunder have ceased, but the slowly brightening sky is heavy with thick grey clouds.</p>
      <p>As you ride along, you stare out across the lush green paddy fields bordering the road. On your way you pass by several isolated huts and houses. Their owners, all rice growers, are repairing roofs and walls that been damaged by the storm and they pay you scant regards as you ride past their humble abodes. Anseng says that you must reach the village of Zang before nightfall. You have a long day&rsquo;s ride ahead and there will be no time to stop and rest along the way. Unless you have a Meal in your Backpack, you lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. The need to stay in the saddle all day prevents you from foraging for food in the adjacent rice fields.</p>
      <p>During your long journey, you converse with Anseng and find out more about your trusty guide. He hails from the city of Dwala, approximately 200 miles due east of your present location. He is one of a group of covert agents established by the Elder Magi for the purpose of gathering intelligence about vengeful Bhanarians, obsessed with avenging the Massacre of Yua Tzhan, who are operating in and around Pensei. They have also been tasked with finding out why Agarashi have recently been sighted far from their lairs in the Hyunsei Foothills, the Voxai Swamp and, the Huzang Forest. The last time they found the courage to do so was seventeen years ago, when they joined the army of Autarch Sejanoz for the invasion of Chai. Anseng tells you that his group of agents are headquartered at the Tower of Ishir in Dwala. Here they meet regularly with Lord Rimoah&rsquo;s envoy and pass on all the information they have gathered about the enemy. Anseng is a proud member of this secret group of agents who call themselves &lsquo;The Watchers&rsquo;. While you are riding together, you notice an unusual polearm that is strapped to Anseng&rsquo;s saddle.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to ask Anseng about this weapon, <a href="sect248.htm">turn to 248</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you choose not to say anything about it, <a href="sect148.htm">turn to 148</a>.</p>
