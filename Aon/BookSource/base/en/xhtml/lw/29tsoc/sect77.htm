      <h3>77</h3>
      <p>Quang reaches to his belt pouch to pay for the beverages, but Shousun has a sudden change of mind.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;One moment, my Lord,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly let you have these ales for free if you&rsquo;d be so kind to tell me what is happening in the north.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Come a little closer,&rsquo; he says to the inquisitive innkeeper. &lsquo;I will tell you what we know, but I&rsquo;d prefer that not everyone in your fine establishment hears what I have to say.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Of course, my Lord,&rsquo; replies Shousun, with a wry smile. He moves closer to Quang and leans forward so that the Lieutenant can speak quietly in his ear. In a hushed voice, Quang tells him that some of the citizens of Pensei believe their city will be attacked by the Bhanarians. They have decided to leave their homes and travel to Hi&rsquo;joi by way of Vabou and Klatii. He tells him to have faith in the might of the Chai army and the wisdom of his Khea-khan. If the threat to Pensei is real, we shall prevail.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Thank you my Lord,&rsquo; says the innkeeper. Having now satisfied his curiosity, Shousun tells you that the ales are on the house. He says that it is an honour to have an Imperial Guardsman visit his humble inn and he invites you all to enjoy a meal and stay the night at his expense. Quang thanks him and accepts his hospitality.</p>
