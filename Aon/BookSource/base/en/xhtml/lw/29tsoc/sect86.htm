      <h3>86</h3>
      <p>You step back from the body of the dead doomwolf and stoop to pick up your Kai Weapon. As you return it to its scabbard, Quang and the Watchers come running to see if you are badly wounded. You nod your aching head and tell them that you are well enough to continue unaided. The remaining two doomwolves, having witnessed the deaths of their leader and the second strongest member of their pack, shuffle backwards to the far end of the fallen pine and lope away into the forest beyond with their tails between their legs. You feel sure that they will not be returning here in a hurry. As you watch them disappear into the trees, you feel a sudden wave of weakness wash through your body. It makes your stomach churn and leaves you gasping for breath. Once again, the Eye of Agarash has activated and this time it drains you of 5 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>.</p>
      <p>Wiping a trickle of cold sweat from your brow with the back of your trembling hand, you swallow hard and tell your companions that it is just the effect of the gash you have sustained to the back of your head. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Curing, you staunch the bleeding and repair your damaged flesh. Quang and the Watchers are impressed by the speed of your recovery and are reassured that you are indeed fit to go on. You mount your horses and leave the ravine without looking back.</p>
