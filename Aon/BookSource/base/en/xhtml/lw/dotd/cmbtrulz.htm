<h3>Rules for Combat</h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points are given in the text. Your aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points as possible yourself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points and the enemy’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through the use of Special Items or spells to your current <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> total.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Subtract the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>When you have your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="crtable.htm">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost by both Banedon and his adversary in this round of combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>On the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to both participants in the combat.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from Stage 3.<br /><br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points of either the enemy or Banedon are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Banedon is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Banedon proceeds but with his <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="crsumary.htm">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Banedon may lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may evade only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
