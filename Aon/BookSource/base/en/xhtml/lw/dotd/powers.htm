<h3>Magical Powers</h3>

<h4><a name="mksumary">Magical Powers</a></h4>

<p>You have mastered only <em>five</em> of the ten spells that the Magicians’ Guild call the ‘Brotherhood Spells’.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five spells, enter them in the ‘Brotherhood Spells’ section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="lightng">Lightning Hand</a></h5>

<p>This spell enables you to cast a bolt of lightning, simply by pointing a finger and concentrating upon the spell. Every time this spell is used you must deduct 3 from your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points total.</p>
<h5><a name="mndcharm">Mind Charm</a></h5>

<p>Casting this spell upon a person (or creature) will cause that person to regard you as a trusted friend. It will not allow you to control the person, but anything you do or say will be looked on as friendly.</p>
<h5><a name="invsshld">Invisible Shield</a></h5>

<p>When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier will form as protection from missiles and enemies. However, it will not protect you from magical attacks, and every time it is used you must deduct 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points from your score.</p>
<h5><a name="net">Net</a></h5>

<p>This spell enables you to cast a web-like net of magical rope at a chosen target. It can be used to ensnare an enemy, or to enable you to climb high walls or obstacles with ease.</p>
<h5><a name="vigour">Vigour</a></h5>

<p>Casting this spell will increase your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> by 3 points for the duration of one combat, at the cost of 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. It cannot be used if your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points total is below 10.</p>
<h5><a name="countspl">Counterspell</a></h5>

<p>This spell may be used to protect yourself, or another person or object of your choice, from a magical attack. Use of this spell costs 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<h5><a name="levitn">Levitation</a></h5>

<p>This spell may be cast upon yourself, or upon another person or object, to cancel the effects of gravity, and thereby make the affected object rise into the air. The spell lasts no more than a few minutes and its usage costs 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<h5><a name="sensevil">Sense Evil</a></h5>

<p>When this spell is cast it will enable you to detect the presence of evil in any creature or object close by. However, perils such as traps or naturally poisonous animals will not be detected through the use of this spell.</p>
<h5><a name="mend">Mend</a></h5>

<p>This spell can be used to repair damaged items or to restore lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. In order for the spell to work, you must be standing in fresh running water, such as a river or stream, when the spell is cast. Using this spell upon yourself will restore 5 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
<h5><a name="silence">Silence</a></h5>

<p>Casting this spell will muffle the sound of any movement that you make.</p>
