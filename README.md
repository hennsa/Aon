# Project Aon Companion

Project Aon Companion aims to turn the Lone Wolf game books by Joe Dever into a standalone, interactive application inspired by the online editions published by Project Aon (https://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Home). The goal is to deliver the same sense of adventure as the classic “choose your own path” books, while providing modern conveniences like built-in character management and digital dice.

## Vision

The application will simulate the experience of reading and playing Lone Wolf books in a self-contained app. It will:

- Present the story as navigable sections, mirroring the structure of the original game books.
- Track character stats, skills, weapons, items, and other equipment automatically.
- Provide random number generation to handle combat, chance, and other game mechanics.
- Maintain a clear, intuitive flow between story sections so readers can focus on the adventure.

Project Aon’s web editions make these books easily readable online, and this project extends that experience into a dedicated app that feels like a modern, immersive game book companion.

## Status

This project is in its early stages. The README and design will evolve as features are planned and implemented.
